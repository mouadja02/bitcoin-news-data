From backing Bitcoin to providing surety that crypto will be a priority, Vance received some loudest cheers. Vice President JD Vance Delivers Remarks at Bitcoin 2025 Conference at Las Vegas, NV https://t.co/m2IIVUS1j4 — Vice President JD Vance (@VP) May 28, 2025 “There’s a new sheriff in town,” Vance declared. “After four years of hostility from Democrat regulators, crypto finally has a champion in the White House, ” he said over Trump’s comeback. Vance also took a swipe at former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is often the target of the crypto community. Vance calls Gensler’s crackdown a disaster “We fired Gary Gensler and we’re going to fire everyone like him,” he said, receiving loud applause. He called the Biden administration’s approach and Gary Gensler’s actions – a complete disaster and added that these regulators hold back innovation in the name of protecting consumer interest. Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Is Dead, Says Vance “We prioritize eliminating the rules, the red tape, and the lawfare that we saw aimed at our crypto by our predecessors,” Vance said. “We’re ending the weaponization of federal regulations against this community. To put it simply, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is dead, and it is not coming back under the Trump administration.” Currently, 50 million Amercians own crypto and he expects the number to double and warned that without clear rules, the $3 trillion crypto industry could easily move offshore. These remarks are in line with Trump’s previous statement during the election as he pledged to remove Gensler on day one if elected. Paul Atkins is now appointed in his place who has a pro-crypto background.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/jd-vance-vows-to-fire-more-regulators-like-gary-gensler-who-are-against-crypto/,"BTC|REGULATION","News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T08:40:22.000Z,"Trump family pushes crypto agenda from every angle","Donald Trump is pushing every chip forward, tying his entire family’s wealth to Bitcoin while sitting in the White House during his second term. The US president, according to Bloomberg, is worth $5.2 billion, and now a massive chunk of that is about to rise or crash with the price of crypto. The gamble is being executed through Trump Media and Technology Group, a company that’s been losing money for years and just revealed a new plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin. The company reported on Tuesday that it will sell $1.5 billion worth of stock and issue another $1 billion in convertible bonds to fund the purchase. Its latest filing showed the company held just $759 million in cash and investments as of Q1, making the raise necessary to cover the full cost. Cantor Fitzgerald is advising on the deal, which is expected to close by May 29. Devin Nunes, the CEO of Trump Media, described Bitcoin as “ the apex instrument of financial freedom ,” confirming that the purchase will be central to the company’s new direction. Trump family pushes crypto agenda from every angle Trump has appointed regulators favorable to the industry, built a national crypto reserve, ended federal prosecutions of crypto firms, and even issued presidential pardons for industry figures. But this week, that policy support became personal. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have been actively promoting crypto across the globe, appearing at conferences in Abu Dhabi, Washington, and Dubai over the last few months. This week, they’re scheduled to appear again, this time in Las Vegas, alongside Vice President JD Vance. Their attendance at these events is drawing criticism over conflicts of interest, especially as the financial health of their family’s businesses now depends heavily on Bitcoin’s price. At the same time, Trump Media’s core product, Truth Social, is bleeding cash. The company brought in only $820,000 in revenue last quarter and lost $38 million. In 2024, it reported a net loss of $401 million. Yet despite these figures, Trump continues to hold onto a major stake. Through a trust overseen by Donald Jr., Trump owns $2.6 billion worth of shares in the company. The pivot to Bitcoin mirrors a broader trend. According to CoinGecko, over 30 US companies now hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries, and analysts at Bernstein say the asset could attract $330 billion in institutional capital by 2030. Trump Media’s is just the loudest. Crypto deals multiply across Trump-linked businesses Just hours after Trump Media’s announcement, other companies tied to Trump-world joined the action. PSQ Holdings, where Donald Jr. is a board member, said it would begin to “ explore ” holding crypto as part of its assets. Strive Asset Management, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, launched a $750 million Bitcoin fund that same day. All of it points to a coordinated push across Trump’s business network to buy into the crypto boom. In the government itself, allies are also moving. Cantor Equity Partners, a SPAC run by Brandon Lutnick, the son of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is working with Tether and Softbank Group to launch a new venture called Twenty One Capital with the aim of building a Bitcoin stockpile. Trump’s connections don’t stop there. Major holders like Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Elon Musk’s Tesla are already heavily invested in Bitcoin. Metaplanet, a Tokyo-based firm where Eric is now listed as an adviser, has also been aggressively adding crypto to its portfolio. And Hut 8, now a majority stakeholder in a new mining company backed by Trump’s family, is the latest to step into the space. Bitcoin’s price has responded to all the attention. It surged past $112,000 last week, setting a new record. Since Trump won reelection in November, Bitcoin is up 55%. But while Bitcoin’s value surged, Trump Media shares dropped by 34%, proving just how unstable the company remains even as it gets into crypto. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025. Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for May 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 ADA Price Prediction 2026 Cardano Price Targets 2027 ADA Price Forecast 2028 ADA Price Analysis 2029 Cardano Price Prediction 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.75249998 -0.11% Market Cap $ 26,589,221,374.2050 Trading Volume $ 680,682,813.2227 Circulating Supply 35,334,514,487.4673 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for May 2025 The ADA price last parabolic shift was seen during Q4 2024, it leaped to $1.32 high, but increased bearish pressure pushed its price action into a declining wedge. In April of Q2 2025, the bear tried its best to break the support zone near $0.6, but the bullish forces gave the supporting shoulder to the falling ADA price. With bullish forces, it came right back above the high volume profile level, and made higher-highs and higher-lows till it reached $0.85 by mid-May. However, despite being above the 20-day EMA band and the 50-day EMA band, its price action is consolidating and RSI is at the median line, which shows that investors lack the bullish conviction. Also inside that channel ADA risks triangle breakdown amid a bearish pressure surge. For a conclusive breakdown, the price must close below the 50-day EMA at $0.7347, which could extend the decline to $0.60 and $0.40. In case of a bullish momentum revitalizes, then with a closing above the $0.85 resistance level, which is its previous swing high resistance that also aligns with the falling channel’s upper border resistance. Once it clears that hurdle, then it might retest the supply level at $1.10 by May or June 2025, which is a long-standing resistance level since mid-December 2024. Also, the Cardano liquidation map over 7 days shows the strength of bearish positions increasing. The cumulative short leverage positions (marked with green color) are indicative of bears’ tremendous interest in pushing the ADA price down in the short term. In addition, one of the clearest signs that there could be trouble ahead for ADA is the presence of declining funding rates. This could lead to continued price consolidation or a possible decline soon, it is clear that in short term the market lacks a clear catalyst for a breakout. ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

2025-05-29T08:26:22.000Z,"Older Bitcoin Holders Are Spending Their BTC Again: Profit-taking or Strategic Reallocation?","As bitcoin cools off from the latest rally, BTC sitting in wallets belonging to long-term holders has begun to move again. This raises the question of whether these moves are profit-taking by this investor cohort or merely strategic reallocation for further price appreciation. Data from the market research and intelligence firm Glassnode shows that the rise in spending has driven the aggregate volume from the one-year to 5-year cohorts to $4.02 billion. This is the highest level since February. Bitcoin OGs Are Spending Again According to Glassnode, this is the fifth-largest one-year to five-year spending spike of this bull cycle. This surge is driven by older Bitcoin holders – investors who have held their coins for three to five years. Since the beginning of this bull run, older Bitcoin holders have recorded massive volumes after each BTC rally. The investors have spent significant amounts of BTC in March, October, November 2024, and February 2025. The largest spending so far this cycle occurred in October 2024, with $9.25 billion led by the one- to two-year cohort. The second and third largest were in March 2024 and February 2025, $6.11 billion and $5.42 billion, respectively, led by the two-year to three-year cohort. The fourth-largest was recorded in November 2024, $4.39 billion, driven by the three-year to five-year cohort. The three-year to five-year Bitcoin holder cohort is once again leading the latest spending spike with $2.16 billion. Glassnode noted that this is their second-largest outflow of the cycle, following an approximately $6 billion outflow in March 2024. On the other hand, the two-year to three-year and one-year to two-year cohorts have spent about $1.41 billion and $450 million, respectively, this time. Consolidation or Deeper Correction? Although it remains unclear whether OG wallets are waking up to collect profits or reallocate their holdings, BTC has been in a correction mode over the last six days. The cryptocurrency has slipped more than 4% from its recent all-time high of $111,970, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, BTC was worth around $107,540, with a 3% weekly decline and a 1.2% 24-hour drop. If reallocation is the goal of older Bitcoin holders, then BTC may consolidate some more in the coming days. However, if they are taking profits, then the asset could record a deeper correction, possibly slipping below $106,000.

According to its recent press release , Antalpha aims to diversify its holdings in the face of macroeconomic volatility by investing in Tether ( USDT )’s digital gold token, XAUt ( XAUT ). The platform chose the token because of its gold-backed value that is believed to be suitable for institutional asset allocation, particularly its ability to withstand crypto market cycles and support different financial applications. Therefore, the company plans to allocate as much as $40 million from its portfolio into XAUt by June 30, 2026. The Tether-issued token is poised to be the Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining platform’s “cornerstone collateral asset” within its loan structure. As part of its ongoing investment strategy, Antalpha plans to acquire more digital assets like XAUt in the long run to obtain funding for its lending operations.

Additionally, Antalpha plans to launch a new portal on its website that would provide real-time market information on XAUt and its underlying physical gold assets. Aside from accepting Bitcoin and other mining collateral for crypto financing, the platform will also start accepting XAUt and GPU for AI compute as collateral loans. Moreover, Antalpha also plans to expand its margin loan offering through its partnership with Northstar to include Ethereum ( ETH ) margin loans on the Antalpha Prime platform. Chief Financial Officer of Antalpha, Paul Liang, said that its new “digital gold” strategy aims to fulfill its clients’ diverse needs and spearhead the digital asset financing industry by expanding on its institutional-grade lending solutions. “We are building Antalpha for the long term, with transparency, prudence and risk management at the core,” said Liang. Last April, Tether’s latest attestation report showed that the company had accumulated more than 7.7 tons of physical gold to back its tokenized asset, Tether Gold.

2025-05-29T08:14:57.000Z,"Russia now allows banks to offer crypto-linked products to qualified investors","The Bank of Russia is finally letting crypto through the door, but only for people who meet a very high bar. On Wednesday, the central bank said financial institutions in Russia can now offer their wealthiest and most experienced clients access to crypto-linked investments. This decision, according to a press release from the Bank of Russia, allows licensed firms to provide non-deliverable products—things like derivatives and securities—whose returns depend on crypto prices. But investors won’t actually receive any crypto. The whole system has been built to keep coins out of clients’ hands. This isn’t open season for crypto in Russia though. The central bank made it clear that only qualified investors will be allowed to touch these products. Every bank offering them has to apply strict risk controls, fully cover these investments with capital, and set individual limits on exposure. The Bank said it plans to formalize this conservative approach later in the year, building a regulatory framework around the price volatility of crypto. At the same time, it warned both institutions and their clients to stay away from direct crypto purchases, repeating its long-standing position against retail trading. Government considers crypto sandbox, Sberbank joins regulated exchanges The Russian government is currently reviewing a proposal from the Bank of Russia to create a testing zone for actual crypto transactions. The idea is to launch a special regime where only certain investors will be allowed to buy or sell crypto directly. That plan was introduced in March, and if approved, will run for three years under a system called the EPR, or experimental legal regime. Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Bank of Russia, told the Russian Stock Market 2025 conference on May 16 that the crypto market needs both new laws and stronger infrastructure before it can grow in Russia. She said the EPR would only be open to investors who pass strict qualifications. According to the plan, anyone who wants to join the sandbox must hold more than 100 million rubles in securities and deposits or make at least 50 million rubles per year. Nabiullina also said discussions are ongoing about how to finalize those rules, and the government is expected to help speed that process. While the Bank works on tightening the rules, Russia’s biggest lender is already preparing to step in. Alexander Zozulya, head of global markets at Sberbank, said the bank plans to act as a liquidity provider for the country’s regulated crypto platforms. These platforms are being designed exclusively for highly vetted investors, not for the public. “We will serve as a market maker on these regulated exchanges,” Zozulya said, adding that the goal is to bring structure and reliability to crypto trading within approved limits. Trump fuels Russian crypto surge, oil companies use bitcoin in trade The Bank of Russia also pointed to a massive surge in crypto activity coming from inside the country. Over the last quarter of 2024 and the first three months of 2025, crypto flows tied to Russian residents increased by over 51% compared to the previous six months. The Bank reported that Russians moved 7.3 trillion rubles, or around $91 billion, through major global crypto exchanges during that time. The Bank said that President Donald Trump’s administration is boosting international confidence in crypto, which is helping attract Russian interest. Trump’s support for Bitcoin has had an effect across global markets, with Russia being one of the countries responding fastest. Crypto is also now part of Russia’s foreign trade strategy. Many Russian oil companies have started using bitcoin, ether, and stablecoins like Tether to deal with China and India. These tokens help them convert yuan and rupees into rubles, especially in deals that bypass Western banking systems. Though still small, this crypto-based method is growing as part of Russia’s $192 billion oil trade, according to the International Energy Agency. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The move comes at a time when several countries, including the U.S., European Union, Japan, and the UK, have placed strict sanctions on Russia , many of them targeting digital assets and crypto usage. So, what exactly does this mean for the market and investors? Russia Allows Crypto-Linked Products In a statement released this week , the Bank of Russia confirmed that financial institutions are now allowed to offer products that are linked to cryptocurrency prices. These include derivatives, securities, and digital financial assets. But there’s a catch, these products cannot be settled in actual crypto. In short, investors won’t be receiving Bitcoin or Ethereum but only products tied to their price movements. And these products won’t be for everyone. Only “qualified investors,” a restricted group with the required experience and financial background, will be able to trade them. The Bank of Russia has announced it will allow financial institutions to offer crypto-linked derivatives, securities, and digital financial assets to qualified investors. These must be non-deliverable products, meaning investors won't directly receive crypto.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 Strict Controls and Risk Warnings Even with this new step, the Russian central bank isn’t diving into crypto without a safety net. It told banks and other credit institutions to be extremely careful with these products. They must fully back these instruments with capital and also set limits to avoid big risks. Over the coming year, the Bank of Russia also plans to formalize rules that would better manage risks tied to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices. Global Pressure Through Sanctions Many countries have already cracked down on Russia’s use of digital assets. After the Ukraine conflict, the U.S., EU, Japan, and the UK imposed sanctions that also covered crypto to prevent Russia from using it as a loophole to move money. Because of this, Russia has been trying to find new ways to explore the digital finance world without breaking global rules. Russia BTC Holding Even though crypto rules in Russia aren’t very clear, the country has a lot of Bitcoin. The Central Bank of Russia and some government offices have gotten bitcoin either by buying it directly or by seizing it from criminal activities. It’s believed that Russia has over 50,000 BTC worth around $5.5 billion in total.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/russia-allows-crypto-related-products-for-investors-but-with-these-limits/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T08:05:54.000Z,"Bitcoin Whales Seem to Be Calling a Top as BTC Price Consolidates","Bitcoin BTC is currently consolidating between $107,000 and $109,000, remaining just a few percentage points shy of its all-time high. While this tight range may appear stable on the surface, on-chain data suggests a shift in sentiment among some of the market's most influential participants, the large holders known as whales. Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score , a measure of accumulation behavior across various wallet-size cohorts, offers deeper insight into this evolving market dynamic. The metric evaluates the strength of purchasing by combining the size of wallet entities with the volume of bitcoin acquired over the past 15 days. For the largest holders, the value has dropped to 0.4. A reading closer to 1 indicates strong buying, whereas a level near 0 points to sales. Crucially, wallets associated with exchanges and miners are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture of investor behavior. What stands out is that entities holding 10,000 BTC or more typically classified as whales were the first to begin accumulating at the market’s April lows at around $75,000. Now, they are starting to reduce their holdings while the other wallet cohorts remain in accumulation mode. This pivot suggests a strategic shift, potentially driven by a desire to lock in profits near historic highs or a more cautious outlook on short-term price direction. Supporting evidence for this shift in behavior comes from exchange-flow data that shows whale wallets had been steadily withdrawing bitcoin over the past month, a bullish signal that implies they were not looking to sell their holdings in the short term. This trend now appears to be reversing. In two of the past three days, whales have deposited BTC back onto exchanges, a pattern commonly associated with imminent selling activity. This nuanced behavior raises the critical question: Are whales anticipating a local top?",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/29/bitcoin-whales-seem-to-be-calling-a-top-as-btc-price-consolidates,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Whale|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T08:02:08.000Z,"Arkham revealed 87.5% of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings","Arkham Intelligence extended its coverage of Strategy’s known wallets, making up to 87.5% of the holdings transparent. The posted addresses follow a recent refusal by Michael Saylor to reveal an on-chain proof of the company’s holdings. Arkham Intelligence has posted multiple wallets reportedly belonging to Strategy (MSTR). Previously, Arkham shared smaller holdings, but recently increased its efforts to track down the real on-chain portfolio of Strategy. Arkham revealed 87.5% of Strategy’s BTC holdings, including some real-time purchase transactions. | Source: Arkham Intelligence The disclosures by Arkham of the public blockchain were seen as pressure for transparency. Even Michael Saylor stated he preferred the addresses to remain confidential. There is still no consensus on the need for on-chain transparency. Security threats include dust addresses, which rely on a human mistake to transfer funds to the attacker’s wallet. Public addresses also invite transfers from small-scale projects, including prank NFT transactions . However, other BTC holdings have been transparent for years with no problems, especially the widely watched WBTC treasury. The interactions and purchase style of Strategy may also be watched and affect the market, further swaying BTC prices. Dusting wallets may also link them to mixers or exploit addresses, making it more complex for the company to prove compliance. In general, crypto transactions are still unregulated, but there are attempts to declare the origin of coins and link them to identities where possible. Strategy also relies on the announcement effect, after buying BTC at market prices, but without disclosing each purchase. The ability of anyone to notice and track the purchases in real time may erase that effect for BTC and the MSTR stock price. Strategy has also mostly accumulated BTC with no signs of selling, which could be seen as a vote of no-confidence for the leading coin. Arkham’s research reveals no purchases for days Arkham Intelligence announced all addresses hold over 454.23 BTC. The latest purchase was from five days ago, originating from Coinbase Prime. The purchases may yet be completed through other wallets, as Arkham has not exhausted the search. New wallets can also be generated, or other forms of custody. Holding BTC in third-party custody is also seen as a potential risk, as the coins are exposed to the exchange or service levels of security. Reportedly, Strategy uses mostly Coinbase Prime and Fidelity for its holdings. The Coinbase Prime funds can be segregated, but Fidelity mixes all coins and the exact share of Strategy remains uncertain. Based on Arkham’s report, Strategy holds over 327K BTC with Coinbase Prime, with up to 107K held in Fidelity wallets. On the other hand, Metaplanet has been entirely transparent with its holdings of 7,800 BTC. The Japanese company uses a self-custodial wallet to withdraw from exchanges. Other treasury holders also have known on-chain presence, with inflows from mining also reflected in their balances. Most corporate and other large-scale treasuries remain transparent, currently holding 3.37M BTC. The holdings are seen as a signal for long-term confidence and the use case of BTC as a reserve asset, especially after the addresses remain dormant with no selling. Despite the data of slower purchases, Strategy marked the success of its STRK preferred shares. The asset climbed continuously to over $102, trading at a six-month peak. MSTR common shares fell toward $364.52, as BTC moved down from its peak to the $107,000 range.

2025-05-29T08:00:19.000Z,"GameStop Diversifies With 4,710 Bitcoin—Smart Hedge Or Risky Play?","GameStop made headlines this week when it confirmed a major Bitcoin purchase. The retailer bought 4,710 BTC for about $513 million. The money came from cash raised in March through a $1.4 billion convertible notes sale. This is the first time GameStop has put crypto on its balance sheet. High Stakes Crypto Purchase According to a company statement, GameStop used part of its debt proceeds to buy Bitcoin . That $1.4 billion note sale was meant to give the company more options beyond video games and accessories. Now, almost half a billion dollars sits in crypto. It’s a bold move for a chain that’s still known for its physical stores and brick-and-mortar footprint. Share Price Swings And Investor Response Based on reports, talk of a crypto push sent GameStop’s shares higher early this year. Rumors in February drove the stock up about 18%. Then in March, when management first mentioned a possible crypto plan, shares jumped another 10%. On May 27, the stock closed at $35. In pre-market trading the next day, it was at $36.30. Over the past month, GameStop shares have risen around 28%. For the year, they are up about 11%. Retail Sales Continue To Slide GameStop’s core business hasn’t been as lucky. The latest quarter showed a 25% drop in revenue compared to the same period last year. That kind of slide makes it tough to justify a high valuation. At more than 100× trailing earnings, the company trades like a high-growth tech firm, not a retail chain with falling sales. Some investors worry that the Bitcoin play is a distraction from shoring up the basics of the store business. Debt Load Raises Concerns Using debt to buy crypto adds another layer of risk. Convertible notes can turn into shares if the stock price hits certain levels. That dilutes existing shareholders. If Bitcoin takes a dive, GameStop could face paper losses on its $513 million investment. At the same time, it still needs to manage the cost of its debt and keep the lights on in its stores. GameStop’s bet on Bitcoin shows just how far the company is willing to go to shake off its image as a fading retailer. The play could pay off if crypto keeps rallying. But it could also backfire if Bitcoin tumbles or the core business doesn’t recover. Either way, this move will be watched closely by both crypto fans and long-time GameStop customers.

2025-05-29T08:00:05.000Z,"Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead?","Amid the market’s momentary pause, Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a 2% price drop in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been hovering between key resistance and support levels, with some analysts suggesting that volatility could be in BTC’s short-term future. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For $3,000 Breakout? Analysts Say Sideways Action Is About To End Bitcoin Price Consolidates Near ATH On Wednesday, Bitcoin, alongside the rest of the crypto market, saw a small retrace ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) release of the May 6 and 7 Meeting Minutes. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped 2.7% from the $110,000 Daily Opening to a multi-day low of $107,107, suggesting a cautious approach from investors. Notably, Bitcoin has seen a significant 15% rally over the past month, hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,953 nearly a week ago, and recovering around 50% from April lows. Since reaching its new ATH, Bitcoin has moved sideways, trading between the $106,800-$109,700 levels. Despite the small retracement, analyst Crypto Jelle considers that Bitcoin’s trend into price discovery remains “intact,” pointing out that price has been consolidating above the previous highs. Per the chart, the cryptocurrency is currently forming a symmetrical triangle pattern in the lower timeframes, with the upper boundary sitting between the $109,00-$110,000 mark. To Jelle, the cryptocurrency is “building pressure for the next leg higher,” with a breakout propelling the cryptocurrency to another 30% rally. The analyst previously highlighted a Power of 3 (Po3) formation in BTC’s chart, suggesting that its price expansion targets the $140,000-$150,000 level after reclaiming the new ATH resistance. Ali Martinez stated that BTC remains “range-bound” despite today’s price drop, but added that the range’s low is the key level to watch. He warned that a breakdown below the $106,800 support could trigger increased volatility, which might send BTC’s price to lower levels. BTC Retest To Trigger Volatility? Titan of Crypto also affirmed that Bitcoin currently sits at a key level. According to the market watcher’s analysis, BTC is “still hovering around the daily Tenkan,” which is the level to watch during the potential volatility from the FOMC Minutes. A breakdown from this support zone could send the cryptocurrency’s price to the next key support at around the $102,700 mark. On the contrary, holding the current levels could set the stage for a new retest of the range’s upper boundary. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades noted that as Bitcoin consolidates near ATHs, BTC-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen significant inflows over the past few weeks, recording their second-best performance last week. As he explained, one of the cycle’s better “indicators” to determine strength or weakness at local tops or bottoms has been the ETF flows, detailing that, generally, big inflows after a big run, while BTC’s price doesn’t continue its rally, have suggested a local top. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Continue Price Discovery Rally If It Holds These Levels – Analyst To the trader, “it is important for the bulls to get that move going quickly because getting billions of inflows without proper price progress isn’t generally the best,” adding that “for the effort that’s put in and an ATH break, you’d want to see more.” Daan considers that if the massive inflows stop and BTC’s price holds, then its short-term performance will likely continue. However, if price doesn’t hold its current range, “we might need to see a bit of a flush & panic first before the proper breakout move.” As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $107,700, a 1.6% decrease in the weekly chart.

2025-05-29T07:51:57.000Z,"Norway’s K33 Raises $6.2M to Join Wave of Public Bitcoin Buyers","Key Takeaways: K33 raised $6.2 million through zero-interest loans and equity to fund Bitcoin purchases. The firm plans to use the BTC reserve to launch new financial products in the Nordic market. K33 joins a global trend of public companies turning to Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Norwegian crypto brokerage K33 is the latest firm to embrace Bitcoin as a treasury asset, raising 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) to fund its entry into the growing circle of publicly-backed BTC holders. The Oslo-based company announced on May 28 that it secured the funding through a combination of convertible loans and a new share-and-warrant issuance. The entire amount will be used to purchase Bitcoin as part of K33’s newly launched Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. K33 Secures $6.2M in Zero-Interest Loans and Equity to Fund Bitcoin Push The financing includes 45 million SEK ($4.6 million) in zero-interest convertible loans maturing in June 2028, and an additional 15 million SEK ($1.5 million) raised through equity instruments. Investors who convert their warrants before March 2026 will receive bonus warrants, potentially increasing K33’s raise to 75 million SEK ($7.7 million). CEO Bull Jenssen, writing on X, described Bitcoin as the “best-performing asset in the coming decade,” and confirmed that the company intends to “accumulate as many as possible.” He positioned the move as a proactive step, saying: “Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build your own?” At Bitcoin’s current price of around $108,000, the firm could buy approximately 57 BTC. Beyond holding, K33 plans to leverage its Bitcoin reserve to launch BTC-backed financial products, including lending services, particularly within the Nordic market. In its Q1 interim report released the same day, Jenssen emphasized the strategic value of Bitcoin beyond its potential returns. “With a sizable BTC reserve, we will be able to strengthen our financial position while unlocking new revenue streams, product capabilities, and partnerships,” he wrote.

GameStop and France’s Blockchain Group are recent examples, the latter saw its stock skyrocket over 200% in a single day following its BTC pivot in November 2024. However, K33’s own stock showed a more muted response, closing down nearly 2% on the day of the announcement. Market watchers will now be observing whether the Bitcoin bet translates into longer-term gains, both for the firm’s balance sheet and its share price. Crypto Firms Tap Capital Markets to Fuel Bitcoin Buying Spree Digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. This week, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint. Just recently, French crypto holding company Blockchain Group announced plans to purchase an additional $72 million worth of Bitcoin following a successful €63.3 million bond sale, as it expands its aggressive treasury strategy.

2025-05-29T07:49:03.000Z,"Top Bitcoin Price Predictions from Bitcoin Conference 2025: Experts Forecast $170K to $13M","The post Top Bitcoin Price Predictions from Bitcoin Conference 2025: Experts Forecast $170K to $13M appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas has just concluded. The event witnessed numerous spectacular speeches, as several prominent figures, including JD Vance (the US Vice President), Michael Saylor (the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy), Vlad Tenev (the Chairman and CEO of Robinhood), Adam Back (the CEO of Blockstream), and Paolo Ardoino (the CEO of Tether) participated in it. Historically, major Bitcoin conferences, especially those featuring high-profile speeches, can sometimes lead to increased volatility in the Bitcoin price. In the last seven days, the BTC price has experienced a drop of 3.4%. In the last 24 hours alone, the price has declined by approximately 1.2%. Experts say this price movement may reflect both post-event market corrections and ongoing macroeconomic concerns. For investors, it underscores the importance of approaching bullish predictions with caution, while still recognizing Bitcoin’s long-term potential . Interestingly, during the event, some speakers made exciting predictions about the future prospects of Bitcoin. These predictions not only demonstrate optimism but also reflect emerging shifts in how Bitcoin is being perceived at institutional and governmental levels. Here are some of those striking predictions, along with insights into their broader implications: Top Bitcoin Market Forecasters at Bitcoin Conference 2025 Donald Trump Jr. & Eric Trump Both predicted that Bitcoin could clear $170,000 by the end of 2026. Donald Jr. specifically stated that it could trade between $175,000 and $150,000 by that time. These predictions reflect a growing alignment between political figures and pro-Bitcoin narratives, possibly signaling stronger policy support ahead. Adam Back Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, reiterated his earlier forecast that Bitcoin could hit $1 million if the U.S. establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Such a move could reshape global monetary policy and offer Bitcoin a role comparable to sovereign reserves of gold. Michael Saylor The MicroStrategy co-founder is known for his long-term bullish stance. Earlier, in November, he even called on top tech companies to consider adopting his company’s aggressive Bitcoin purchase strategy . MicroStrategy is the largest public company by BTC holdings. Saylor previously forecasted that BTC could reach $13 million in the next 24 years — a prediction grounded in the idea that Bitcoin will become the primary global store of value. Arthur Hayes Arthur Hayes, the CIO of Maelstrom, repeated his prediction at the event that the Bitcoin price could hit $1 million by 2028 . His prediction is based on the expectation that the U.S. will need to significantly increase dollar liquidity, potentially devaluing fiat and boosting demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin. David Sacks David Sacks, the AI & Crypto Czar at The White House, hinted that the U.S. government may be exploring Bitcoin purchases , stating: “The Treasury and Commerce Departments are exploring budget-neutral ways to acquire Bitcoin without raising taxes or debt.” If realized, such initiatives could further legitimize Bitcoin’s role in national financial strategies. Bo Hines Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Asset at The White House, emphasized the administration’s commitment to Bitcoin. He stated that the U.S. government has no intention to sell its Bitcoin holdings and aims to accumulate more through strategic reserves — a move that could indicate Bitcoin’s integration into long-term national asset planning. Conclusion In conclusion, the Bitcoin Conference 2025 showcased bold predictions and growing institutional interest, highlighting Bitcoin’s rising role in global finance . With projections ranging from $170,000 to $13 million, influential voices suggest a bullish long-term outlook, especially amid signals of potential U.S. government involvement in strategic Bitcoin accumulation and policy support. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The 17th series of bonds, issued on May 29, comes with a face value of $525,000 each and will mature on Nov. 28, 2025. Unlike traditional debt instruments, these bonds yield no interest, allowing Metaplanet to borrow without additional repayment costs. Under the terms, Evo Fund is entitled to early redemption by giving at least five business days’ notice. The bonds can be redeemed in full or in part, in multiples of $525,000. Metaplanet may also trigger redemptions tied to future fundraising rounds involving the same investor, depending on cumulative payments. There is no collateral or guarantee attached to the bonds, and no bond administrator has been appointed, as permitted under Japanese corporate law. The company has designated its Tokyo office as the location for payment handling.

AltcoinBuzz lists ONDO (RWA), HBAR (hashgraph), SUI (L1), VIRTUAL (AI) for potential rally. These altcoins (ONDO, HBAR, SUI, VIRTUAL) show strong fundamentals & technical setups. The crypto market looks ready for another big surge, and this time, the spotlight might shift from Bitcoin (BTC) to altcoins. There are strong market signals to suggest the next big crypto rally will be the start of a full-blown altcoin season. For one, the amount of Bitcoin sitting on exchanges has kept dropping; a classic sign of a supply squeeze, which often pushes prices higher. But here’s where it gets really interesting for altcoins: Bitcoin’s dominance is slipping, and when that happens altcoins have always started rallying. While Bitcoin still has room to grow (analysts say it could even double), the real talk is around altcoins that could explode 5x, 10x, or even 20x. AltcoinBuzz has listed four altcoins that will immediately react and jump higher once altcoin season truly kicks in.

Bitcoin has gained around 60%, reaching new highs around $111K. Although it briefly bounced back below $80K during the tariff tensions, it has now climbed back above important resistance levels. Other altcoins like Ethereum and Solana have barely moved, up 10% and 9% respectively. Cardano is also up by just 12%. Clearly, XRP is running the show. Just so we are clear. Since the Trump election XRP + 350% SOL + 9% ETH + 10% BTC + 58% It is not even close… — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) May 28, 2025 XRP Oversold, A Rebound Next? XRP had been falling in price since January 17, but on May 10, it broke that downward trend. Analysts said that Bitcoin is overbought, meaning its RSI is high, often a signal that the price has gone up too fast and might pull back soon. On the other hand, XRP is oversold and its RSI is low which suggests that it is undervalued and is set for a rebound. With buyers jumping back in, XRP could be gearing up for a rally. Mid-Cap Altcoins Might Rise Again The Others/BTC ratio (total crypto market cap excluding the top 10 vs. Bitcoin) shows how well the smaller altcoins perform against BTC. A rising ratio shows that altcoins outperform, while a falling ratio indicates that Bitcoin is leading and altcoins are lagging. Currently, the ratio has hit a key support zone, and if it holds, we could see a surge in small and mid-cap altcoins. But some analysts note that altcoins have hit their weakest point against Bitcoin this entire cycle, and the lowest weekly close since 2021 and a comeback may be far off. 10x Research shared that altcoins are struggling as Bitcoin races past $111,000 on strong ETF and institutional demand. While AAVE and Hyperliquid soared with gains of 13% and 42%, many altcoins like Trump Token, SUI, DOGE, ADA, and LINK faced sharp declines. XRP saw a brief spike but remains weak. Solana and BNB showed mixed results.

However, economist and long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff swiftly challenged these claims, arguing that no real wealth was created at all. No Real Wealth Created, Says Schiff Schiff on X highlighted his strong displeasure with the government’s crypto stance. He stated that Bitcoin did not generate wealth but instead facilitated a large transfer of wealth, from early adopters to latecomers. “What has happened is a massive transfer of wealth,” he wrote, warning that capital has been misallocated and valuable resources wasted in the process. At Bitcoin 2025, JD Vance spoke about all the wealth created by Bitcoin and crypto. No actual wealth was created, as these tokens do not represent wealth. What has happened is a massive transfer of wealth from those who bought Bitcoin and crypto early to those who bought later.… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 28, 2025 Criticism of Government Policy Meanwhile, Schiff also took a jab at the Trump administration, which Vance represents. He said rather than promoting Bitcoin as a backup plan for bad policies, leaders like Vance and Trump should focus on fixing those policies in the first place. According to him, good governance would reduce inflation and the need for any hedge at all. A Bit of Humor from Schiff… PETER SCHIFF: Based on what I heard at #Bitcoin 2025 “I'm likely responsible for more people owning Bitcoin than any other individual.” “Every time I tell you not to buy Bitcoin you buy more.” pic.twitter.com/zrxC6AQcZ5 — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 Interestingly, Schiff was also a participant at the same conference and shared a humorous observation during a fireside chat. “I’m likely responsible for more people owning Bitcoin than any other individual,” he joked, adding, “Every time I tell you not to buy Bitcoin, you buy more.” Despite his opposition, Schiff acknowledged his role in indirectly promoting Bitcoin through criticism. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : James Howells Hasn’t Given Up: A New $75M Plan to Rescue His Lost Bitcoin , Gold vs Bitcoin He went further, dismissing Vance’s statement that Bitcoin serves as a hedge against inflation and poor government policy. According to Schiff, Americans want real protection, they should stick to gold and silver assets that have stood the test of time. He added that Bitcoin doesn’t offer the kind of safety people are hoping for in tough economic times. Vance, on the other hand, had framed Bitcoin as a transformative financial tool and even a strategic asset that could strengthen the U.S.’s global economic leadership. His bullish stance highlighted the growing political interest in digital assets , while Schiff’s remarks brought in a starkly contrasting traditional perspective. Crypto Reaction In response to Schiff, one crypto user, Metabolic Uncle explained that producing Bitcoin costs more relative to its market price than gold does, averaging 63% of its value in major cities. This means Bitcoin carries more real-world input like energy and hardware, giving it a stronger intrinsic value compared to gold. At the time of the debate, Bitcoin was trading at around $108,237, slightly down on the day, but still reflecting strong market interest. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The pseudonymous trader known as Dave the Wave tells his 153,800 followers on the social media platform X that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator suggests Bitcoin’s uptrend may continue. The MACD is used to determine the direction, momentum and duration of a trend or to identify potential buy and sell signals. “Longer-term monthly BTC MACD turning upward again.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at his monthly chart, the MACD histogram was starting to weaken after surging, but has just begun to trend upward again. Dave the Wave also says that BTC may soar to $160,000 in just a couple of months, a more than 47% increase from its current value. “The BTC microcosm of the macro.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Bitcoin is trading in the middle of a range with a lower bound of $75,000 and an upper bound of $160,000. Lastly, he says that if Bitcoin remains in the bullish trend, a market correction could see the flagship crypto asset retest $100,000 as support, stopping short of a more severe decline. “If the fractal held, a very weak partial right shoulder would form, not a full one – $100,000, not $90,000.” Bitcoin is trading for $108,832 at time of writing, down 1.4% in the last 24 hours.

Discover how this AI-powered crypto is shaking up the crypto sector. Table of Contents Expert predicts ETH surge to $4,000 amid bullish signals Cardano forming symmetrical triangle How Unilabs is reimagining passive crypto income Unilabs rises as the leading DeFi project in the market The Ethereum price is expected to push toward the $4,000 mark in the coming days based on bullish technical indicators. Besides, AshCryptoReal noted that a second doji candlestick has formed on the chart, pointing at an uptrend. While ETH eyes a rally, Cardano holders are shifting to a new project because of its potential. Meet Unilabs, the AI-powered platform that is expected to transform the $120 billion DeFi market. Expert predicts ETH surge to $4,000 amid bullish signals The Ethereum price ( ETH ) may be on the verge of a major rally, according to crypto expert AshCryptoReal, who boldly declared on X, “SEND $ETH TO $4,000.” Backing his prediction with technical indicators, AshCryptoReal points out that the appearance of a second consecutive doji candle suggests that the uptrend has the potential to continue. Some key factors are aligning to support a move toward the $4,000 level within the next 4–6 weeks. The RSI and MACD signal renewed strength in the Ethereum price momentum. AshCryptoReal has pointed to Bitcoin’s performance as the most pivotal catalyst. If Bitcoin breaks its ATH, it could set off a wave of bullish sentiment that lifts all major altcoins, including the Ethereum price. Coupled with macroeconomic factors, ETH may surpass the $4,000 mark. ETH has profits of 38.3% on the monthly chart. Cardano forming symmetrical triangle The Cardano price ( ADA ) is still trading below the $1 mark despite the little uptick on the weekly chart. According to CoinMarketCap, ADA rose by 3.3% over seven days and currently hovers between $0.72 and $0.77. Looking ahead, Sssebi expects Cardano to skyrocket to $0.84 and even $1. According to them, the cryptocurrency is currently forming a symmetrical triangle with a potential breakout in the near term. In addition, Leader Alpha believes ADA shows one of the biggest bull flags. According to analysts, ADA is likely to jump over a major trend resistance in mid-June. When this happens, Leader Alpha believes ADA might form a big God candle which may push it up the chart. Investor confidence has risen to 71%, making it more likely that a Cardano ETF gets approval. An approval could push Cardano’s price to a record high.

This project is a passive income-generating opportunity for users who want to capitalize on the $120 billion DeFi market. Simply put, Unilabs is a DeFi project for those who want to participate in the best crypto investments without being glued to price charts and market trends. At the core of its offering is a set of four AI-optimized investment funds (AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund) each tailored to different risk appetites. Meanwhile, Unilabs has a unified yield engine, which redistributes profits from all strategies into a shared profit pool, allowing users to benefit across market verticals and not just one. Unlike top DeFi projects that rely solely on staking, Unilabs offers “multi-source yield,” a combination of arbitrage profits, staking rewards, mining returns, and algorithmic fund rebalancing. This blend mimics hedge fund logic, now made accessible to everyday users via one token: UNIL. Currently in the crypto ICO stage and trading at $0.0051, with over $1.27 million raised, the platform is drawing attention. If Unilabs reaches a $75 million market cap, the DeFi token could hit $0.025, offering early buyers a 5x return. With 30% of all fees redistributed and AI doing the heavy lifting, Unilabs could be the next income machine for the future. Unilabs rises as the leading DeFi project in the market As ETH builds momentum, Cardano holders are diversifying to new DeFi projects that offer more utility and earning opportunities. Unilabs is one of the fastest-growing crypto ICOs in the market and has the potential to outshine even top altcoins like ADA. Those who want to benefit from this new revolution have to join the presale early before it launches. To learn more about UNIL, visit the website and Telegram.

With fresh tech, strong on-chain activity, and bullish sentiment building, the stage is set. The question now is simple: can ADA hit the fabled $1 mark before June ends? Let’s find out. Inside Cardano’s Latest Progress Cardano’s been busy. It’s now in its Voltaire governance phase, where decisions about upgrades, spending, and protocol changes are now on-chain, made by ADA holders. Founder Charles Hoskinson also recently stated that Cardano could be the first blockchain to launch a privacy stablecoin. That comes alongside a recent integration with Brave Browser. There’s more on the way too. The upcoming Leios upgrade, due sometime over the next year, is set to boost Cardano’s transactions per second to 11,000 and improve how developers create programmable currencies. Cardano is now expanding into Bitcoin territory, with the Lace wallet adding Bitcoin support to open up cross-chain DeFi options. Source: TapTools This tech progress is matched by a surge in activity. According to TapTools , daily transactions jumped to 50,000 in May, and developers logged 21,258 GitHub commits, putting Cardano ahead of Ethereum this year. It’s clear Cardano’s steady approach is paying off, with the token now up over 65% in the past year, at $0.76 as of May 28th . So do Cardano price predictions think it can reach $1 before June? Cardano Price Prediction: $1 Is In Sight ADA has recently recovered after pulling back from its March highs of around $1.14. A sharp tumble in April sent the token to $0.52, and after topping $0.84 in mid-May, it’s now bouncing between $0.72 and $0.83. In late May, it’s been finding resistance at the $0.77 mark, with $0.80 now the next key level to challenge. It’s held firm, and a breakout could be around the corner. If ADA clears $0.80, analysts are watching $0.85 as the next key level. Get past that, and it’s likely to quickly head toward $0.90 or possibly $1.00 according to CoinDCX , especially if market sentiment stays positive. But $1.00 before June seems unlikely without a significant catalyst. Still, Cardano price predictions for June are positive. If bulls stay in charge, ADA could close June around $1.10–$1.30. That’s not guaranteed, but it’s not out of reach either. The volume’s there, and ADA has held up well, trending higher since its April low. For now, the price action is coiling. The setup’s strong and ADA only needs a spark to explode. Keep an eye on that $0.80 level: that’s where things could get interesting. Remittix steps Up With a $15.4+ Million Raise Cardano looks bullish, but that hasn’t stopped investors from diversifying into the Remittix presale. Remittix is developing a new way to turn crypto into real-world money fast.

At $0.0781 right now, the RTX token is one to watch carefully. Watch Out for ADA and RTX ADA’s momentum is building, and all eyes are on the $1 mark. While it might not be reached by the start of June, it’s a viable target in the month ahead. Meanwhile, Remittix looks strong.

2025-05-29T06:40:23.000Z,"Dogecoin ETF: 21Shares Files Historic Application for Spot Crypto Investment","BitcoinWorld Dogecoin ETF: 21Shares Files Historic Application for Spot Crypto Investment Get ready, crypto enthusiasts! The world of digital assets just got another interesting development that could potentially shake things up, especially for fans of the popular meme coin. According to a report by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared on X, 21Shares , a well-known player in the crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) space, has officially filed an application to launch a spot Dogecoin ETF in the United States. This move is a significant signal of the continued interest in expanding Crypto Investment products into mainstream financial markets. Understanding the Buzz: What is a Spot Dogecoin ETF? Before we dive deeper into why this filing is making waves, let’s quickly clarify what a spot ETF is, especially in the context of cryptocurrency. Think of an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) like a basket of assets you can buy and sell on traditional stock exchanges. A Spot Crypto ETF , specifically, holds the actual underlying cryptocurrency – in this case, Dogecoin – directly. This is different from a futures ETF, which holds contracts speculating on the future price of the asset, not the asset itself. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Spot Dogecoin ETF Dogecoin Futures ETF Underlying Asset Actual Dogecoin (DOGE) Contracts speculating on Dogecoin’s future price Price Tracking Aims to track the current market price of Dogecoin closely May deviate from the spot price due to futures market dynamics Investor Exposure Direct exposure to Dogecoin’s current price movements Indirect exposure via derivatives Custody The ETF provider holds the actual Dogecoin securely Holds futures contracts, no direct Dogecoin custody needed by the fund The key takeaway is that a spot Dogecoin ETF would offer investors a way to gain exposure to the direct price movements of Dogecoin without needing to buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. This is particularly appealing to traditional investors who are more comfortable with brokerage accounts and regulated financial products. Who is 21Shares and Why Does Their Filing Matter? 21Shares is not new to the world of crypto investment products. They are actually one of the largest issuers of crypto ETPs globally, with a range of products tracking various cryptocurrencies available on European exchanges. Their experience in creating and managing regulated crypto financial products lends significant weight to their application for a Dogecoin ETF in the potentially lucrative, but often challenging, U.S. market. Their filing isn’t just another application; it’s a strategic move from a prominent player. Having successfully launched numerous crypto ETPs in other jurisdictions, 21Shares brings expertise in compliance, custody, and product structuring that is crucial for navigating the stringent requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing signals their confidence not only in the future of Crypto Investment but specifically in the potential for Dogecoin as an investable asset class for a broader audience. The Journey Towards a Spot Crypto ETF in the U.S. The path to getting a Spot Crypto ETF approved in the United States has been a long and winding one. For years, the SEC had expressed concerns primarily related to market manipulation and investor protection in the underlying spot crypto markets. However, the landscape shifted dramatically with the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs set a precedent. It demonstrated that the SEC is now seemingly more comfortable with the structure and surveillance mechanisms proposed by issuers for spot crypto products. This paved the way for applications for other cryptocurrencies. While Ethereum spot ETFs are currently undergoing the review process, 21Shares’ move to file for a Dogecoin ETF shows that issuers are now looking beyond the top two cryptocurrencies, indicating growing maturity and acceptance of the broader digital asset class within traditional finance. Why a Dogecoin ETF? Exploring the Rationale Some might find it surprising that a meme coin like Dogecoin is now the subject of a spot ETF filing by a major issuer like 21Shares . However, Dogecoin has a few unique characteristics that make it a candidate, albeit a controversial one, for such a product: Brand Recognition: Dogecoin has massive brand recognition, largely due to its community and high-profile endorsements (like Elon Musk). This makes it instantly recognizable to potential investors. Liquidity: Despite its origins, Dogecoin is one of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, traded on numerous exchanges globally. Liquidity is a key factor for ETF products. Market Cap: Dogecoin consistently ranks among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, indicating significant investor interest and market presence. While its fundamentals differ significantly from Bitcoin or Ethereum, its popularity and market presence make it a potential target for products aimed at capturing retail investor interest within a regulated framework. This filing is a bet by 21Shares on the enduring appeal and market viability of Dogecoin as part of the expanding universe of Crypto Investment options. What Could a Spot Dogecoin ETF Mean for Dogecoin Price and Investors? The potential approval of a Dogecoin ETF could have several significant implications, particularly for the Dogecoin Price and how people access this asset. Potential Benefits: Increased Accessibility: Millions of investors who prefer using traditional brokerage accounts could easily add Dogecoin exposure to their portfolios without dealing with crypto exchanges, wallets, or private keys. Enhanced Legitimacy: An SEC-approved ETF could lend an air of legitimacy to Dogecoin as an asset class, potentially attracting more conservative investors. Potential Demand Increase: If an ETF is approved and gains traction, the issuer would need to buy actual Dogecoin on the spot market to back the fund’s shares. This consistent buying pressure could positively impact the Dogecoin Price . Professional Custody: The ETF would handle the secure storage of the underlying Dogecoin, removing a significant hurdle and risk for individual investors. Potential Challenges and Risks: Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, approval for altcoins like Dogecoin is not guaranteed. The SEC might have specific concerns related to Dogecoin’s concentration, market structure, or meme-driven volatility. Market Volatility: Dogecoin is known for its extreme price swings. An ETF would not cushion investors from this inherent volatility; they would still be exposed to significant potential losses. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which would be an ongoing cost for investors compared to holding Dogecoin directly. Dilution of Direct Ownership: Investing via an ETF means owning shares in a fund that owns Dogecoin, not owning the Dogecoin directly. This means you cannot use the Dogecoin for transactions, staking (if applicable in the future), or other on-chain activities. The impact on Dogecoin Price is a subject of much speculation. While increased demand from an ETF could be bullish, the overall market sentiment, regulatory hurdles, and Dogecoin’s own supply dynamics will also play crucial roles. It’s essential for investors to consider these factors carefully. Broader Implications for the Spot Crypto ETF and Crypto Investment Landscape The 21Shares filing for a Dogecoin ETF is more than just a story about a single meme coin; it’s indicative of a larger trend in the financial world. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has clearly emboldened issuers to explore offering similar products for a wider range of digital assets. This signals a maturing Spot Crypto ETF market and a growing appetite from traditional finance to package and sell crypto exposure to a broader investor base. This development could potentially pave the way for ETFs tracking other altcoins in the future, assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared and sufficient market interest exists. It represents a significant step in the convergence of traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem, making Crypto Investment more accessible, albeit through different avenues than direct ownership. Expert Insights on the Dogecoin ETF Filing As mentioned by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this filing is a notable event. Analysts are closely watching how the SEC will approach altcoin spot ETF applications following the Bitcoin approvals. The unique nature of Dogecoin might present specific challenges or require different considerations from regulators compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. The filing itself, however, confirms that major financial product issuers see potential demand for a wide array of Crypto Investment vehicles. What’s Next for the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF Application? Now that the application is filed, it will undergo a review process by the SEC. This process can take several months, involving periods for public comment, potential amendments to the filing, and ultimately, a decision to approve, deny, or delay. There is no guarantee of approval, and the outcome will likely depend on how well 21Shares addresses the SEC’s concerns, particularly those specific to the Dogecoin market. Conclusion: A New Era for Dogecoin and Spot Crypto ETFs? The filing by 21Shares for a spot Dogecoin ETF marks a significant moment in the evolution of Crypto Investment products. It highlights the increasing institutional interest in bringing digital assets, even those that started as internet jokes, into regulated financial frameworks. While the approval is far from certain, the filing itself validates Dogecoin’s enduring market presence and signals a potential expansion of the Spot Crypto ETF market beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Whether this leads to increased adoption and positively impacts the Dogecoin Price remains to be seen, but it undeniably opens up a new avenue for traditional investors to potentially gain exposure to the world of meme coins.

2025-05-29T06:38:30.000Z,"Pakistan confirms plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve","Pakistan will create a strategic Bitcoin reserve as part of a government-led initiative to embrace digital assets. During his appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the newly established Pakistan Crypto Council, said the government is setting up a national Bitcoin wallet to hold reserves long term. He clarified that the initiative is not driven by market speculation but by a broader state strategy, adding that the government will “never, ever sell” the Bitcoin it acquires. Pakistan’s decision marks a clear break from past skepticism . Saqib said the move was directly inspired by the United States’ decision to establish its own Bitcoin reserve, noting that Pakistan intends to follow a similar path in embracing blockchain-based financial infrastructure. While the size of Pakistan’s intended Bitcoin holdings remains unspecified, the government has made clear its intent to acquire and retain the asset. It is still unclear whether the BTC will be purchased directly or obtained through other channels. The announcement comes alongside a broader push to integrate blockchain technologies into the country’s public and economic systems. You might also like: Texas approves Bitcoin reserve bill, awaits governor’s signature Saqib also confirmed plans to allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity toward Bitcoin mining operations and AI data centers, an initiative intended to generate revenue, create jobs, and attract foreign investment. Officials view this as a productive use of otherwise stranded energy and a path to modernize the power sector. As previously reported by crypto.news, Pakistan recently disclosed plans to establish the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), a regulatory body approved by the Ministry of Finance to oversee the country’s digital asset sector. The PDAA would be tasked with licensing and monitoring crypto exchanges, custodians, tokenization platforms, and related services, forming the backbone of Pakistan’s digital finance strategy. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has described the agency as central to placing Pakistan “at the forefront of financial innovation.” Beyond market oversight, the PDAA will also explore tokenizing state assets, enabling blockchain-based debt issuance, and guiding the development of decentralized finance infrastructure. Saqib’s Pakistan Crypto Council has been closely involved in shaping these reforms. Established earlier this year, the Council has engaged with international stakeholders , including Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who now serves as a strategic advisor on blockchain infrastructure and regulatory development.

CEO Michael Saylor previously declined to reveal the company’s address for security reasons. According to a recent post from the blockchain analytics firm, it has identified what is allegedly an address containing the Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings of Michael Saylor’s software company. The tracking page set up on Arkham’s platform for the address shows that it holds around 454,231 BTC. At current market prices, its holdings are valued at $48.8 billion, with each BTC trading at $107,619. The address does not hold any other digital asset aside from Bitcoin. Not only that, Arkham later claimed that it has identified an additional 70,816 BTC on-chain that it traced back to Strategy , valued at $7.6 billion.

Traders on X reacted negatively to Arkham publicly revealing Strategy’s alleged crypto address. Many of them called out the analytics platform for not respecting Saylor’s wishes and making the information available for social engineering hackers to exploit. “If Saylor doesn’t want it revealed, and u reveal isn’t that violation of privacy,” said one user. “You literally missed the ENTIRE point of his reply. This means nothing,” wrote another user. “Did Arkham seriously just publicly dox and violate privacy? Which is the whole point of Bitcoin. Privacy,” argued another X user. Hailed as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, Strategy claims to hold 580,250 BTC which is valued at $62.4 billion based on current market prices. The company recently purchased 4,020 BTC at a price of $427.1 million on May 26. Most recently on May 27, Saylor refused to disclose Strategy’s on-chain addresses. He believed that revealing them to the public would pose a security risk, as it simultaneously jeopardizes various stakeholders: the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges, and the investors. “It’s like publishing the address and the bank accounts of all your kids and [the] phone numbers of all your kids and then thinking somehow that makes your family better,” said Saylor.

This move was recorded as the largest land registry tokenization project in the United States. Under a five-year agreement between Bergen County and blockchain-based land registry firm Balcony, 370,000 land records will be stored on the Avalanche network, immutable and searchable, serving a population of about 1 million people spread across 70 municipalities just across New York City.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Adams pledged to advocate for and support the creation of municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin ( BTC ). “We have financial instruments for all other bonds. You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said. “I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.” New York City Mayor Eric Adams wants a Bitcoin bond and to axe the State BitLicense program. BitSource: YouTube Adams didn’t share details about how a Bitbond would work; however, a March 31 policy brief paper from advocacy group the Bitcoin Policy Institute proposed a model where holders receive an annual interest rate of 1% for 10 years. When the bond matures, holders also receive a percentage of any Bitcoin market gains . At the same time, 90% of the funds raised through the bonds are allocated to government spending, while 10% is used to purchase Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s bond policy brief. Adams again pushes to axe BitLicense Adams also called for repealing New York’s BitLicense program, which the state launched in 2015 and requires crypto businesses to apply for a license with the New York Department of Financial Services and meet strict compliance standards. The BitLicense program has received criticism from the industry , and Adams has also said the measure is too costly with high licensing fees, and is too stringent with its Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures. “You have a mayor who is the crypto mayor, is the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the city of New York, where you won’t be attacked and criminalized,” he said. “Let’s get rid of the Bitcoin license and allow us to have the free flow of Bitcoin in our city.” Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summit USDC stablecoin issuer Circle was one of the first crypto companies to receive a BitLicense; others have since followed, including crypto exchange Coinbase and trading firm Bakkt. Adams has been actively pushing to attract crypto firms to New York City.

2025-05-29T06:09:53.000Z,"Bitcoin's $95K-$105K Range in Focus as $10B BTC Options Expiry Looms","Bitcoin BTC options worth billions of dollars are set to expire this Friday at 08:00 UTC on Deribit, making the $95,000 to $105,000 range a critical zone for potential volatility and directional cues. At press time, a total of 93,131 bitcoin monthly options contracts, worth over $10 billion, were due for settlement, with 53% being calls and the remainder being puts. A call option represents a bullish bet on the market, while the put option offers insurance against price slides. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC. The open interest distribution is such that a large amount of \""delta\"" exposure is clustered at the $95,000, $100,000 and $105,000 strikes. This means traders holding positions at these strikes have a significant net directional risk to bitcoin's price. Gamma, which measures the sensitivity of options to changes in BTC's price, will peak as the expiration nears. Therefore, price volatility could trigger widespread hedging by both investors and market makers (who are always on the opposite side of investors' trades), further exacerbating price turbulence. \""The largest delta concentration is in Deribit BTC’s May 30 expiry, with $2.8B delta exposure led by strikes at $100K, $105K, and $95K, which has a potential for strong gamma-driven flows into month-end,\"" decentralized crypto trading platform Volmex said in an explainer on X. \""Any move can trigger aggressive dealer hedging, fragile gamma environment! Expect volatility!,\"" Volmex added. At press time, Bitcoin changed hands at $107,700, having reached record highs above $111,000 the previous week, according to CoinDesk data. Deribit's DVOL index, which represents the options-based 30-day implied or expected volatility, continued to decline, suggesting minimal concern over volatility driven by the upcoming expiry. Volmex's annualized one-day implied volatility index ticked slightly higher to 45.4%.

2025-05-29T06:07:12.000Z,"Bitcoin $120K ‘epic mic drop’ rally set after US court blocks Trump tariffs","Bitcoin is poised to rally toward $120,000 after a US federal court blocked the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, a crypto analyst says. “The trade court decision was an epic mic drop, and it’s going to intensify momentum behind Bitcoin,” Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph. The US Court of International Trade reportedly blocked Trump from imposing his tariffs on May 28, arguing that he overstepped his authority. Court “blows a hole in trade talks” Hundal said the decision would have a domino effect on Bitcoin’s price and believes “new all-time highs are imminent, and the momentum is largely irreversible at this stage.” Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) current all-time high of $111,970 was reached on May 22, but it has since fallen to trade around $107,750, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is down 3.36% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap The Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed. “It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.” On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers , levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10% . Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified. “The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, rally — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said , “Buy everything round dos.” Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrow Crypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said , “So Trump tariffs are illegal? Does that mean we get green candles all around tomorrow?” Hundal said “a wall of money” is coming into Bitcoin through corporations, spot Bitcoin ETFs and retail. The trading week ending May 23 saw US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) record a total of $2.75 billion in inflows . Related: Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible “The court order has just accelerated that rotation into risk assets across the US and Asia,” Hundal said. He added all data signals “a solid floor for demand on spot Bitcoin and a very solid consensus for $120K in the option markets.” Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered , recently said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

K33 could purchase up to 57 Bitcoin (BTC) at BTC’s current price of just over $108,000. Source: K33K33 CEO Bull Jenssen posted to X on May 28 that he thinks Bitcoin will be the “best-performing asset in the coming decade,” and his company will “accumulate as many as possible while unlocking powerful operational synergies with our brokerage operation.”“Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build you own? Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028. The remaining 15 million Swedish krona ($1.5 million) will come through a new share issuance and warrants, according to K33. If investors convert their warrants before March 2026, they are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share.

Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin’s failure to maintain above the $109,588 level may have attracted selling by short-term traders. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000 and later to the pattern target of $3,153.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($2,467). The failure of a bullish setup may trap the aggressive bulls, sinking the pair to $2,323 and below that to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been trading between the moving averages, indicating a lack of aggressive buying or selling.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($2.33) and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price dips below the 50-day SMA ($2.24), the XRP/USDT pair could dive to the $2 support. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61.On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA opens the gates for a rally to $2.65. Buyers will have to drive the pair above $2.65 to catapult the price to $3.BNB price predictionBuyers pushed BNB (BNB) above the $693 resistance on May 27 but could not sustain the higher levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe price action of the past few days has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $693. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could rally toward the pattern target of $752.The 20-day EMA ($658) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could accelerate selling as the aggressive bulls may cover their positions. That could tug the pair to the 50-day SMA ($622).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) has been consolidating inside a narrow range between the 20-day EMA ($169) and the overhead resistance at $180.SOL/USDT daily chart.

The SOL/USDT pair could descend to $159 and later to the 50-day SMA ($153), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the pair could swing between $153 and $180 for some time.A break and close above $180 signals the resumption of the up move. The pair could pick up momentum and rally to the $210 to $220 resistance zone.Dogecoin price predictionSellers are trying to pull Dogecoin (DOGE) below the immediate support at the 20-day EMA ($0.22).DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the horizontal support at $0.21.

Such a move brings the large $0.14 to $0.26 range into play.On the contrary, a rebound off $0.21 suggests the bulls are vigorously defending the level. That could keep the pair inside the $0.21 to $0.26 range for a few more days.Cardano price predictionBuyers have managed to keep Cardano (ADA) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern, but the bounce lacks strength.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThat increases the risk of a break below the 50-day SMA ($0.70). If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to the solid support at $0.60.

If they can pull it off, the pair may rally to the $3.90 to $4.25 overhead zone.On the other hand, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests that the bears remain in control.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($15.66) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech.

My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
