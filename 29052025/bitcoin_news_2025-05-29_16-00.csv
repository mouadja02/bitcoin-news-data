2025-05-29T13:51:19.000Z,"Price Prediction For Ripple (XRP) and New Trending Cryptocurrency: $5, $10, or $15?","The post Price Prediction For Ripple (XRP) and New Trending Cryptocurrency: $5, $10, or $15? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Price prediction for XRP and new cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , are sparking excitement in the crypto market. After many months of holding steady, XRP has begun to show signs that it may be rising. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining interest because its Phase 5 presale is running, with tokens selling for a price of $0.03. People are looking at both these industries for big returns in 2025. XRP’s technical patterns suggest a breakout, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a guaranteed 100% ROI at its $0.06 launch price. With $9,400,000 raised and over 515 million tokens sold to 11,300 holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction. But what is their potential to hit $5, $10, or $15? XRP’s Bullish Surge XRP is flashing promising signals for investors. A Golden Cross on its weekly RSI indicates strong upward momentum. This rare pattern, unseen for years, suggests XRP could break past $3.33 soon. Analysts see short-term targets at $2.68, $2.95, and $3.39. Some even predict a climb to $5.85 in 2025. XRP’s market cap has grown 2% this quarter, outpacing declines in other crypto coins like Bitcoin. Daily active wallets have surged 142%, and new addresses are up 210%. These metrics signal robust adoption. However, crypto prices face resistance at $2.30. A drop below could push XRP to $2.10, testing investor confidence. Still, XRP’s momentum is undeniable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor interest in Phase 5 of its presale. Priced at $0.03, the token has risen 200% from its opening phase at $0.01. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. At launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will list at $0.06, ensuring a 100% ROI for current buyers. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $3, offering a 9,900% return. The project has raised $9,400,000, with 515 million tokens sold to 11,300 holders. This demand underscores Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal in the crypto investment space. The team recently launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks, adding further incentive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining crypto lending with a dual-model system. Its Peer-to-Contract approach lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools for passive income. Because these interest rates can be changed automatically, both lenders and borrowers are better off. Peer-to-Peer encourages one user to lend to another, increasing both openness and control for users. Since Mutuum Finance is on Ethereum, the MUTM stablecoin is always worth $1. In addition, using Layer-2 technology allows for cheaper and quicker transactions which many users see as crypto investment pain points. Unlike other crypto coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches its beta platform at listing, enabling immediate user access. This utility-driven approach positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a standout in the crypto market. Security and Transparency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing trust through robust security. The team recently completed a Certik audit, earning a 70.00 security score. No vulnerabilities were found in the smart contract, and no security incidents occurred in the past 90 days. This transparency reassures investors eyeing crypto prices today. XRP, while established, lacks the fresh utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers. The latter’s focus on scalable DeFi solutions gives it an edge. As crypto investing grows, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s audited infrastructure and clear roadmap make it a compelling choice for those seeking the best crypto to invest in. Weighing Future Gains Price prediction for XRP and new cryptocurrency like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hinges on distinct strengths. XRP’s technical breakout and growing adoption suggest it could hit $5 or beyond in 2025. However, its volatility requires caution, with support levels critical to watch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.03 in Phase 5, offers a clearer path to gains. Its 100% ROI at launch and potential $3 post-launch target make it a top crypto to buy now. Both assets hold promise, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s innovative lending model and early-stage pricing appeal to those seeking high returns. Stay informed and consider joining Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale to secure your position in this dynamic crypto market.

2025-05-29T13:50:55.000Z,"Metaplanet Issues $21M in Zero-Interest Bonds to Fuel Bitcoin Accumulation","Metaplanet has issued $21 million worth of zero-interest bonds to Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment company, intensifying its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The issuance, announced on May 29, came just a day after the company revealed a separate $50 million capital raise, signaling the company’s commitment to becoming one of the world’s largest corporate BTC holders. The new bonds, classified as the 17th series, carry a face value of $525,000 each and mature on November 28, 2025. Unlike typical debt instruments, these bonds carry no interest, allowing Metaplanet to raise capital without incurring additional repayment costs. Evo Fund has the right to early redemption with at least five business days’ notice, and redemptions can be made in full or in multiples of $525,000. Metaplanet may also initiate early redemptions under specific conditions, particularly if future fundraising rounds involve the same investor. As per Japanese corporate law, no collateral or bond administrator is required for this issuance, and payments will be handled from the firm’s Tokyo office. Bitcoin Ambitions Intensify with $135M Raised in 2024 The $21 million raise adds to a rapidly growing pool of capital Metaplanet is deploying toward Bitcoin. Since the start of the year, the company has raised a total of $135.2 million through various bond sales—$25.9 million in February, $13.3 million in March, and $25 million earlier in May. Metaplanet now holds approximately 7,800 BTC , according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, making it the 11th-largest corporate holder globally. Its current BTC holdings are valued around $840 million, with an average purchase price of $91,340 per BTC. The firm aims to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, a goal it is fast approaching with consistent capital injections and strategic purchases. In March, the company secured 696 BTC through exercised cash-secured put options, supplemented by premiums earned from selling contracts. This was followed by another purchase of 145 BTC for $13.6 million in late April. Expanding to the U.S. and Gaining Political Attention On May 1, the company announced it will launch a U.S.-based subsidiary, Metaplanet Treasury, headquartered in Florida. This new entity plans to raise up to $250 million, giving the company access to U.S. capital markets and enabling further Bitcoin purchases. Adding to its high-profile strategy, Eric Trump, son of the U.S. President Donald Trump, joined Metaplanet’s Strategic Advisory Board in March . The broader trend of corporate BTC adoption is gaining momentum as well—on May 28, GameStop confirmed its own entry into the Bitcoin space with a 4,710 BTC investment.

2025-05-29T13:50:52.000Z,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar: U.S. Spot ETH ETFs See Impressive $84.9M Boost","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar: U.S. Spot ETH ETFs See Impressive $84.9M Boost The world of cryptocurrency investments is constantly buzzing, and recent data on U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs has certainly grabbed attention. If you’re following the institutional adoption of digital assets, this is a development you won’t want to miss. Why Are Ethereum ETF Inflows Significant? Understanding the flow of capital into investment vehicles like ETFs provides valuable insight into market sentiment and institutional interest. On May 28, Ethereum ETF inflows in the U.S. reached a notable milestone, seeing a combined net inflow of $84.9 million. This wasn’t just a one-off event; it marked the eighth consecutive trading day experiencing positive net inflows, according to data tracked by Farside Investors. Consecutive days of inflows suggest sustained interest rather than a single large purchase, indicating growing confidence or strategic positioning by investors utilizing these new products. Breaking Down the ETH ETF Investment While the total figure is impressive, looking at which specific ETH ETF products attracted the most capital gives a clearer picture of investor preference. Here’s how the $84.9 million was distributed among the leading funds on May 28: BlackRock ETH ETF (ETHA): Led the pack with substantial net inflows of $52.7 million. BlackRock’s entry into the crypto ETF space, following its success with Bitcoin, continues to be a major market factor. Fidelity (FETH): Followed closely, attracting $25.7 million in net inflows. Fidelity is another financial giant making significant strides in offering crypto investment products. Grayscale’s mini ETH (ETCG): Saw $4.9 million in net inflows. This newer, lower-fee version of Grayscale’s trust product appears to be gaining traction. Invesco (QETH): Recorded $1.6 million in net inflows. Other U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs tracked reported no change in their holdings for the day, meaning their inflows and outflows netted out to zero. What Does This Mean for Crypto ETFs and Ethereum? The consistent positive flow into Crypto ETFs , particularly those tracking Ethereum, highlights a few key potential takeaways: Growing Institutional Comfort: The significant amounts flowing into products from major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity suggest that large institutions and sophisticated investors are actively using these regulated pathways to gain exposure to Ethereum. Post-Approval Momentum: These inflows occur shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key regulatory filings (19b-4 forms) for several spot Ethereum ETFs. While trading hasn’t begun yet (requiring S-1 form approval), the approval itself seems to have spurred pre-emptive positioning or increased confidence in the asset class. Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: Following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, investors now have a similar, accessible way to invest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, potentially driving diversification within crypto portfolios. Market Impact: While ETF inflows are only one factor, sustained buying pressure through these vehicles can potentially influence the price dynamics of Ethereum on exchanges. Are U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs Right for You? For traditional investors or institutions hesitant about buying and storing actual cryptocurrency, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs offer a regulated and familiar investment structure. They allow exposure to ETH price movements without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges directly. However, it’s important to remember that all investments carry risk, and the value of cryptocurrency can be highly volatile. Potential investors should conduct thorough research and consider their own financial situation and risk tolerance before investing in any ETF, including those focused on digital assets like Ethereum. In Summary: A Positive Trend for ETH ETFs The data from May 28, showing $84.9 million in net inflows and marking the eighth consecutive day of positive flow, underscores increasing investor interest in ETH ETF products. With BlackRock and Fidelity leading the charge, these inflows signal a maturing market and growing institutional comfort with Ethereum as an investment asset accessed through regulated financial products. As the market awaits the final S-1 approvals for trading to commence, these early inflow figures provide a compelling glimpse into the potential demand for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs.

2025-05-29T13:49:23.000Z,"Trump Media & Technology: 'Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' Growth Likely A Distant Dream (Rating Upgrade)","Summary I'm upgrading DJT from 'sell' to 'hold' due to its recent $2.5 billion Bitcoin treasury announcement. Despite my prior bearish stance, DJT's valuation concerns remain, but the Bitcoin move introduces a new angle that could limit the stock's downside. A fresh bidder with $2.5 billion in ammo is perhaps wonderful for Bitcoin's short-term price potential. But there is a downside to this announcement, in my view. It would seem to now be politically impossible for the current Congress or administration to meaningfully grow a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, so long as it would benefit POTUS financially. In my prior Seeking Alpha coverage of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. ( DJT ), I've been bearish of the stock and primarily cited valuation and lack of business growth as major concerns for shareholders. While the stock hasn't fallen as far as I expected given the company's valuation relative to the size of its business, it has indeed fallen by over 30% since my initial 'strong sell' call back in October: DJT Calls (Seeking Alpha) In this article, I'll get into why I'm begrudgingly upgrading DJT from 'sell' to 'hold' in light of the company's recent Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury news, and I'll detail concerns I have more broadly for Bitcoin as a result of the announcement. For the remainder of this article, I'll be referring to Trump Media and Technology Group as TMTG. Another Meme For The Meme Stock Riders On May 27th, TMTG announced plans to raise $2.5 billion through common stock issuance and convertible notes for the purpose of buying Bitcoin to be held on the corporate balance sheet. This private placement reportedly includes 50 institutional investors, with $1.5 billion of the raise coming via common stock equity and the remaining $1 billion coming from convertible senior secured notes at 0.00%. DJT shares fell more than 10% in response to the release, and the expected close for the offering is May 29th. The purchase price of the common stock shares through the offering is $25.72 per share - so as of the May 27th close of $23.05, any shares sold through this agreement the day of the announcement are already underwater. In the past, I've argued that Bitcoin itself is very much a 'meme' even though it isn't considered a 'memecoin' akin to something like Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) or Pepe The Frog ( PEPE-USD ). In recent years, we've seen a preponderance of memecoins and meme stocks gaining market notoriety; I would absolutely classify DJT as the latter. So with TMTG now raising capital to buy Bitcoin in the same way that we've seen Strategy ( MSTR ) ( STRF ) and GameStop ( GME ) do in the past, we can add another layer of 'meme-dom' to DJT stock. I have two real takeaways from this announcement, and they both have to do with optics. First, the long-term business prospects for TMTG are likely quite problematic if the company is resorting to this type of strategy. And, frankly, that shouldn't be a real surprise. The company incinerates capital quarter after quarter and recently announced a net loss of $31.7 million in the three months ended March: DJT Q1 Net Loss (TMTG, 10-Q) Despite that, I'm still upgrading DJT solely because equity price declines could be limited from here if the price of Bitcoin continues to go up, as is the general expectation based on recent sentiment and capital flows. Through May 23rd, investor demand for Bitcoin-based financial products has eclipsed $10 billion year-to-date, with nearly $5.5 billion of that net flow coming in May alone. My second takeaway from the TMTG Bitcoin news is specific to BTC. SBR Dreams All But Over Assuming TMTG goes through with a planned Bitcoin acquisition that totals $2.5 billion, it would make the company the fourth largest holder of BTC in the public equity markets almost immediately: Company BTC Balance USD Value Strategy 580,250 $62,407 MARA Holdings ( MARA ) 48,137 $5,180 XXI 31,500 $3,390 TMTG 23,300* $2,500 Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 19,211 $2,066 Source: Bitcoin Treasuries, as of 5/28, *estimated based on $107.5k BTC price It's important to keep in mind that buying over 23k BTC at current prices would have an impact on the market. Thus, TMTG is unlikely to be able to acquire that much BTC with $2.5 billion without a larger correction in the price of BTC first. Strategy was able to buy roughly 25k BTC in May, but the market moved considerably during those acquisitions. Strategy's May purchases started with a BTC price closer to $95k and resulted in a coin price that briefly took out $110k. To be fair, Strategy is not moving the market alone. As mentioned in the prior section, there has been nearly $5.5 billion in BTC acquired through financial products like ETFs in the month as well. But the point is the price of BTC moves quickly when there is a sustained bid in the market, as we've seen so far in the month of May. Given that, my view is that if/when TMTG goes forward with BTC purchases, it would figure to put an end to any hopes and dreams for a larger US government-driven acquisition plan through a 'Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,' or SBR. Through a trust managed by his son, President Trump owns roughly half of the outstanding shares of DJT stock prior to the $2.5 billion PIPE. So when Bitcoin's price rises, it would directly benefit President Trump's net worth. Meaning, any BTC purchases either through the SBR or through a more formal Bitcoin Bill in the United States would be optically horrific for both the President and the GOP. Thus, should TMTG ultimately acquire $2.5 billion in BTC, I expect it would be politically dubious for the Trump administration or Congress to subsequently approve government-purchased BTC as well due to the impact it would have on DJT shares. Simply put, to avoid the 'pumping Trump's bags' with taxpayer money narrative, I don't see a politically acceptable path for the current admin or current Congress to pass the kind of Bitcoin Bill that is being proposed by people like Senator Cynthia Lummis. The negative campaign ads would write themselves. Further complicating any possible BTC holdings growth through the SBR is the fact that the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve currently only holds funds that have been seized due to illicit activities. While the administration has committed to not liquidating those funds, the March executive order laying out guidelines for the SBR stated BTC could be purchased through a budget-neutral allocation strategy. Again, this would seem to be nearly impossible to pull off politically, given that the budget bill recently passed by the US House of Representatives appears to grow the deficit through an increase in spending prior to a reported appropriations bill that may be forthcoming. Closing Summary As of article submission/publication, the Bitcoin 2025 conference is ongoing in Nashville, Tennessee. Vice President JD Vance was a Day 2 speaker at that event and called Bitcoin a \""strategically important asset for the United States over the next decade\"" as well as a \""hedge against bad policy making\"" in Washington. Neither of those assertions should give Bitcoin advocates a lot of confidence that building the SBR is a top priority for the administration currently. First, President Trump will be out of office in less than a decade. So if there is to be any large-scale purchase plan for the asset with a decade in mind, that plan likely needs to be implemented fairly soon. Second, the current administration has an impact on policy in Washington. I would have to imagine the executive branch believes it can influence good policy rather than bad. Thus, negating the need for a hedge on said policy. And as I laid out in the article, even if the POTUS were to encourage rapid SBR growth through purchases in the market, the optics of doing so when the President's majority-owned company owns $2.5 billion in BTC would be a political nightmare for both the President and the Republican Party. None of this means Bitcoin is a 'sell' today. But if you've been buying BTC thinking the United States federal government would start gobbling up coins at any price, I think TMTG buying Bitcoin has likely killed any hope of that actually happening.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790827-trump-media-and-technology-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-growth-distant-dream?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","DJT|BTC-USD",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T13:33:41.000Z,"Spot XRP ETF Approval Confidence Rises Massively","Crypto expert Amonyx (@amonbuy) recently highlighted a significant rise in confidence surrounding the approval of a spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), citing data from Polymarket that places the probability of approval at 84%. This surge in optimism reflects a series of regulatory and market developments that position XRP favorably within the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment products. BULLISH ALERT #XRP ETF confidence soars to 84% pic.twitter.com/Z0jVH1FBWL — Amonyx (@amonbuy) May 28, 2025 The recent launch of XRP futures by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was a pivotal moment for everyone anticipating spot XRP ETFs. CME’s introduction of XRP futures marks the first time this major derivatives platform has offered XRP-linked products, allowing traders to engage with the asset’s price movements without holding it directly. This development is essential because regulated futures markets have historically paved the way for spot ETF approvals, as seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Many market participants believe XRP will follow a similar path and see spot ETF approval on the horizon. The presence of XRP futures on CME strengthens the asset’s regulatory credibility and provides a foundation for issuers to advocate for spot ETF approval. Institutional Desire for Spot XRP ETFs Beyond futures, there is a growing number of spot XRP ETF applications under SEC review. More than ten applications are currently pending, with notable firms such as Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton among the applicants. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These applications have staggered decision dates, with some expected soon and others extending into October 2025. The SEC’s regulatory window allows up to 240 days for decisions, but market observers speculate that approvals could come sooner, given the momentum and excitement among market participants. Similar Products Show Huge Anticipation for Spot ETFs The launch of leveraged XRP ETFs, such as the recent offering by Teucrium, has demonstrated strong market demand and successful product adoption. Teucrium reported its XRP ETF launch as the most successful in its history , showing the community’s enthusiasm and the potential for spot ETFs to perform even better once approved. The convergence of CME’s futures launch, multiple pending ETF applications, regulatory clarity, and robust market interest has created a bullish environment for XRP. XRP is in a good spot, with multiple developments pointing toward a “bullish explosion,” and the approval of spot ETFs could be the final catalyst needed to kick off the price rally.

2025-05-29T13:30:44.000Z,"Bitcoin: Arkham Uncovers Massive MicroStrategy Address, Unlocking Transparency","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Arkham Uncovers Massive MicroStrategy Address, Unlocking Transparency In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, tracking the movements and holdings of major players is key to understanding market dynamics. One entity that has captured significant attention is MicroStrategy, led by vocal Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, due to its substantial MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings. Recently, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence made waves with a significant announcement regarding these holdings. What Did Arkham Intelligence Uncover About MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin? Blockchain data analytics firm Arkham Intelligence recently shared a notable discovery via an update on X (formerly Twitter). Arkham stated they had identified an additional Bitcoin (BTC) holding address belonging to MicroStrategy. The firm’s post provocatively read, “SAYLOR SAID HE WOULD NEVER REVEAL HIS ADDRESSES … SO WE DID.” This newly identified address holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin, specifically 70,816 BTC. This single address significantly adds to the known public footprint of MicroStrategy’s crypto assets. Prior to this identification, Arkham had already linked several addresses to the company. The Scale of MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Revealed by On-chain Data With the identification of this new address, the total amount of Bitcoin linked to MicroStrategy by Arkham Intelligence has reached a staggering figure. According to Arkham’s data, the total BTC amount they have identified is now equivalent to approximately $54.5 billion (valuation fluctuates with market price). This amount represents a significant portion of MicroStrategy’s publicly reported total Bitcoin holdings. Arkham estimates that the addresses they have pinpointed account for about 87.5% of MicroStrategy’s overall BTC stack. This level of transparency, derived from analyzing public on-chain data, offers unprecedented insight into the allocation and potential movements of a major corporate treasury’s digital assets. Why Are Identifying Bitcoin Addresses Important for Crypto Transparency? The ability to identify and link specific Bitcoin addresses to entities like MicroStrategy is a core function of blockchain analytics firms like Arkham Intelligence. While Bitcoin’s blockchain is often described as pseudonymous (addresses are public, but their owners are not explicitly named), sophisticated analysis can often connect addresses to real-world entities based on transaction patterns, timing, and other on-chain clues. This process contributes significantly to crypto transparency. It allows market participants, researchers, and regulators to gain a clearer picture of how large holders operate, potentially reducing information asymmetry. For investors, understanding where significant amounts of Bitcoin are held can provide context for market analysis, though it’s crucial to remember that identifying an address doesn’t predict future actions. Benefits of On-chain Data Analysis: Increased transparency regarding large holdings. Insights into the flow of significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Enhanced ability to track funds for compliance and security purposes. Data-driven analysis of market structure and participant behavior. Challenges and Considerations: Linking addresses is not always definitive or 100% accurate without additional information. Privacy concerns for individuals or entities who prefer their holdings not be publicly linked. The dynamic nature of blockchain means addresses and holdings can change frequently. Misinterpretation of data can lead to incorrect conclusions about market movements. MicroStrategy’s Strategy: A Deep Dive into Their Bitcoin Approach MicroStrategy’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset began in August 2020. Since then, the company has consistently added to its holdings through various means, including corporate debt offerings and excess cash flow. Michael Saylor has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and a superior store of value compared to traditional assets. Their strategy is unique among publicly traded companies in its scale and conviction. Rather than holding a small percentage, Bitcoin constitutes a significant portion of MicroStrategy’s balance sheet. This approach has made them a de facto proxy for Bitcoin investment on traditional stock markets. The identification of their Bitcoin addresses by firms like Arkham highlights the inherent transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain, even for large corporate holders. While MicroStrategy reports its total holdings, the on-chain data provides a layer of verifiable public information regarding the specific addresses used to store these assets. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers For those following the crypto market, the work of firms like Arkham Intelligence provides valuable on-chain data points. While you cannot directly control or predict MicroStrategy’s actions based on address identification, knowing where significant amounts of BTC are held by major players offers context. It allows analysts to potentially track large movements if they occur from these identified addresses, although large holders often use multiple addresses and sophisticated transaction methods. It’s an example of how public blockchain data, when analyzed effectively, can demystify aspects of the crypto market that might otherwise remain opaque. However, always combine on-chain analysis with fundamental market research and macroeconomic factors. Summary: Unlocking Insights into MicroStrategy’s Massive Bitcoin Holdings Arkham Intelligence’s identification of another significant Bitcoin address linked to MicroStrategy underscores the power of on-chain data analysis in shedding light on major market participants. By identifying addresses holding tens of thousands of BTC, Arkham has increased the known transparent portion of MicroStrategy’s considerable MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings. While contributing to greater crypto transparency, this also highlights the ongoing tension between the public nature of blockchain data and the desire for privacy by large holders. As the crypto market matures, the role of firms providing sophisticated on-chain data analysis will continue to be crucial for investors and the broader public seeking to understand this evolving asset class.

2025-05-29T13:30:18.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Struggling To Build Momentum And Reclaim $110,000","Bitcoin (BTC) is up a little over 1% as it looks to build momentum and reclaim the $110,000 level. Price action has been subdued after last week’s rally, which saw the flagship cryptocurrency race to a new all-time high. BTC is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $108,850. Meanwhile, analysts believe BTC has not reached the peak of its current bull cycle, predicting a jump to between $220,000 and $330,000. Arkham Intelligence Claims To Have Found Most Of Strategy’s Bitcoin Stash Blockchain analysis company Arkham Intelligence claims to have identified previously undisclosed wallet addresses tied to Strategy, potentially exposing billions in Bitcoin holdings. The firm referenced Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor’s commitment to privacy, claiming it had found an additional 70,816 BTC linked to Strategy. The latest discovery is valued at $7.6 billion at current prices. The newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If the findings are accurate, Arkham has discovered most of Strategy’s Bitcoin stash and publicly associated the wallets with the firm. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did.” Arkham’s discovery comes after Saylor discussed the risks of publishing wallet addresses. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Saylor stated, “No institutional grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth.” Saylor believes making Bitcoin wallets public allows every transaction to be scrutinized, exposing companies to risks that may not be immediately apparent. GameStop Confirms First Bitcoin Purchase US video game and consumer electronics retailer GameStop has confirmed its first Bitcoin purchase, announcing the acquisition of 4,710 BTC . However, the company has not specified how much it has paid or when the purchase was completed. The Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also provides few details. The value of the Bitcoin purchased is around $513 million at current prices. This is the first time GameStop has publicly acknowledged its Bitcoin purchase since announcing plans to move into Bitcoin investments. Meanwhile, GameStop (GME) stocks have climbed significantly since the company announced its Bitcoin pivot, climbing 12% in March. Data from TradingView shows GME closed at $35 on May 27 and traded at $36.30 during pre-market trading. The stock is up 30% in the past 30 days, with year-to-date gains of around 10%. Bitcoin Witnessing Surge In Corporate Adoption Several other companies besides GameStop have pivoted to Bitcoin since Michael Saylor’s Strategy began purchasing the flagship cryptocurrency in 2020. Companies, including Metaplanet and Meliuz, have added to their Bitcoin holdings this year after adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Trump Media and Technology Group also announced plans for a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin. European Crypto Firm K33 Raises $6.2 Million For Bitcoin Purchases Norwegian crypto brokerage firm K33 has raised 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) to fund planned Bitcoin acquisitions. The company announced it had secured financing through convertible loans and a new issue of shares and warrants, which “will be used in full to acquire Bitcoin in order to establish the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy.” Warrants are zero-interest securities that investors can convert to equity at the same price. The raise would allow K33 to purchase up to 57 BTC at just over $108,000 per coin. K33 CEO Bull Jenssen believes that Bitcoin will be the best-performing asset in the coming decade, adding the company plans to accumulate as many as possible while unlocking powerful operational synergies with its brokerage operations. “Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build your own? Initial financing is secured, and we are ready to accelerate from here!” Jenssen also added that K33 is working with Bitcoin treasury companies in the Nordics, and hopes to use its Bitcoin treasury to offer new services. “For K33, Bitcoin is not only a high-conviction asset — it’s also a strategic enabler. With a sizable BTC reserve, we will be able to strengthen our financial position while unlocking new revenue streams, product capabilities, and partnerships.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned under $110,000 as it struggles to build momentum. The flagship cryptocurrency has been marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $108,730. Price action has been subdued this week after last week’s rally, which saw the price surge to a new all-time high. BTC briefly crossed $110,000 this week but could not sustain momentum, falling below the level. Despite subdued price action, BTC is up nearly 15% over the past month, and analysts believe sentiment around the asset remains positive. Analysts believe that a BTC price peak is still 100%-200% higher than current prices, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency’s uptrend could continue despite the recent pullback. “But yes, I'm sure this cycle has peaked. Bitcoin cycles @ power law fit, a la 365-day SMA. At ~$110,000/coin today, the 365-dSMA is only touching the trendline; history shows each cycle moving 2-3x higher than this.” According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each cycle. With BTC around $110,000, analysts predict a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000, aligning with historical patterns where the price has consistently crossed the trendline during bullish phases. Bitcoin (BTC) ended the previous weekend positively, rising over 3% to $106,489. The price fell to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified but rebounded to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a decline of almost 1%. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,582. However, it lost momentum on Friday and plunged almost 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $107,356. Source: TradingView The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,095. BTC started the current week positively, registering a marginal increase on Monday. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,951. Selling pressure intensified on Wednesday as BTC fell over 1% and settled at $107,834. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $108,560, as buyers look to build momentum and reclaim $110,000. However, a bearish MACD indicates sellers have the upper hand.

2025-05-29T13:28:20.000Z,"Live Coin Watch Analysis Confirms: Bitcoin Solaris’s 4X Presale-to-Launch Growth Outperforms Market Averages","The post Live Coin Watch Analysis Confirms: Bitcoin Solaris’s 4X Presale-to-Launch Growth Outperforms Market Averages appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin Solaris isn’t waiting for market permission. It’s building momentum by design, and now, with Live Coin Watch confirming a projected 4X return from presale to launch, the spotlight is only getting hotter. But this isn’t just about numbers. This is a story about architecture, mobile-first access, and a chain finally doing what others promised. If you’re still thinking Bitcoin Solaris is just another new token, you’re already behind. From Bitcoin’s Ideals to Real-World Use Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) starts where Bitcoin left off. While Bitcoin made decentralization real, BTC-S is making it scalable and programmable. It’s built around a dual-layer blockchain—the Base Layer uses SHA-256 PoW for unmatched security, while the Solaris Layer delivers fast, efficient smart contract execution through DPoS. With finality in 2 seconds and up to 100,000 TPS, it’s capable of supporting DeFi, NFTs, and advanced dApps at scale. The chain isn’t just powerful—it’s accessible. The upcoming Solaris Nova app will allow users to mine BTC-S directly from their smartphones . No fancy rigs. No high electricity bills. Just real participation. Daily Wealth, Not Just Hype The way Bitcoin Solaris distributes rewards flips the script on typical crypto economics. Here, everyone contributes—and everyone earns. Mobile miners, validators, and stakers all share the block rewards: 40% goes to miners on the Base Layer 25% goes to validators on the Solaris Layer 20% is allocated to stakers 10% funds development 5% is reserved for community projects The Next Big Shift in Blockchain Has a Name—Bitcoin Solaris Rewards scale with long-term participation thanks to time-weight factors and contribution scores. Whether you’re validating blocks or staking from your phone, the protocol is designed to reward consistent effort, not just capital. Technology That Talks to Itself Cross-layer interaction is where the chain flexes its intelligence. The Solaris Layer routinely commits its state to the Base Layer, and validator elections are anchored in the PoW chain to prevent long-range attacks. The result? A system where security, speed, and flexibility coexist—not compromise. Its smart contracts are written in Rust, and initial tooling follows the Solana development model, making it easy for developers to deploy fast and migrate later. That Solana connection isn’t surface-level either—Bitcoin Solaris integrates with Solana’s infrastructure for bootstrapping, including shared tooling, cross-chain bridges, and compatibility with existing dApps. The Presale That’s Turning Heads It’s not just Live Coin Watch watching this unfold. With the presale running for just 90 days, the window is tight, and the pace is aggressive. BTC-S is currently priced at $5 in Phase 5, moving to $6 next, and locked in for a $20 launch. More than 11,000 users have joined, with $1.8M+ already raised. Plenty of influencers and blockchain analysts are already tuning in. A strong breakdown by Token Empire explores why this presale is attracting attention fast. And that’s the point: it’s short, aggressive, and backed by functionality—not just FOMO. Momentum Is a Signal You can feel it in the channels. Scroll through the active Telegram or check live updates on X, and you’ll see the same pattern repeating: new users, new questions, real curiosity. The conversations aren’t empty—they’re about infrastructure, mobile staking, launch dates, and potential returns. Even before launch, Bitcoin Solaris has been under serious scrutiny. It’s already been reviewed by multiple auditing firms— Cyberscope and Freshcoins —and passed a KYC verification to reinforce trust. Conclusion Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a lucky guess or a viral moment. It’s architecture, incentive design, and cross-layer innovation are packed into one of the fastest-moving presales this cycle. The technology is real. The wealth model is inclusive. And the window? It’s closing fast.

Here Are the Details","Norway-based crypto asset manager K33 has officially launched its Bitcoin treasury strategy, raising 60 million Swedish kronor (about $6.2 million) in new funding to purchase Bitcoin and expand its product range. Norwegian Crypto Company K33 Raises $6.2 Million to Buy Bitcoin K33, which is listed on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market, announced that it has increased its capital through newly issued shares and warrants worth 15 million Swedish kronor and convertible loans totaling 45 million Swedish kronor. “We believe Bitcoin will become an important part of the global financial system. I am excited to begin the process of building a strong balance sheet backed by Bitcoin. This is not only a strong investment conviction but more importantly, a strategic opportunity for K33 as a leading crypto broker,” said Torbjørn Bull Jenssen, CEO of K33. The company emphasized that the BTC purchase is not just an investment but a strategic move to support future product development, including improved trading margins and BTC-backed lending services. Jenssen added that the company is drawing inspiration from industry best practices as it focuses on its next phase of growth. K33’s latest earnings report, released on Wednesday, showed first-quarter revenue reaching 450 million Swedish kronor ($46.6 million), a 200% increase year-on-year and indicating that the company is growing rapidly and gaining momentum toward its Bitcoin-backed strategy. K33’s move mirrors the strategies of other cryptocurrency pioneers like Strategy in the U.S. and Metaplanet in Japan. While Strategy remains the dominant buyer, its pace has slowed recently due to the narrowing premium on its Class A shares (MSTR) and increased competition from institutional Bitcoin accumulation, according to K33 Research Director Vetle Lunde. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-29T13:20:39.000Z,"Unprecedented: Trump PEPE Post Shakes Memecoin Market","BitcoinWorld Unprecedented: Trump PEPE Post Shakes Memecoin Market In a move that captured significant attention across social media and the digital asset community, former U.S. President Donald Trump recently shared an image on his platform, Truth Social, that prominently featured the popular memecoin, PEPE. What Was the Trump PEPE Post All About? The image posted by Donald Trump on Truth Social depicted the former president himself, with the recognizable Pepe the Frog character, the unofficial mascot of the PEPE coin, positioned on the left side. This seemingly simple act immediately sparked discussion and speculation, given the figure involved and the nature of the digital asset highlighted. It wasn’t a direct endorsement or statement about cryptocurrency, but the visual association alone was enough to generate buzz. Understanding PEPE Coin News and Its Place For those unfamiliar, PEPE is an Ethereum-based memecoin that gained rapid popularity in 2023. Like many memecoins, its value is primarily driven by internet culture, community sentiment, and speculative trading rather than underlying technology or utility. It’s known for its volatile price swings, offering the potential for high rewards but also significant risks. According to CoinMarketCap data at the time of the original report, PEPE was trading at $0.00001493, showing a notable increase of 7.73% in the past day, illustrating the kind of rapid price movement memecoins can experience, often influenced by external factors like social media mentions. Why Does a Truth Social Crypto Mention Matter? The significance of the Trump PEPE post lies in the intersection of a major political figure with a niche, highly speculative digital asset. Donald Trump commands a massive following, and his activities on platforms like Truth Social are closely watched. When such a figure interacts, even indirectly through an image, with something like PEPE, it can draw unprecedented attention to the asset and the broader memecoin market. This exposure, whether intentional or not, can influence public perception and potentially trading activity, highlighting the growing overlap between political discourse, internet culture, and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Broader Memecoin Market The memecoin market is characterized by its unique dynamics. Unlike traditional investments or even established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, memecoins often derive value from hype, trends, and community engagement. Here are some key aspects to consider: High Volatility: Prices can skyrocket or plummet based on social media trends, news, or even simple mentions. Community-Driven: The strength and activity of the online community play a crucial role in a memecoin’s survival and price action. Speculative Nature: Investing in memecoins is highly speculative. There’s often no underlying product or service backing the token. Cultural Relevance: Many memecoins are tied to internet memes or cultural moments, giving them a unique appeal but also making their longevity uncertain. The Trump PEPE image serves as a potent example of how cultural and political events can unexpectedly intersect with and impact this part of the crypto landscape. Donald Trump Crypto Interest: What Could This Mean? While the post itself wasn’t a policy statement, it adds another layer to the evolving relationship between political figures and the crypto space. Donald Trump has previously commented on cryptocurrencies, sometimes with skepticism, but his campaign has also reportedly explored crypto donations. This Truth Social crypto mention, featuring a memecoin specifically, could be interpreted in various ways – from simply leveraging popular internet culture to a subtle nod towards a segment of his audience interested in digital assets. Regardless of the intent, it brings PEPE and memecoins into a conversation they wouldn’t typically inhabit, potentially signaling a growing, albeit complex, acknowledgment of crypto’s cultural footprint even in political circles. Actionable Insights for Readers The key takeaway from events like the Trump PEPE post is a reminder of the forces that can influence the highly speculative memecoin market. For anyone considering engaging with memecoins or interpreting such news: Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR). Understand that memecoins are extremely risky and volatile investments. Do not invest funds you cannot afford to lose. Be critical of social media hype, even when it comes from prominent figures. In conclusion, Donald Trump’s Truth Social post featuring PEPE is a remarkable instance of a niche digital asset crossing paths with mainstream political communication. It underscores the unpredictable nature of the memecoin market and highlights the increasing cultural visibility of cryptocurrencies, even reaching the highest levels of political discourse.

It’s an increase of almost 126% since the start of this year. Despite the boom in open interest, data show a growing caution near the $110k price level. As of now, the bitcoin price is trading around $108,567 , reflecting a slight drop. Bitcoin Options Open Interest Hits Record High According to data from Glassnode, the total open interest in Bitcoin options has surged to an all-time high of $46.2 billion, making a dramatic surge. In early 2025, total open interest sat around $20 billion. Since then, it has more than doubled, adding roughly $25.8 billion to reach today’s peak. This spike shows that both bullish and bearish traders are placing bigger wagers on where Bitcoin’s price might head next. $BTC options open interest recently hit an all-time high of $46.2B – up +$25.8B from the lows. This sharp growth outpaces futures and signals rising demand for more advanced hedging and strategy execution as market participants grow more sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/YXp24CRVfC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 Why Open Interest Matters? Open interest measures all active options contracts that haven’t been closed or settled. When open interest rises, it often means new money is flowing into the market. Meanwhile, a high open interest, especially at record levels, points to growing excitement and potential risk, since more capital is on the line. Key Level To Watch: $110,000 Right now, Bitcoin is trading below the $109,000 mark, and this level is considered very crucial. If Bitcoin breaks through, it could spark a fresh wave of buying that pushes the price even higher. But if it can’t hold, some traders think we could see a quick pullback.

2025-05-29T13:17:41.000Z,"Solana compresses near resistance, breakout to $241 likely if confirmed","Solana is tightening beneath a major resistance zone at $178. With bullish structure and a strong upward trend from $95, a breakout could send SOL soaring toward $241 in the near term. Solana’s ( SOL ) price action has been consolidating in a bullish manner underneath high time frame resistance at $178. After a strong trend that began with a low near $95, SOL has steadily climbed while respecting every key support level. Key technical points $178 High Time Frame Resistance: Currently acting as overhead supply, but showing signs of weakening as price consolidates just below. Apex Zone with Dynamic Support: Higher lows are compressing against resistance, supported by rising trendline confluence at $175. $241 Target: Next major high time frame resistance level if a breakout above $178 occurs with volume. SOLUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView What makes this setup especially compelling is how Solana has completed a textbook market auction. Price rotated from a value area low near $95 to the point of control at $124.56, also a major support, and then advanced toward the value area high, now pressing into the supply zone at $178. This full rotation signals sustained strength and growing bullish conviction. This consolidation beneath resistance appears constructive rather than bearish. The consistent formation of higher lows indicates that buyers are stepping in earlier on each dip, often a precursor to a breakout. The apex zone forming between $175 and $178 points to a potential breakout in the very near term. You might also like: SUI vs. Coldware: Coldware disrupts web3 sphere, draws attention from SUI holders Volume remains subdued, which is typical in the final stages of a consolidation. The key signal to watch will be a spike in volume accompanying a move above $178. If that occurs, it would likely trigger a strong upward expansion toward the $241 resistance level. Solana’s historical reactions to key supply zones suggest that when price compresses under resistance while forming higher lows, breakouts tend to follow with strong momentum. This pattern has repeated across previous cycles, where SOL paused beneath resistance before rapidly breaking out. If the current setup mirrors past behavior, the next leg higher could not only reach $241 but also establish the foundation for further upside—especially if supported by broader market strength. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Solana holds above dynamic support near $175 and continues to press into $178, a breakout remains the most likely scenario. A move above this level on rising volume would likely send SOL surging toward $241, maintaining its bullish market structure.

Table of Contents JD Vance’s Bitcoin dreams collide with Peter Schiff’s Bitcoin cynicism Peter Schiff’s latest stunt at Bitcoin 2025 Peter Schiff’s Bitcoin saga began long before the crypto conference invite A lonely contrarian at Bitcoin 2025 JD Vance’s Bitcoin dreams collide with Peter Schiff’s Bitcoin cynicism The Bitcoin 2025 conference unfolded in late May at the Venetian Convention Center in Las Vegas, drawing a wide cross-section of the global crypto community under one roof. Held from May 27 to 29 and organized by BTC Inc., the event was billed as the world’s largest gathering of Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates and brought together an eclectic mix of policymakers, investors, entrepreneurs, and open-source developers, all broadly united around the idea of accelerating global Bitcoin adoption Attendees included prominent political and business figures such as Senator Cynthia Lummis , Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump, and Strategy’s Michael Saylor , each offering a different lens into Bitcoin’s growing role in money, policy, and power. Over three days, the event offered a sharp look at Bitcoin’s place in geopolitics, financial infrastructure, and institutional strategy. Senator Cynthia Lummis called for clearer regulatory frameworks to encourage innovation. Vice President JD Vance praised Bitcoin’s ability to create new wealth outside traditional banking systems. Michael Saylor, never one to pull back on conviction, laid out a timeline in which Bitcoin replaces gold and fiat entirely, forecasting a price of $13 million by 2045. Eric Trump spoke of family-led mining ventures, adding a layer of political proximity to the asset class. Panels also dug into everything from layer 2 scaling to custody standards, while booths buzzed with startups pitching new solutions in payments, wallets, and decentralized ID. And yet, amid this crowd of advocates and visionaries, one attendee stood out for an entirely different reason: Peter Schiff. Known for his long-standing skepticism toward Bitcoin and his frequent warnings about its volatility and lack of intrinsic value, Schiff’s attendance caught many off guard. What exactly did he say this time, and how has his relationship with Bitcoin evolved over the years? Let’s take a closer look. Peter Schiff’s latest stunt at Bitcoin 2025 On May 28, during a fireside chat with journalist Natalie Brunell, Schiff delivered a set of remarks that stayed consistent with his long-held skepticism toward Bitcoin. Known for his advocacy of gold and criticism of fiat currencies, Schiff opened the conversation with a pointed comparison, referring to Bitcoin as a “memecoin” rather than a meaningful store of value. He argued that Bitcoin’s price is shaped more by speculative hype than by economic fundamentals, stating that it lacks the intrinsic value found in commodities like gold and silver. Schiff questioned the widely promoted idea of Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a phrase frequently used by Bitcoin supporters to highlight its scarcity and decentralized nature. To challenge that notion, he pointed to the behavior of central banks. “If gold is the past and Bitcoin is the future,” he asked, “why are central banks still accumulating gold and not Bitcoin?” According to Schiff, gold continues to be the reserve asset of choice for governments and central banks precisely because of its physical and historical permanence. He also used the platform to revisit broader economic concerns, reiterating his long-standing warnings about the U.S. fiscal trajectory. He criticized the growing national debt and rising inflation, describing them as symptoms of a deeply fragile monetary system. However, in contrast to many Bitcoin advocates at the conference, Schiff dismissed Bitcoin’s role as a hedge in such scenarios. He argued that Bitcoin’s price swings and lack of intrinsic utility undermine its reliability during crises, especially when compared to tangible assets like precious metals. One of the more widely discussed moments of the session came when Schiff humorously reflected on his role in Bitcoin adoption. “Every time I tell people not to buy Bitcoin, they buy more,” he said. He then added, “I’m probably responsible for more people owning Bitcoin than anyone else at this conference,” sparking humour and amusement among the attendees. Schiff also responded to Vice President Vance’s assertion that Bitcoin had created unparalleled wealth over the past decade. At Bitcoin 2025, JD Vance spoke about all the wealth created by Bitcoin and crypto. No actual wealth was created, as these tokens do not represent wealth. What has happened is a massive transfer of wealth from those who bought Bitcoin and crypto early to those who bought later.… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 28, 2025 He disagreed with the premise, suggesting that what Bitcoin enables is not wealth creation in the traditional sense, but rather a transfer of value from those entering early to those entering late, mirroring a pyramid-like structure rather than genuine economic innovation. Peter Schiff’s Bitcoin saga began long before the crypto conference invite As chairman of SchiffGold and chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, Schiff has repeatedly rejected the notion that Bitcoin holds any intrinsic value, often referring to it as a modern-day financial fad. His criticisms began early, long before digital assets gained mainstream attention, and have consistently drawn on historical comparisons. He compared Bitcoin to speculative bubbles such as the Dutch tulip mania of the 1600s, suggesting that enthusiasm around crypto is driven more by fear of missing out than by rational investment fundamentals. In 2019, Schiff was openly dismissive of projections that Bitcoin could one day reach $100,000, famously calling it “digital fool’s gold” and predicting it would eventually “go to zero.” When Bitcoin did cross the $100,000 mark in December 2024, he did not revise his stance. Instead, he attributed the rally to political influence and institutional lobbying, stating on social media that the price surge came from “buying off politicians and getting in bed with the government,” rather than genuine market confidence or fundamental strength. It's ironic that #Bitcoin only hit $100k by buying off politicians and getting in bed with government. Without expected government intervention, this milestone never would have been hit. What couldn't be done in a free market was achieved through the cohesive power of the state. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 5, 2024 In March 2025, he announced what he called a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” referencing the U.S. government’s own reserve strategy. “Just like the U.S. government, I’m developing a budget-neutral strategy for acquiring my bitcoin at no incremental cost,” he wrote, before posting a wallet address and inviting contributions. I've decided to create my own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Just like the U.S. government, I'm developing a budget-neutral strategy for acquiring my bitcoin at no incremental cost. Phase one of my strategy is inviting contributions to my reserve. 3CfJ9FqLPEWHnqf9PD5EWXTby8qYQ66BRX — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 8, 2025 Soon after, he followed up with another remark: “So far my Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is still empty. But I’m developing a Digital Asset Stockpile too. Several people have already sent me Solana. It seems that blockchain is much faster than Bitcoin.” Volatility is another area of concern in Schiff’s analysis. In April 2025, he noted that the U.S. Bitcoin Reserve had declined 12% in a single month while gold had gained 2%, using it to argue that Bitcoin cannot serve as a stable hedge in periods of financial stress. His critique gained more traction when he predicted that the same financial system crisis that had once helped fuel Bitcoin’s rise in 2008 could now be the reason for its downfall. “Bitcoin was born out of the financial crisis of 2008. Ironically, the financial crisis of 2025 will kill it,” he stated. Bitcoin was born out of the financial crisis of 2008. Ironically, the financial crisis of 2025 will kill it. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) April 10, 2025 Schiff’s skepticism also extends to individual players in the space. He has frequently criticized Saylor’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy at Strategy, calling it financially irresponsible. He has also poked fun at the broader crypto culture. In one instance, he claimed Dogecoin ( DOGE ) might be more honest than Bitcoin because its “open stupidity” makes it less misleading. Despite his critiques, Schiff’s consistent engagement with Bitcoin has led to ongoing speculation about his true position. Anthony Pompliano and others in the crypto community have jokingly suggested that Schiff secretly admires Bitcoin’s staying power, though Schiff has repeatedly denied this. A lonely contrarian at Bitcoin 2025 Schiff’s decision to attend Bitcoin 2025 came as a surprise to many in the crypto world. On May 26, he confirmed his involvement, stating that he would be presenting “contrarian opinions” at the event. “I’m off to Las Vegas for the Bitcoin conference this morning, where, ironically, I’ll likely be the speaker who best understands Bitcoin,” he posted on X. I’m off to Las Vegas for the Bitcoin conference this morning, where, ironically, I’ll likely be the speaker who best understands Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/hCor86JiMn — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 26, 2025 When asked on social media why he was attending an event centered on a technology he frequently criticizes, Schiff offered a direct answer. “It’s better to present contrarian opinions. What good is an echo chamber?” he responded, before adding that he would “bury” Bitcoin in the conversation. The tone extended beyond the post. Schiff was photographed at the conference wearing a red cap reading “Make Bitcoin Great Again,” a clear signal that he had come prepared to provoke discussion. On the ground at the Venetian Convention Center, Schiff shared an image of his small booth at the exhibit hall and noted, “By the time Bitcoin crashes for good, maybe I’ll be the one with the fancy booth.” Just set up my booth at the exhibit hall of Bitcoin 2025.

Others speculated, as they have for years, that he holds Bitcoin privately despite his public disapproval. That speculation intensified in April 2025, when Schiff’s investment firm, Euro Pacific Asset Management, was found to have indirect exposure to a Bitcoin-backed bond through Samara Asset Group. What made Schiff’s presence even more notable was the lack of other critical voices on stage. Most speakers at Bitcoin 2025 promoted the asset’s benefits, future potential, and role in reshaping finance. Schiff was one of the only participants to challenge that narrative openly. His debate with Natalie Brunell during the fireside chat served as the conference’s clearest example of intellectual opposition. Brunell urged him to reevaluate his position, suggesting he might eventually recognize Bitcoin’s merit. Schiff replied with a familiar stance: “I’m waiting for my moment to say ‘I told you so.” Audience reactions have been mixed. Some enthusiasts, as noted in community forums like Reddit, felt that including Schiff gave the event more credibility, encouraging open debate. Others questioned whether his participation undercut the conference’s mission. Regardless of interpretation, in 2025 even the strongest critics have become part of the larger Bitcoin conversation, shaping its evolution not just from the sidelines, but from within the room.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-2025-peter-schiff-criticism/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Feature|Bitcoin|conference|Peter Schiff",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T13:12:25.000Z,"Bitcoin price pulls back as analysts tout $1m–$2.4m potential","Bitcoin price has pulled back from its all-time high as investors take profits following a 50% surge from its April lows. Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $108,645 on Thursday, around $4,000 below its all-time high of $112,965. Analysts remain optimistic about further upside, citing ongoing demand and tightening supply dynamics. Speaking at a Bitcoin conference, Adam Back, the founder of Blockstream, noted the coin could climb to $1 million within the next five years. With Bitcoin trading at $108,645, a move to $1 million would represent an 825% gain from current levels. It would also give the cryptocurrency a fully diluted valuation of $21 trillion. Back is one of the most recognized figures in the crypto industry, having appeared in Satoshi Nakamoto’s original white paper . He now runs Blockstream, a crypto infrastructure company whose valuation peaked at $3.2 billion in 2021. Several other high-profile analysts also see significant upside for Bitcoin. Ark Invest projects it could reach $2.4 million by 2030, while BlackRock estimates a potential peak of $700,000. Michael Saylor has suggested Bitcoin’s market cap could eventually hit $100 trillion. The bullish case for Bitcoin price The core argument for higher prices is rising institutional demand. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have surpassed $45 billion in cumulative inflows, with the iShares Bitcoin ETF alone managing $71 billion in assets. Companies are also beginning to accumulate Bitcoin. Trump Media is raising $2.5 billion to buy BTC , while GameStop bought over 4,000 coins last week. Only a few publicly traded global firms have entered the space, leaving room for broader corporate adoption, particularly in light of Strategy’s success. Nation-states may also ramp up purchases. El Salvador was the first to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, and in the U.S., Donald Trump has proposed creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Pakistan, the Czech Republic, and Poland have also signaled interest in holding reserves.

2025-05-29T13:01:48.000Z,"SEC Urged to Exempt Most DAOs From Securities Rules","The organizations argue that sufficiently decentralized DAOs shouldn't be subject to the Howey test. This call was made amid a broader shift in the US government’s crypto stance under the Trump administration, which recently reversed Biden-era restrictions on including cryptocurrencies in retirement plans. Former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam also weighed in, and believes that without expanded CFTC authority, the crypto market will remain largely unregulated and exposed to risk. Meanwhile, former SEC crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins, now agency head, signaled support for blockchain innovation and pledged a less aggressive enforcement posture. However, critics have raised concerns about the Trump administration’s deepening ties to crypto, including ventures led by Trump’s family. Despite this, digital assets are still gaining ground in traditional US financial structures. SEC Urged to Rethink DAO Rules The DeFi Education Fund and the Uniswap Foundation have jointly urged the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to adopt a hands-off approach when it comes to regulating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In a letter dated May 27 addressed to SEC Crypto Task Force lead Hester Peirce, the two crypto advocacy groups argued that DAOs, if “sufficiently decentralized,” should not be assessed under the Howey test. This is the legal framework that is traditionally used to determine what constitutes a security. Part of the letter that was sent to the SEC Their argument centers on the belief that DAOs with a broad and active base of tokenholders operating in a decentralized governance model are fundamentally different from traditional organizations. As such, they should be treated as individuals or loosely associated groups rather than centralized entities. The letter pointed out that when a DAO exhibits decentralized control and enables community participation, its network token and related transactions should not be considered securities. This correspondence was submitted in response to Commissioner Peirce’s Feb. 21 request for public input on how crypto should be regulated. The call for the SEC to take a step back when it comes to regulating DAO’s happened during a major shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto under the Trump administration. Statement from the SEC Former crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins, now leading the agency, expressed his support for blockchain innovation. He recently criticized the Biden-era SEC for its aggressive enforcement tactics and signaled that the current leadership will avoid stifling technological progress. During a May 20 oversight hearing, Atkins confirmed that the SEC’s Crypto Task Force will release its first report in the coming months and is actively engaging the industry through a series of roundtables to better understand different perspectives. Trump Admin Reverses Biden-Era Crypto Investment Limits It is becoming more evident that crypto regulation is distancing itself from the Biden-era’s very aggressive enforcement. In fact, the US Department of Labor officially reversed a 2022 guidance that discouraged the inclusion of cryptocurrency in 401(k) retirement plans. The original guidance was issued during the Biden administration, and it urged plan fiduciaries to exercise “extreme caution” when considering digital assets for retirement accounts, due to concerns over volatility, valuation difficulties, and the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. Announcement from the Department of Labor The rollback restores a more neutral stance on investment decisions involving crypto and retirement portfolios. US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer framed the move as a rejection of what she called federal overreach, and stated that the department is “making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” By eliminating the prior advisory, the Labor Department is returning to what it describes as a “principled-based approach” that places decision-making back in the hands of retirement plan managers and fiduciaries. The 2022 guidance attracted a lot of criticism from industry groups, including the American Banking Association, which faulted the department for bypassing a proper public comment period before issuing the advisory. Other critics argued that the policy unfairly restricted innovation and limited Americans’ access to emerging asset classes in their retirement portfolios. This regulatory shift is also part of the broader changes occurring under President Trump’s administration, which took a far more supportive stance toward the cryptocurrency sector. Trump declared his intent to make the US “the world capital of crypto,” and his administration already scaled back enforcement actions by the SEC against well known Web3 firms like Uniswap, Coinbase, and Kraken. Officials have also initiated policy discussions surrounding real-world asset tokenization and the classification of digital tokens. However, Trump’s embrace of crypto has not gone unchallenged. Some lawmakers continue to voice concern over his growing influence in the digital asset space, calling for heightened scrutiny of his administration’s ties to the industry. Despite this, the revocation of the Labor Department’s crypto guidance is a clear indication that digital assets are gaining firmer footing in traditional financial infrastructure under the current administration. Crypto Needs CFTC to Be Regulated Meanwhile, former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam warned that the crypto market will remain largely unregulated unless the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is granted expanded authority. In a May 28 interview with Bloomberg TV, Behnam supported the view long held by many in the crypto industry that digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are commodities, not securities, and thus fall outside the jurisdiction of the SEC. (Source: Bloomberg ) However, he also acknowledged that the CFTC, under current law, is limited to regulating derivatives markets and does not have the authority to oversee the broader cash markets for these non-security digital assets. Behnam explained that neither agency can currently provide the regulatory clarity or protections needed without congressional action. “Until we do something, the market will remain unregulated,” he said, and warned that both retail and institutional investors will continue to be exposed to risks like fraud, manipulation, and conflicts of interest. His comments were made as the Trump administration faces scrutiny over its involvement in the cryptocurrency space. In particular, members of the Trump family have launched a range of crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, various meme coins, and a stablecoin project . These moves raised some serious ethical and legal concerns, with some lawmakers questioning whether the presidency is being used to benefit personal investments. American political strategist Sanders Townsend commented on the situation, and believes that Donald Trump is actively promoting his family’s crypto holdings and potentially leveraging his presidential powers in doing so. He warned that such activity may violate established rules governing elected officials and could present serious conflicts of interest. Behnam also responded to Vice President JD Vance’s recent remarks at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, where Vance declared that “we reject regulators” and called crypto a White House priority. While acknowledging the importance of innovation, Behnam pushed back on the anti-regulation sentiment by stating that regulators are essential to the functioning and credibility of US financial markets.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9359/sec-urged-to-exempt-most-da-os-from-securities-rules,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T13:00:44.000Z,"Major Polish insurer PZU joins crypto market with regulated Bitcoin fund","Leading Polish insurance company PZU announced it is entering the crypto assets market with a Bitcoin fund that will offer investors exposure to the cryptocurrency under EU rules. The minimum investment amount has been set to 100 Polish złoty, and the insurer pointed out that the valuation in Poland’s national fiat ensures currency stability for the new product. PZU responds to growing Polish interest in crypto with a Bitcoin fund Poland’s major provider of insurance services, Powszechny Zakład Ubezpieczeń (PZU), unveiled that it will be offering a product giving clients indirect access to Bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization. The new “inPZU Bitcoin” fund, to be launched through its investment firm TFI PZU, will replicate the rate of return of BTC, the company said in a press release quoted by the Polish financial news portal Bankier.pl and the English-language Warsaw Business Journal. PZU emphasized that it is presenting the product in response to the growing interest in digital assets among Poles and against the backdrop of the ongoing development and growth of cryptocurrency funds around the world. It also insisted: “This is the first investment fund in Poland aimed at a wide range of investors providing ‘pure’ exposure to Bitcoin.” Aiming for a low entry threshold, PZU has set the minimum initial deposit at just 100 Polish złoty (under $27) and does not require investors to have a brokerage account in order to take advantage of the offering. A 0.5% annual management fee applies as with the insurer’s other funds. The Bitcoin fund will be compliant with the European Union’s Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities ( UCITS ) regulatory framework for investment funds. The latter represents a popular investment option among small investors across the bloc. Currently, qualified investors in Poland can put money into Bitcoin through exchange-traded products (ETPs) and exchange-traded commodities (ETCs), listed on the country’s stock exchange and similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). PZU’s Bitcoin fund will invest at least 80% of its portfolio in ETC and ETP instruments with BTC serving as the underlying asset, the company said and noted: “The fund cannot purchase bitcoin directly on the market or enter into derivative contracts based on this cryptocurrency.” The InPZU Bitcoin fund is an index fund tracking the Bloomberg Bitcoin Index, seeking to reflect the price of BTC expressed in U.S. dollars, the insurer detailed. PZU also highlighted the improving perception of cryptocurrencies globally, marking last year’s regulatory approval of ETFs tracking the price of BTC by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a milestone in this regard. Investor interest in crypto assets is justified, PZU says The January 2024 decision of the U.S. SEC has translated into a dynamic increase in assets under management in such funds, the Polish firm elaborated, adding that funds investing in Bitcoin have already accumulated more than 150 billion dollars as of the end of May. The PZU analysts are convinced that investor interest in crypto assets is well-grounded as the average annual return on Bitcoin investments over the past 10 years is around 85%, which has earned it the “digital gold” title and acceptance as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin: Annualized returns over the last 10 years. Source: TFI PZU study, Bloomberg data The inPZU Bitcoin fund will go on sale on August 28, the press release unveiled. The Polish company warns that it is the riskiest product in its fund offering lineup, targeting investors who are aware of the high fluctuations in the value of crypto assets. PZU is Poland’s largest insurance and financial firm with over $118 billion in assets in 2024, according to the Forbes Global 2000 ranking . It is also one of the biggest insurers in Eastern Europe, where cryptocurrencies have been gaining recognition . In neighboring Czech Republic, for example, the central bank is considering adding Bitcoin to its currency reserves.

2025-05-29T13:00:00.000Z,"Trump Media & Technology Group: Bitcoin Is A Bad Idea","Summary Trump Media's Bitcoin treasury strategy won't solve its core issues of weak user engagement, deteriorating financials, and extreme overvaluation. The $2.5 billion capital raise exposes shareholders to high dilution and leverage, making DJT a risky, leveraged bet on Bitcoin's volatility. Valuation remains unsustainably high, with price-to-sales and price-to-book ratios far above industry norms, driven by a 'Trump premium' rather than fundamentals. Despite a possible bull case tied to Bitcoin's price, I see significant downside and maintain a strong sell rating on Trump Media shares. Co-Authored by Noah Cox and Brock Heilig Investment Thesis Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), President Donald Trump’s media and technology company, are down over 30% over the last six months and have fallen by more than 35% year-to-date. While the company is implementing a Bitcoin treasury strategy (that has worked well for lifting share prices of some firms), I don’t think this will work for the owner of Truth Social. Despite some major crypto moves that have garnered a ton of attention this week (thanks to the Bitcoin Conference), the company’s core performance remains poor. Weak social media traffic and deteriorating financials continue to haunt the company and prevent it from growing. Additionally, the lofty valuation is completely out of line with fundamentals, given DJT’s weak user engagement, high costs, and poor financial results. Even with Bitcoin on its balance sheet, this doesn’t change. The newly announced plan to put ~$2.5 billion into a Bitcoin reserve doesn’t solve DJT’s underlying problems. The plan could make the company some money, but there are far too many foundational issues that outweigh a potential Bitcoin treasury. At the end of the day, the company becomes a leveraged bet in Bitcoin. This could work, but I am concerned they will not be able to attract the same financing terms that fellow Bitcoin treasury company MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has attracted. Notably, since the Bitcoin treasury plan was confirmed, DJT’s stock has fallen over 10%. I think the market is seeing what I am fearing: this won’t work. Shares here are a strong sell. Why I'm Doing Follow-Up Coverage One of the main reasons why I’m doing follow-up coverage on Trump Media Group is because of their new plan to focus on a Bitcoin treasury. To be clear, I think some Bitcoin treasury solutions can work. We’ve seen this plan work with Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy (rebranded as Strategy), who holds more than 550,000 Bitcoin. Unfortunately, I don’t think the Trump Media Group inspires the same confidence. Back in January, the Trump family launched $TRUMP and $MELANIA crypto coins, named after the President and his wife. These quickly dropped in value. I think this has left a bad taste in investors’ mouths when it comes to the Trump family and crypto. To me, it seems like the company is trying to copy the crypto reserve playbook. I don’t think it's going to work. That is why I am doing follow-up coverage on the company. I am concerned about major dilution/financial strain on shareholders. This follow up analysis is meant to compare Trump Media Group’s strategy to those of successful crypto asset adopters. Bitcoin Reserve Here Is A Bad Idea One of the biggest indicators to me that this plan will fail for the company is because of high leverage and dilution. The company is raising roughly $2.5 billion, consisting of ~ $1.5 billion in new common equity and $1.0 billion in convertible senior notes. Relative to the size of the Trump Media Group, this is an enormous number, and it comes at the expense of shareholders. If Bitcoin’s price doesn’t climb substantially (or worse, it falls), the company could be stuck with a massive amount of debt to repay. Keep in mind for other Bitcoin treasury companies (like Strategy and GameStop ( GME )), the companies committed cash already on the balance sheet before financing more capital for more Bitcoin purchases. With this Bitcoin strategy, the owner of Truth social is now highly susceptible to extreme volatility. Putting a large chunk of corporate treasury into Bitcoin puts the company in a tough spot that exposes them to wild market swings. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, and critics have long noted that holding a big, volatile asset can risk severe financial losses. This is especially a concern for Trump Media and Technology Group because the company doesn’t have other stable cash-generating businesses. To compare, MicroStrategy has done a fairly strong job of segmenting risk by offering a host of convertible notes, preferred stock, and common shares to help investors buy the security they believe matches their risk preference. While I am not a fan of some of this capital structure, they have done a good job of segmenting risk here. Trump Media and Technology Group has not done this (at least yet). While the company claims that this Bitcoin play will create synergies for subscription payments and use cases within their Truth Social and Truth+ media and social media brands, I just don’t see the use case here. Bitcoin’s use case is not for payments (mainly). This is what stablecoins are for. In essence, they are trying to use an asset called “digital gold” to replace dollar payments vs. stablecoins (industry standard). This feels backwards and not a disciplined approach to crypto. Valuation The Trump Media and Technology Group’s valuation metrics still remain extreme by most standards. The company’s Trailing Twelve Months price-to-sales ratio is currently ~1,269 . When compared to the sector median of just 1.22, this is a steep 103,000% premium to the sector median. Personally, I think this is an incredible disconnect between price and actual revenue. While a Bitcoin treasury can be a strong move, in this case, I think this is a strong indicator that the stock’s current price level is unsustainable. Investors buying shares in this stock are paying over 1,000 times the company’s sales. This type of premium only makes sense if the company has both explosive growth and near-flawless execution, neither of which have materialized (I believe). Currently, their price-to-book ratio is also high. The TTM price-to-book ratio of 5.70 is 190.5% higher than the sector median of 1.96. In practical terms, nearly all of the stock’s market value is built on intangible goodwill, rather than on hard assets or earnings power. If Trump Media shares were to re-rate down to the typical industry price-to-book multiple, the stock would need to drop about 65% from current levels. In my opinion, the valuation premium appears to be almost purely a “Trump premium,” with investors betting on the celebrity and political relevance of the company’s figurehead, rather than any demonstrated business performance. Even with the Bitcoin treasury on deck, I still think these metrics will not improve a lot. On the operating side, costs are growing faster than revenues. For the full year 2024, cost of revenue increased 275% . This means that the company is spending significantly more to generate each dollar of sales, which is a concerning trend. With this, I think shares should trade at the sector median price to book ratio going forward. This would imply 65% downside from here. Bull Thesis Although I’m bearish on the owner of Truth Social, I want to highlight what, I think, is a small potential for a bull thesis here. After the company adopted their Bitcoin treasury strategy, I think this has ironically become their strongest bullish argument. Bulls argue that by raising $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin, Trump Media has positioned itself as a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin’s price. This means that if you’re very bullish on Bitcoin, owning stock in Trump’s media company could amplify that. If Bitcoin continues to appreciate, the company’s asset base and, theoretically, its stock price, could do really well. On this same front, another point bulls will point out is that this massive capital raise gives the company a war chest that could be used to fund new ventures, acquisitions, or technology development (the primary use of the offering is to purchase Bitcoin). They don’t have to spend it all on Bitcoin. These are all plausible. The reason I am bearish, however, is because I think these are unlikely. At the end of the day, though, there are tough realities that the company has to face. The $1 billion convertible note is essentially a huge bet that must be paid back (or converted) later. This means that if Bitcoin’s price doesn’t rise high enough, the company could end up with a depleted treasury and a large debt to service, putting shareholder equity in a precarious spot. If Bitcoin stumbles, there is absolutely no diversified revenue stream to fall back on, and this worries me greatly. This compares to MicroStrategy, which has a record of successfully refinancing debt. Takeaway While I am overall bullish on the concept of a Bitcoin treasury strategy, Trump Media and Technology Group’s new Bitcoin reserve strategy only strengthens my original bearish stance. The company’s core problems, like overvaluation, declining user engagement, and financial underperformance, remain unaddressed. If anything, I think that management’s decision to take a gamble on Bitcoin highlights a lack of viable solutions for the company. I see significant downside from here. For the company’s share price to make sense, either its social media business would need a strong turnaround, or Bitcoin would need to move much higher. Because of this, I am still a strong sell on shares of the Trump Media and Technology Group.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790718-trump-media-and-technology-group-bitcoin-is-a-bad-idea?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","MSTR|GME|STRF|STRK|DJT",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T12:58:18.000Z,"Dogecoin’s $1 dream: can the meme coin bark its way to a new all-time high in 2025?","Dogecoin (DOGE), the cryptocurrency born from an internet meme in 2013, has carved out an improbable yet significant niche in the digital asset market over the last decade. Created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a lighthearted counterpoint to Bitcoin, DOGE has since captivated a global audience of retail investors, its trajectory fueled by viral internet culture and high-profile endorsements. As the cryptocurrency market displays renewed bullish vigour in May 2025, a pivotal question dominates discussions: Can Dogecoin achieve the coveted $1 valuation by the end of the year? This exploration delves into the factors shaping DOGE’s price potential, considers expert analyses, and weighs the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. The story of Dogecoin’s rise is a testament to the unpredictable nature of the crypto space. Built as a fork of Litecoin’s blockchain and distinguished by its playful Shiba Inu mascot (inspired by the “Doge” meme), the coin initially garnered little serious investment interest. However, its fortunes dramatically changed during the 2021 crypto bull run. Propelled by a surge in social media hype and influential endorsements, DOGE soared to an all-time high of $0.73 in May of that year, according to data from CoinMarketCap. A key figure in this ascent has been Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, who has frequently expressed support for DOGE on social media, famously dubbing it the “people’s crypto.” Today, Dogecoin consistently ranks among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, often finding itself within the top 10. Its enduring appeal, largely community-driven and amplified by speculative trading, has maintained its relevance despite lacking the extensive utility of projects like Ethereum or Solana. As of late May 2025, DOGE is trading in the 0.22-0.25 range, based on recent market updates from platforms such as CoinDesk, showing signs of consolidation near critical resistance levels. Fueling the dream: catalysts for a $1 Dogecoin Several elements could converge to propel Dogecoin towards the $1 milestone by the close of 2025. Firstly, the overall health and trajectory of the broader cryptocurrency market are paramount. With Bitcoin having recently achieved new all-time highs, as reported by CoinDesk on May 26, 2025, altcoins like DOGE often benefit from the ensuing wave of bullish sentiment. Analysts consistently observe that meme coins, in particular, tend to flourish during periods of market euphoria, attracting retail investors eager for rapid gains. Secondly, the activity of large holders (often termed “whales”) and the sustained momentum of its dedicated community are significant price drivers. Recent analysis highlighted by CoinDesk indicates that Dogecoin has seen increased accumulation by these whales, signaling a growing confidence in its short-term potential. Furthermore, the DOGE community remains one of the most vibrant and active in the crypto sphere, with social media platforms abuzz with speculation, with price targets discussed on various online forums ranging from $1 to even $3 by year-end. Thirdly, external catalysts, notably the continued influence of Elon Musk and the potential for new integrations, cannot be discounted. Musk’s tweets have historically demonstrated the power to trigger sharp price spikes for DOGE. According to several reports, Dogecoin’s potential integration into X (formerly Twitter) as a payment option, a development that, if officially confirmed, could significantly boost DOGE’s adoption and, consequently, its price. Challenges on the path to $1 Despite the optimistic undercurrents, several formidable hurdles stand between Dogecoin and a $1 valuation. Unlike cryptocurrencies with a strong utility focus, DOGE’s primary use case remains largely confined to speculative trading and social media tipping. Its inflationary supply model—with 10,000 new DOGE minted every minute and no hard supply cap—exerts continuous downward pressure on its long-term value, a point highlighted in a Forbes Advisor India analysis from November 2024. This contrasts sharply with Bitcoin’s deflationary mechanics, making sustained value retention a persistent concern for DOGE investors. Market volatility represents another inherent risk. Meme coins like Dogecoin are notoriously susceptible to rapid and dramatic price swings, often driven more by hype and sentiment than by underlying fundamentals. A recent machine learning prediction by CoinCodex, reported on Bitcoinist.com on May 28, 2025, suggested that DOGE could face further declines in the short term, potentially closing May below its current levels. Should broader market conditions turn bearish, DOGE’s rally could easily stall well short of the $1 target. Regulatory uncertainty also casts a long shadow. Governments worldwide are progressively tightening their oversight of the cryptocurrency sector, and meme coins, due to their speculative nature, often attract particular scrutiny. Any adverse regulatory developments in major markets, such as the US or the European Union, could significantly dampen investor enthusiasm for DOGE. Expert opinions and market sentiment: a spectrum of predictions Price predictions for Dogecoin in 2025 are, unsurprisingly, diverse, reflecting the asset’s speculative character. According to a report by Coinpedia.org, updated on May 15, 2025, some analysts project that DOGE could reach highs of $1.07 in 2025 if the popularity of meme coins continues its upward trajectory. Similarly, Changelly’s blog, in an update on May 28, 2025, offered a bullish outlook for DOGE, citing historical price patterns and prevailing market sentiment as indicators of potential growth toward the $1 level. However, not all forecasts share this optimism. CoinCodex’s recent analysis presented a more conservative estimate, predicting that DOGE might struggle to break past the $0.70 mark without significant new catalysts. These divergent viewpoints underscore the inherent uncertainty surrounding meme coins, whose price movements often defy traditional financial analysis. From a technical standpoint, recent reports on TradingView News indicate that DOGE is currently testing crucial resistance levels in the 0.24-0.25 range. A decisive breakout above this zone, supported by high trading volume, could pave the way for a push towards $0.50 and potentially beyond. Conversely, a failure to hold current support levels might trigger a pullback, further delaying any approach to the $1 target. The significance of $1 Should Dogecoin reach the $1 mark in 2025, it would represent a historic achievement, nearly tripling its current price and propelling its market capitalization into the tens of billions. Such a surge would likely attract an even larger influx of retail investors, further cementing DOGE’s status as a cultural phenomenon within the cryptocurrency space. It could also ignite renewed interest in other meme coins, potentially sparking another speculative frenzy across this volatile sector. Conversely, a failure to reach this symbolic milestone could temper enthusiasm, particularly if driven by broader market downturns or a simple fading of the current hype. Investors are advised to remain cautious, as meme coins are inherently high-risk assets, prone to dramatic boom-and-bust cycles. A question of momentum, sentiment, and time As of May 2025, the question of whether Dogecoin will achieve a $1 valuation by the end of the year remains firmly in the realm of speculation. While bullish factors such as strong market momentum, significant whale activity, and the ever-present potential for high-profile endorsements offer glimmers of hope, formidable challenges including its inflationary tokenomics, inherent volatility, and looming regulatory risks cannot be dismissed. Expert predictions offer a mixed bag, with some viewing $1 as an attainable target while others urge considerable caution. For now, investors should approach Dogecoin with a balanced perspective, acknowledging both its speculative allure and its inherent uncertainties. As the dynamic cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, only time will reveal if the “people’s crypto” can once again defy expectations and reach new heights.

2025-05-29T12:50:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Predictions from $130K to $1.5M: What’s the Next Crypto to Buy Now?","Bitcoin dominates the crypto headlines. But after everything we’ve seen, is it possible that we still don’t talk about it enough? Recent trading sessions pushed $BTC to a new all-time high of $111K. While the price has pulled back slightly since then, there’s no real sign of a major retreat. Quite the opposite, by some key measures, there’s plenty of room for upward movement. Expert after expert, from Cathie Woods to Arthur Hayes, sees Bitcoin going much, much higher. Here’s why, even after constant coverage, you still might be undervaluing Bitcoin. Prediction Lineup: From $130K to $1.5M If you feel like everyone’s been calling for major Bitcoin gains, well, you’re not wrong. Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital founder and former Goldman Sachs partner, sits on the more conservative end of the spectrum with his predictions. But even he thinks Bitcoin will move to between $130K-$150K by the end of the year. Arthur Hayes of BitMEX is looking for roughly double what Novogratz thinks . Bitcoin at $250K would be another game-changing increase, allowing everyone who bought in at current price to double their investment by the end of the year. But Cathy Woods of Ark Invest takes the cake for the most ambitious prediction of them all – $BTC to hit $1.5M . That’s going to take a little while, admittedly; she’s calling for it to take until 2030. Taken all together, one thing is crystal-clear; the experts all expect Bitcoin to keep going far past its current level. And they may be on to something. Market Analysis: Crypto Not Overheated, Room to Grow, NYDIG Says According to recent research from NYDIG, there’s plenty of room for Bitcoin to continue its upward momentum. One key idea when analyzing the risk in the Bitcoin market is the idea of overheating – an asset growing too quickly, leading to excessive speculation and setting things up for a correction (or worse, a crash). Several metrics indicate that so far Bitcoin is relatively cool, with little of the wild growth seen in previous cycles. Take futures, for example: Perpetual futures funding rates sit at 6.2%, practically nothing compared to the 100%+ rates seen in earlier cycles. It indicates that Bitcoin could heat up significantly on its way to new highs – such as the ones the experts suggest in the $250K+ range. We outline the historical trough-to-peak multiples and provide a range of estimated prices based on those precedents. While these are just rough benchmarks, they suggest there’s still meaningful upside potential for Bitcoin. — NYDIG, We’re At An All-Time High It’s worth noting that as Bitcoin and the crypto markets mature, the range of trough-to-peak returns will naturally diminish. Unless Cathy Woods is correct, of course, and $BTC shoots to $1.5M quicker than anyone expects. In that case, all bets would be off. In the meantime, there’s room in the market for continued growth, and these three projects should be on your shortlist of the next cryptos to explode to take full advantage. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – 3 More Ways To Earn On Bitcoin’s Rise $BTC is expensive. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is not – but it gives you a way to diversify your exposure to the world’s most successful crypto. The project uses a combo of token burns and airdrops to link $BTC’s and $BTCBULL’s performance together. Every time Bitcoin hits a key price milestone on the way to $250K, either a token burn occurs (exerting deflationary pressure) or an airdrop lands (rewarding token holders with free crypto). Here’s the breakdown: $BTC $125K – $BTCBULL token burn $BTC $150K – $BTC airdrop (for BTC Bull Token holders in Best Wallet app ) $BTC $175K – $BTCBULL token burn $BTC $200K – $BTC airdrop $BTC $225K – $BTCBULL token burn $BTC $250K – $BTCBULL airdrop Three $BTCBULL token burns, two $BTC airdrops, one massive $BTCBULL token airdrop to round things out. Even a few weeks ago, when the BTC Bull token presale began, $250K for Bitcoin might have seemed ambitious. Now, ‘Bitcoin to $250K’ falls toward the low range expert predictions. Our own price prediction indicates $BTCBULL could hit $0.06467 by the end of the year , a 2,450% increase from its current $0.002535. Check out our research on how to buy BTC Bull token , and visit the presale page . 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Sniff Out and Snipe Best Meme Coins with Snorter Bot By the time the latest Solana meme coin hits your local CEX, it’s already too late; the big gains are probably past; it’s part of the reason why smaller launches or crypto presales are so important. Snorter Token ($SNORT) lets you sniff out deals in the early days, finding the hottest Solana meme coin launches on Telegram. Find them, snipe them, trade them, profit. It’s part of a rapidly-growing crypto trading bot market segment forecasted to reach $154B by 2033 . The $SNORT token is multichain on both Solana and Ethereum, and investors can move them back and forth via the Portal Bridge, in order to take advantage of the best opportunities. The bot includes a number of advanced features for better, safer trading and meme coin sniping. Those include: Secure swaps Automated sniping Honeypot detection Rugpull protection Limit orders Copy trading $SNORT also offers an industry-leading combination of features aimed at keeping you safe from memecoin bad actors, along with other features intended to power-up your trading. The token can be staked for an estimated 1,791% APY; the rate is dynamic, and you won’t beat that rate in the early days of the presale. Plus, the presale has raised over $165K in less than 24 hours. Visit the Snorter Token presale page to take advantage of the token’s lowest-ever presale rate of $0.0935. 3. Toncoin ($TON) – Telegram-Centric Token Up 5% Weekly The Open Network’s Toncoin ($TON) began life as Telegram’s native token. It has since expanded beyond Telegram, but there’s still a close tie between the social media channel and $TON’s performance. Recent news that Elon Musk was mulling a connection between X’s Grok AI and Telegram was enough to send $TON’s price up nearly 5% over the past week (though the deal didn’t go through for now). Toncoin aims to bring 500M users on-chain, only half of its estimated 1B monthly active users. The app is among the top-10 most popular social networks in the world. That’s a huge potential market for $TON. With Snorter Token ($SNORT) coming to Telegram after the presale, that market could grow even further. How Fast Will Bitcoin Hit $130K Predictions? Whether Bitcoin hits $130K this year or $1.5M by 2030, one thing is clear – the upside potential remains strong. With $BTC market conditions still relatively cool and expert forecasts aligning on further growth, now is the time to find the best cryptos to buy .

2025-05-29T12:49:52.000Z,"Best Betting Sites for Esports – Esports Betting in Canada","Esports betting keeps blowing up in Canada, and it’s not slowing down in 2025. Whether you're betting on CS:GO, Valorant, LoL, or Dota 2, you need platforms that pay fast, accept crypto, and don’t waste your time with endless forms. We’ve tested the best betting sites for esports that welcome Canadian players and support smooth crypto wagering from the first deposit to the final payout. If you're looking for trusted, no-fuss platforms for esports betting in Canada, this list breaks down the best options that actually deliver. Why Esports Betting Is Huge in Canada Right Now Esports used to be a niche thing — now it's a full-blown betting scene with millions of fans and real money on the line. In Canada, esports betting has grown fast, and 2025 is shaping up to be the biggest year yet. From big titles like Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, and League of Legends, to tournaments streamed live 24/7, Canadian players have more reasons than ever to get in on the action. The Shift to Real Esports Markets It’s no longer just “who wins the match.” You can bet on first kills, map wins, total rounds, clutch plays — all of it. Esports betting platforms now offer just as many props and live bets as traditional sports. The odds are sharper, the lines are tighter, and the action never really stops. That kind of variety is exactly why the best betting sites for esports are pulling in more crypto bettors every year — especially in Canada, where traditional sportsbooks often lag behind or limit esports coverage. Crypto Makes It Easier for Canadian Players Getting your funds in and out of Canadian sportsbooks can be a headache. Banks block payments, credit cards get rejected, and withdrawal times drag. With crypto? None of that. Top platforms for esports betting in Canada let you deposit Bitcoin, ETH, USDT, or other crypto, and bet in seconds — no middlemen, no red tape. The best betting sites for esports all support fast, low-fee crypto payments, and that’s made a big difference for Canadian players who just want to bet, watch, and cash out. Betting Where the Action Is Canadian players are betting on international tournaments more than ever — LEC, LCS, The International, BLAST Premier, and more. And because matches happen around the clock, esports betting gives players way more flexibility than traditional sports ever could. The sites we’re about to cover offer full match coverage, live streaming, crypto bonuses, and — most importantly — no KYC delays. How We Picked the Best Esports Betting Sites There’s no shortage of sites claiming to offer esports betting. But when you actually log in, most of them fall short — outdated design, weak odds, or just a tiny selection of matches. To build this list, we looked for the best betting sites for esports that actually work for Canadian players, especially those betting with crypto. Here’s what mattered when picking the winners. Full Esports Coverage — Not Just the Big Names We looked for sites that go beyond just League of Legends and CS:GO. The top sites on this list offer betting markets for: Valorant Dota 2 Rainbow Six Overwatch StarCraft II Call of Duty And tons of smaller leagues and regional tournaments Live bets, map-specific odds, and prop bets were a must. Crypto-Friendly Banking Every platform on this list supports crypto — and not just Bitcoin. We prioritized sites that also take Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether (USDT), and sometimes even coins like Dogecoin or Monero. These platforms offer quick, secure transactions without the usual banking headaches in Canada. No KYC (or Optional Only) KYC is a dealbreaker for a lot of crypto bettors. We only included sites that either don’t require verification or only ask for it at very high withdrawal limits. That means Canadian players can stay private, sign up fast, and move their money freely. Solid Odds and Betting Tools We compared odds across all platforms to make sure they were competitive. Sites that offer live odds changes, detailed match stats, early markets, and clear bet slips ranked higher. Some even offer bet tracking and esports-specific promos. Clean Interface and Mobile Access Whether you’re watching from your laptop or betting from your phone, the platform needs to run smoothly. Every site here loads fast, works on mobile, and makes it easy to find esports markets without digging through menus built for traditional sports. Best Betting Sites for Esports – Top Picks for 2025 Some sites just slap together a few esports lines and call it a day. Others actually treat esports like the full betting market it is — live odds, real-time updates, and enough match options to keep up with tournaments around the world. If you're in Canada and betting with crypto, you want speed, flexibility, and coverage — not just a few CS:GO games buried under a wall of soccer and hockey odds. These are the best betting sites for esports in 2025, and every one of them accepts crypto, works for Canadian players, and has legit esports action every day. 1. Haz Casino (Kryptosino) Bet on Esports at Haz Casino (Kryptosino) Kryptosino (formerly Haz Casino) isn’t trying to copy traditional sportsbooks.

The layout is super minimal, which makes it perfect for quick bets without the clutter. Crypto Handling Supports BTC, ETH, LTC, USDT, and more Simple wallet deposits and fast crypto cashouts KYC rarely comes up unless you're hitting high withdrawal levels Bonuses Cryptobosscasino typically has a deposit bonus and occasional cashback offers, both of which apply across the site. While there’s no dedicated esports promo, nothing blocks you from using a bonus in the sportsbook. This one’s not built for people who want a million features. But if you care about being fast, staying private, and placing a bet on the next round of a CS:GO final without delay — Cryptobosscasino checks those boxes. How to Start Betting on Esports with Crypto You don’t need to be a tech wizard or a crypto expert to bet on esports with digital coins. In fact, the whole process is often quicker than using traditional payment methods — especially if you’re in Canada, where card payments or e-transfers can get blocked or delayed on betting sites. Here’s how to go from zero to placing your first crypto esports bet in a few easy steps. Step 1: Set Up a Crypto Wallet Before anything else, you’ll need a crypto wallet — this is where your Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT will live. Simple wallet options: Trust Wallet (mobile) Exodus (desktop and mobile) MetaMask (browser extension) Once it’s set up, back up your seed phrase and keep it somewhere safe. That phrase is the only way to recover your funds if you lose access. Step 2: Buy Some Crypto You can buy crypto on any major exchange like: Coinbase Binance Kraken After buying your preferred coin (BTC, ETH, LTC, or USDT are all widely accepted), send it to your wallet address. Most transfers are completed within minutes. Step 3: Choose a Betting Site Scroll back up and choose one of the best betting sites for esports from this list. If you want full esports coverage with fast withdrawals, Bassbet and Kryptosino are great. For something simple and quick, try Unlim or Auf. Click the link, register with your email, and head to the deposit section. Step 4: Make Your First Deposit Copy the deposit address from the site Go into your wallet and paste it as the recipient Choose the amount and confirm the transfer Your funds will show up in your betting account once the blockchain confirms the transaction — usually within 5 to 15 minutes depending on the coin. Step 5: Start Betting on Esports Now just go to the esports section, find a match you want to bet on, and pick your market. You can go with match winner, map totals, or live in-play options. Confirm your bet, and you’re in. Tips for Smarter Esports Betting Anyone can throw money at a match, but winning — or at least not draining your crypto wallet in a weekend — takes a bit of strategy. Whether you’re betting casually or trying to grow your bankroll over time, these tips will help you get more out of the best betting sites for esports in Canada. 1. Know the Game Before You Bet If you don’t understand how Valorant’s economy works or what a CS:GO map veto is, don’t bet yet. Take some time to watch matches, learn how the game flows, and understand what actually influences outcomes. Knowing the meta and team styles is just as important as reading odds. 2. Bet Live — But Only If You Can Keep Up Live betting is exciting, especially in esports where momentum shifts fast. But odds can swing wildly, and hesitation will cost you. If you’re going to bet in-play, use a platform with fast updates (like Bassbet or Bitsler), and only bet if you’re actively watching the match. 3. Use Stablecoins for Bankroll Management Instead of betting with Bitcoin or Ethereum — which can jump in value overnight — consider using USDT or other stablecoins. This keeps your bet values consistent and helps you track wins and losses more clearly. 4. Don’t Chase Comebacks Esports can be unpredictable, and big comebacks do happen — but betting into a losing streak hoping for a miracle usually backfires. Set a budget, bet within it, and don’t try to recover losses in one go. Even the best esports betting sites can’t help if your emotions run your bets. 5. Shop Odds Across Multiple Sites One site might have CS:GO at 1.75 while another offers 1.85 for the same team. It might not seem like much, but those little bumps add up fast. Use multiple platforms (like Librabet + Spinbet) to compare odds before locking in big bets. 6. Focus on a Few Titles Stick to games you follow. If you’re solid on League of Legends, bet LoL. Don’t start placing wagers on Rainbow Six just because it’s the only match left on a slow day. Specializing helps you catch value when others are betting blind. Conclusion If you're into esports and betting with crypto, there's no reason to stick with slow, clunky sportsbooks. The sites we’ve listed actually work — fast deposits, no KYC walls, and real coverage of the games people in Canada actually care about. Some platforms, like Bassbet and Kryptosino, are built for serious esports bettors. Others, like Auf and Unlim, are perfect for quick bets with no hassle. Whatever your style, you’ve got solid options here — and they all pay out in crypto. Pick one that fits what you're looking for, throw in a few bets, and see how it goes.

2025-05-29T12:45:52.000Z,"Bitcoin May Enter Sideways Phase Without Fresh Buying Pressure, Warns Willy Woo","Bitcoin’s recent price rally appears to be losing momentum, and a lack of strong buying this week could result in another extended consolidation period, according to on-chain analyst Willy Woo. Writing on X on May 28, Woo warned that the strength behind BTC rally from $75,000 on April 7 to its all-time high just under $112,000 on May 22 is “starting to break down.” “This week is absolutely critical,” Woo wrote. “If we do not get follow-through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” He pointed to the current behavior of speculators entering long positions late and noted signs of profit-taking based on the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which reflects the difference between buying and selling prices. Woo believes BTC is now in a “pivot zone,” with the outcome of this week’s price action likely to determine the trajectory for the next month or two. Despite the near-term risks, he remains optimistic about the bigger picture. “Buy-side liquidity is dominating,” Woo added, suggesting that long-term fundamentals remain strong. Pressure Builds Near Key Price Levels In addition to Woo’s remarks, analysts at crypto exchange Bitunix echoed concerns around a potential short-term pullback. They emphasized that BTC is facing technical resistance around $110,800 — a level where recent rallies have stalled and which now serves as a battleground between bullish and bearish traders. Support at $108,000 has proven significant over the past two days, but Bitunix cautioned that a break below this level could trigger more profit-taking and shift the market bias toward the downside. A slight rebound in U.S. consumer sentiment this week could provide a short-term boost to risk appetite, but analysts agree that without a clear breakout above resistance, Bitcoin may continue moving sideways for a while. Bitcoin Bold Predictions Amid Uncertain Near-Term Outlook Despite the immediate uncertainty, some big names remain highly bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects . Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump predicted BTC could hit $170,000 by the end of 2026. Meanwhile, Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back went even further , forecasting a $1 million BTC price within five years. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $108,785, with no major movement in the past 24 hours. It struggled to gain traction above $108,000 in early trading on May 29.

2025-05-29T12:45:40.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as UK’s Crypto Ownership Surges to Global Lead","On May 27, Gemini published its State of Crypto report , revealing that the United Kingdom vaulted ahead of every surveyed economy—including the United States—in year-over-year growth of new cryptocurrency holders. This surge comes even as London’s regulators have yet to roll out a full crypto rulebook, underscoring a grassroots momentum that’s rewriting adoption curves across Europe. With nearly one in four Britons now owning digital assets, the ripple effects could reshape both retail and institutional appetites, setting a precedent for markets still finding their footing. As investors weigh the shifting landscape and seek tactical entry points, savvy traders will be hunting the best crypto to buy now. UK Surpasses Global Crypto Adoption Rates, Leading the Way in Individual Ownership Growth The United Kingdom has outpaced all other surveyed nations in the climb of individual crypto ownership, soaring from 18% in April 2024 to 24% a year later, according to Gemini’s latest State of Crypto report. This leap places Britain ahead of economies such as the United States, France and Australia, despite London not yet enacting its own comprehensive crypto framework. The report, based on a poll of 7,200 adults across the U.S., Europe, Singapore and Australia, highlights Europe’s overall leadership in adoption—with Singapore still boasting the world’s highest ownership rate at 28%. France also saw notable gains, rising from 18% to 21%, while U.S. participation ticked up from 21% to 22%. Together, the combined ownership rates in these major markets climbed from 21% to 24% over the past year, suggesting nearly one-quarter of global respondents now hold cryptocurrency. Gemini attributes this broad upswing to a more favorable regulatory climate in Europe following the bear-market downturn of 2022 and to positive policy signals out of Washington that have lifted sentiment abroad. Despite its regulatory lag, Britain’s financial clout and reputation as a global hub appear to be drawing a fresh wave of enthusiasts eager to stake their claim on digital assets, signaling that crypto’s mainstream moment may be arriving sooner than many expected. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Britain’s crypto cohort swells and Europe braces for stricter MiCA rules, market liquidity and institutional interest are poised to climb. Demand signals from leading economies suggest that the tokens primed for breakout could enjoy tailwinds from both regulatory clarity and mass adoption. Savvy investors scanning the horizon will be eyeing the market, with the best cryptos to buy now on their radar. Snorter The United Kingdom’s report signals growing adoption of digital assets across the globe. And as more investors pivot to crypto as digital gold and hedge against inflation, they’ll need a fast bot that can help them automate every step of the on-chain trading workflow, capitalizing on every potential market opportunity before it becomes public knowledge. Enter Snorter , the fastest and lowest-fee Telegram-native trading bot, designed to deliver sub-second sub-second execution and MEV resistant routing. No delays, no missed entries—it’s purpose-built to ensure instant swaps and help investors gain entry into trending meme coins quickly so that they can take the most advantage of their parabolic price movements. A key aspect of Snorter is its on-chain scanner, which automatically detects every rugpull, honeypot, stealth trap, or any other common rug vectors. Other premium features include automated copy trading, scheduled limit orders and stop-losses, and portfolio tracker with live P&L. The fact that each of the aforementioned features is accessible directly on Telegram streamlines the overall trading experience. And unlike other sniper bots that are limited to a single chain, Snorter has a multichain appeal. It took off with Solana, with plans to expand to other EVM-compatible chains soon. Considering the importance of its use cases—especially as nations pivot to crypto—it’s no surprise that the project’s presale has seen strong demand within hours of launch, raising over $150k. And that’s not even all! Prominent publications such as NewsBTC, Cryptonomist, and others have positively reviewed the project, highlighting its significance to the crypto trading landscape. Best Wallet Token With more Britons logging into crypto wallets than ever, Best Wallet Token powers a secure gateway for new investors stepping onto the digital asset stage—offering intuitive features that match today’s adoption surge. Best Wallet lets users explore new projects early through its “Upcoming Tokens” section, helping them identify potential breakout tokens before they gain widespread attention.

Solaxy Tapping into the Solana ecosystem’s explosive growth, Solaxy’s Layer-2 scaling solution supercharges transactions and slashes fees—making it an ideal play for investors chasing network-wide adoption. Solaxy ($SOLX) has smashed the $42 million presale milestone as Solana’s First Layer-2 Solution. Investors rush to secure tokens before the 18-day countdown ends, eyeing long-term scalability gains. Built to combat Solana’s congestion woes, Solaxy offloads transactions off-chain, bundling them for faster, smoother mainnet processing—even during peak traffic surges. Tokenomics fuel optimism: 25% of supply funds staking rewards, while 30% backs development, balancing hype with infrastructure growth. Institutions eye Solana for real-world asset tokenization, raising stakes for $SOLX—its success could amplify demand for both Solana and its Layer-2 counterpart. $SOLX reigns supreme. 🛸41M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/uEUXlekkL0 — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 27, 2025 Early adopters stake presale tokens for up to 98% APY, locking in gains before exchange listings spark potential price rallies. SUBBD Riding the tide of growing European regulatory clarity, SUBBD provides cross-chain bridges and staking incentives—perfect for those staking a claim on blockchain interoperability as the market matures. SUBBD shifts from meme coin roots, focusing on blockchain tools to strengthen creator-fan relationships through direct crypto interactions. The platform streamlines support and payments using crypto, cutting through traditional banking delays and middlemen fees for smoother transactions. A 20% staking reward offers long-term incentives, adding practical value rarely seen in new crypto projects aiming beyond hype. Unlike platforms requiring viral luck, SUBBD boosts creator visibility through consistent engagement while automating tasks like scheduling and messaging. Hiring help drains earnings—after fees, creators often keep just 30-40%, pushing demand for SUBBD’s cost-cutting tools. BTC Bull As the UK’s survey shows confidence in Bitcoin spreading like wildfire, BTC Bull captures that bullish momentum with leveraged exposure, letting traders amplify gains as mainstream interest roars to life. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) emerges as a novel Bitcoin-linked investment vehicle, rewarding holders with real BTC airdrops at key price milestones like $150K or $200K. The project’s presale surged past $6.5 million, driven by its unique incentive model that ties token ownership to Bitcoin’s price performance. At Bitcoin’s $250K milestone, BTCBULL plans an exclusive token airdrop, reserving 10% of its total supply for this event to boost long-term engagement. This hybrid reward system—combining Bitcoin and token distributions—positions BTCBULL as a speculative darling while hedging bets on BTC’s continued rally Ethereum Fueling decentralized finance across the continent, Ethereum stands tall as smart contract demand explodes; its network effect makes ETH a core holding for anyone betting on crypto’s next chapter. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade went live earlier this month, targeting smoother developer experience. The update follows rigorous testing, aiming to solidify Ethereum’s dominance in smart contracts. Vitalik Buterin argues Ethereum must mimic cash’s privacy and offline resilience, calling it a critical “fallback” as digital payments phase out physical money. Despite cash’s declining role, Buterin stresses the need for decentralized alternatives, urging Ethereum to bake in crash-resistant, private transaction features long-term. “Ethereum’s already ahead here,” he noted, acknowledging technical hurdles but highlighting progress in balancing complexity with real-world usability. In technical terms, it is currently trading at around $2725 with a market cap of $329 billion, securing its position in 2nd place. It has shown a 3.18% growth in the past 24 hours, suggesting that the saturation point is still far off, creating an opportunity for potential buyers to capitalize on upcoming opportunities. The push aligns with growing demand for systems that blend old-school cash traits with blockchain’s speed—a tightrope walk between innovation and tradition. As stated by well-known crypto YouTuber Cilinix Crypto , Ethereum is set to deliver parabolic returns. Conclusion Gemini’s report casts the United Kingdom as the unexpected leader in crypto adoption, reminding investors that regulatory lag doesn’t always throttle growth. Instead, Britain’s rise spotlights how market maturity and financial heritage can converge to accelerate mainstream uptake. As Europe finalizes MiCA and U.S. policy continues to influence global sentiment, the path ahead favors assets that balance institutional backing with vibrant retail interest.

2025-05-29T12:43:08.000Z,"While Bitcoin is in a Narrow Range, Whales' Behavior is Changing Remarkably! Here Are the Details","While the Bitcoin price has been trading sideways in a narrow range between $107,000 and $109,000, on-chain data reveals a notable shift in the behavior of “whales,” some of the largest and most influential participants in the market. Are Bitcoin Whales Signaling a Peak? According to the data, large investors may have moved from the accumulation phase to the distribution phase. The Accumulation Trend Score provided by Glassnode further illustrates this trend. This metric measures the accumulation power of investors based on the size of wallets and BTC purchases made in the last 15 days. Values close to 1 indicate strong buying, while values close to 0 indicate a selling trend. A more robust data set is obtained by excluding exchange and miner wallets from the analysis. The score of whales with assets of 10,000 BTC and above in this metric has currently dropped to 0.4. This level shows that whales have started to take sell positions after the aggressive buying levels of $75,000 in April. Other wallet categories are still in accumulation mode. This strategic change in direction by whales may be due to their desire to take profits or to take a more cautious stance on short-term price movements. Another indicator of this change comes from exchange flow data. While whales have been showing a positive picture over the last month, showing that they have not sold by withdrawing BTC from their wallets to exchanges, they have been seen to have deposited BTC back into exchanges in two of the last three days. This movement is generally known as a pattern observed before the sale. In light of these developments, Bitcoin continues to trade very close to its all-time highs, but whale behavior reinforces signals that the market could be entering a correction phase. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $2,700, up almost 4% over the past 24 hours, as buyers look to build momentum and push towards $3,000.

US Federal Court Blocks Trump Tariffs Futures surged early Thursday after a federal court pushed back President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. The US Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority when he imposed reciprocal tariffs and ordered the challenged tariff orders be vacated. Trump’s ever-changing approach towards tariffs and trade policies and concerns about inflation have spooked markets, with companies dialing back forecasts and traders adopting a wait-and-watch approach. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares jumped almost 5% during after-hours trading after the chipmaker exceeded expectations on its top and bottom lines for the first quarter, as its data center business registered a year-over-year growth of 73%. James Demmert, Chief Investment Officer of Main Street Research, stated, “Wednesday’s Nvidia earnings report is pivotal not just for Nvidia but for the entire stock market, as it can rejuvenate investor optimism across the board and help investors to focus on the power of AI and less on headlines out of Washington on tariffs and taxes.” Dow Registers Drop As Fed Minutes Rattle Markets US stocks closed lower Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve released minutes from its May policy meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Indices fell 0.56% and 0.51%. The Fed indicated a cautious approach to monetary policy and warned of “difficult tradeoffs” if inflation persisted. “Participants agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had increased further, making it appropriate to take a cautious approach until the net economic effects of the array of changes to government policies become clearer. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proves to be more persistent while the outlooks for growth and employment weaken.” Circle Freezes USDC Linked To LIBRA Scandal Circle has frozen nearly $58 million in USDC connected with the LIBRA memecoin scandal. Blockchain analysts from Arkham noted that Circle had frozen two Solana wallets linked with the LIBRA deployer and project team. Both wallets held a combined $57 million in USDC. Circle’s multisig freeze authority conducted the freeze. “ALERT: $57M OF USDC ASSOCIATED WITH LIBRA FROZEN BY CIRCLE Two Libra accounts have just been frozen by Circle, including the Libra deployer wallet. These accounts contained a combined $57M in USDC, which is now immobile.” The freeze is part of a class-action lawsuit filed in March in the Southern District of New York, with LIBRA investors suing Kelsier Ventures and its founders, Gideon, Thomas, and Hayden Davis. Benjamin Chow, a co-founder of Meteora, Julian Peh of KIP Protocol, and organizations that helped in the development and marketing of the LIBRA token are among the other defendants. Crypto Mining Stocks Plummet US crypto mining stocks dropped after minutes published by the Federal Reserve indicated growing uncertainty about the economy’s outlook. According to the minutes, the Fed may face a difficult tradeoff if inflation persists and the outlook for growth and employment weakens. The Fed has kept interest rates steady between 4.25% and 4.50% due to growing uncertainty about the economic outlook and an increase in the risk of higher unemployment and higher inflation. Riot Platforms closed the May 28 trading day down over 8%, while CleanSpark (CLSDK) fell 7.61%, and MARA Holdings dropped almost 10%. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) also fell 4.55%, while Michael Saylor’s Strategy extended its downtrend, dropping over 2%. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a notable decline on Wednesday, falling over 1% as it briefly dipped below $107,000 to an intraday low of $106,856 before reclaiming $107,000 and settling at $107,834. The flagship cryptocurrency’s price action has been subdued after last week’s rally, thanks to buyer exhaustion and profit-taking at higher levels. Despite BTC’s subdued price action this week, it is up nearly 15% over the past month. Additionally, analysts believe the overall sentiment around BTC remains positive despite a pullback to $107,000. CryptoQuant contributor Burak Kesmeci highlighted Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and the importance of the 365-day Simple Moving Average as a benchmark for the MVRV metric. Historically, when the MVRV crosses and maintains weekly closes above the SMA365, it indicates sustained upward momentum. Meanwhile, long-term BTC holders have transferred $4.02 billion in BTC, the largest spending volume from the 1-to-5-year cohorts since February 2025. The surge is driven by the 3-to-5-year cohort ($2.16 billion), the fifth-largest this cycle. The 2-to-3-year and 1-to-2-year cohorts contributed $1.41 billion and $450 million, respectively. BTC has traded in a narrow range between $105,000 and $110,000 since Friday as it consolidates close to its all-time high. However, its trend into price discovery remains intact, with analysts pointing out that the price is consolidating above previous highs. BTC ended the previous week in positive territory, rising over 3% and settling at $106,489. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,582. However, price action turned bearish on Friday, and BTC plunged nearly 4% to settle at $107,356. Source: TradingView Price action turned positive over the weekend as BTC 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,095. The current week started positively as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $109,453. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $108,951. Selling pressure intensified on Wednesday as BTC fell over 1% to a low of $106,856 before settling at $107,834. The current session sees BTC up nearly 1% as buyers look to build momentum and push the price toward $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $2,700 after registering an increase of nearly 5% in the past 24 hours as institutional interest in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency returned. The move past $2,700 sees ETH extend its impressive performance, with the price rising over 50% during the past month. ETH’s recovery comes after a difficult Q1, during which the asset’s price plummeted over 40%. Spot Ethereum ETFs have also attracted $402 million in inflows over the past month, according to data from SoSoValue. Industry leaders are pushing the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve staking for Ethereum ETFs. If the SEC approves these requests, Ethereum ETFs could register even more inflows. ETH’s recovery can also be credited to large-scale ETH purchases by institutions. Between May 7 and May 21, Abraxas Capital purchased over 350,000 ETH, worth around $837 million. The firm also transferred 185,000 ETH from centralized exchanges, indicating long-term conviction about the asset’s price. Trading firm DRW also made a $150 million investment in ETH in April, while online gambling firm SharpLink Gaming raised $425 million to establish an ETH treasury. ETH ended the previous weekend facing volatility and selling pressure but registered an increase of nearly 1% and settled at $2,498. The price fell to an intraday low of $2,349 on Monday before rebounding to register a rise of 1.18% and settle at $2,527. ETH registered a marginal decline on Tuesday but rebounded on Wednesday to register an increase of 1.10% despite volatility and selling pressure. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rose over 4% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,664. The price reached an intraday high of $2,731 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level, falling over 5% to $2,525. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH rebounded over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $2,551. ETH started the current week positively, registering a marginal increase and moving to $2,564. Buying pressure increased on Tuesday as ETH rose almost 4% to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,662. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as ETH rose nearly 1% and settled at $2,683. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,791 during the ongoing session before declining and moving to its current level of $2,720. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) faced rejection from the $180 level yet again, falling nearly 3% on Wednesday after reaching an intraday high of $179 a day prior. While SOL has been unsuccessful in establishing a sustained bullish position at this level, it has maintained a positive signal by crossing the 50-week exponential moving average for three consecutive weeks. SOL is still trading significantly lower than its all-time high. However, Coinglass data shows futures market activity remains robust, with SOL futures open interest at $7.5 billion, just 1 billion short of its $8.5 billion peak. High open interest indicates speculative interest, suggesting traders are positioning themselves for volatility. Funding rates have also turned negative, indicating a pivot towards short positions. While this reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the potential of a short squeeze. SOL started the previous week in the red, dropping nearly 4% to $166. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, SOL rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.05% and settling at $168. The price continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising almost 3% to cross $170 and settling at $173. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL registered an increase of nearly 4% and settled at $179. SOL raced to an intraday day high of $187 on Friday as buying pressure increased.

The current session sees SOL marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Chainlink (LINK) registered a steep decline on Monday (May 19), as it plunged to an intraday low of $14.85 before rebounding to settle at $15.78, ultimately registering a marginal decline.

2025-05-29T12:34:21.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is BTC’s Rally Sustainable or Due for a Pullback?","Bitcoin continues to hold around the $108,000 mark, consolidating within a narrow range after a sharp rally from April lows. Price action suggests strength, but momentum has cooled slightly, setting the stage for a critical few days ahead. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC remains above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are located in the $90,000 – $96,000 range, and have also crossed bullishly in recent weeks. The RSI sits around 63, showing that the rally isn’t yet overheated but is nearing the upper range. A healthy consolidation around the $108,000 level could serve as a base for another leg up, provided bullish momentum holds and volume supports a breakout. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows a rising channel structure, and despite a recent breakdown of the lower trendline, the price has convincingly defended the horizontal support level at $106,000. This area has now become an intraday support zone. The RSI is around the neutral 50 level, suggesting balanced momentum after a brief correction. A clean break and close above $109,000 and a return inside the channel could trigger a push towards the $112,000–115,000 range, while any breakdown below $106,000 might open the door for a short-term pullback toward the $102,000–$100,000 region. Sentiment Analysis Exchange Reserve On-chain data continues to support a bullish bias. Exchange reserves are at their lowest level in years, now sitting around 2.4 million BTC. This sustained and aggressive decline reinforces the idea that investors are moving BTC off exchanges, likely for long-term storage, reducing sell-side liquidity. With supply tightening and price climbing, the conditions remain ripe for higher valuations, especially if macro conditions stay favorable and demand from institutional channels remains strong.

2025-05-29T12:30:38.000Z,"US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: $433.66M Added in Powerful 10-Day Streak","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: $433.66M Added in Powerful 10-Day Streak Guess what’s happening in the world of digital assets? The US Spot Bitcoin ETF market is absolutely buzzing! After a period of mixed sentiment, these investment vehicles are once again attracting significant capital, signaling renewed confidence among investors. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows According to data shared by Trader T on X, May 28 saw a remarkable influx into US-based spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The total net inflow for the day reached an impressive $433.66 million . This isn’t just a one-off event; it extends a notable trend that has been building momentum. This figure represents the tenth consecutive trading day where these ETFs have seen more money flow in than out. A ten-day streak is a strong indicator of sustained buying pressure and potentially shifting market dynamics. It suggests that demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure through these familiar investment products remains robust. Let’s break down the key players in this latest inflow report: BlackRock’s IBIT: Once again, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the pack, recording substantial inflows of $482 million . IBIT has consistently been a dominant force since its launch, quickly accumulating billions in assets under management. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Not all funds saw positive movement. ARK Invest’s ARKB experienced outflows totaling $34.29 million on May 28. Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also saw a net outflow, albeit smaller, amounting to $14.05 million . Other BTC ETF Products: The report indicated that other existing US Spot Bitcoin ETF products recorded no significant change in their holdings for the day. This snapshot shows a clear divergence, with BlackRock’s IBIT continuing to attract significant capital, while some others faced minor redemptions. However, the overall net figure remains strongly positive due to IBIT’s large inflow. Why Does This 10-Day Streak of BTC ETF Inflows Matter? A consistent streak of inflows, especially one reaching ten consecutive days, is highly significant for several reasons: Sustained Demand: It indicates that institutional and retail investors are consistently buying into these funds, rather than just making sporadic investments. This suggests underlying confidence. Market Support: Every dollar flowing into a spot Bitcoin ETF theoretically requires the fund manager to purchase an equivalent amount of actual Bitcoin on the open market. This creates consistent buying pressure, which can provide support for Bitcoin’s price. Growing Adoption: The sustained inflows underscore the increasing adoption of Bitcoin as an asset class through traditional investment channels like ETFs. This is a major step towards mainstream acceptance. Liquidity and Maturity: As these funds grow larger, they add liquidity to the Bitcoin market and contribute to its overall maturity as an asset class. While $433.66 million is a substantial daily figure, the real story is the endurance of the inflow trend. It suggests a potential shift in sentiment following previous periods of outflows or sideways movement. How Does BlackRock IBIT Continue to Dominate the Crypto ETF Landscape? BlackRock’s IBIT has been a standout performer since the launch of the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Its ability to consistently attract the largest share of inflows warrants a closer look. Several factors likely contribute to IBIT’s success: Brand Recognition: BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager with a long-standing reputation in traditional finance. This provides a level of trust and familiarity that appeals to large institutional investors and financial advisors. Distribution Network: BlackRock has an extensive distribution network, making it easier for financial professionals and their clients to access IBIT. Liquidity: Due to its large asset base and trading volume, IBIT is highly liquid, which is attractive to large investors who need to enter and exit positions efficiently. Competitive Fees: While fees vary, IBIT’s fee structure is competitive within the spot Bitcoin ETF market. The dominance of BlackRock IBIT highlights how traditional finance players entering the crypto space can quickly capture significant market share, leveraging their existing infrastructure and reputation. What Do These US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Mean for the Future? The continued positive trend in US Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows is generally seen as a bullish signal for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Here are some potential implications and things to watch: Potential Benefits: Price Appreciation: Sustained buying pressure from ETFs can help drive Bitcoin’s price higher. Increased Legitimacy: Growing assets under management in these regulated products further legitimizes Bitcoin as a viable investment asset. Wider Investor Base: ETFs make it easier for a broader range of investors, including those in retirement accounts or traditional brokerage platforms, to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Potential Challenges & Considerations: Market Volatility: While inflows are positive, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. ETF flows can reverse, leading to selling pressure. Correlation: The performance of BTC ETFs is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin. Investors are still exposed to the asset’s price swings. Dependence on Macro Factors: Bitcoin’s price and ETF flows can still be influenced by broader economic conditions and regulatory news. Actionable Insight: Investors interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated means should monitor these inflow trends closely, but also consider the broader market context and their own risk tolerance. Diversification remains key. Concluding Thoughts on the Powerful Inflow Streak The streak of ten consecutive days of net inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs, culminating in a strong $433.66 million day on May 28, is a significant development. It underscores the enduring appeal of Bitcoin as an asset and the growing importance of regulated investment vehicles like the Crypto ETF in providing access to it. While individual funds like ARK Invest’s ARKB and Fidelity’s FBTC saw minor outflows, the overall picture, heavily influenced by the consistent strength of BlackRock IBIT, is one of positive momentum. This trend provides fundamental support for Bitcoin and signals increasing integration of digital assets into traditional finance.

2025-05-29T12:20:35.000Z,"Bitcoin-Backed Loans Revolutionizing Real Estate and Golf Entertainment via SALT Lending Deal","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin-Backed Loans Revolutionizing Real Estate and Golf Entertainment via SALT Lending Deal Imagine accessing significant capital for your business without selling off your valuable digital assets. That’s the power of Bitcoin-backed loans , and a recent announcement involving SALT Lending is putting this concept into the mainstream spotlight in a big way. Unpacking the Groundbreaking SALT Lending Deal In a move that highlights the increasing convergence of digital assets and traditional finance, SALT Lending , a prominent provider of loans collateralized by cryptocurrencies, has inked a significant letter of intent (LOI). This agreement is set to provide a substantial $105 million in Bitcoin-backed financing to two distinct companies: GolfSuites 1 Inc. and ERC Communities 1 Inc. This isn’t just a small pilot program; it’s a nine-figure commitment demonstrating serious confidence in using Bitcoin as collateral for large-scale business ventures. The funding is strategically allocated: $35 million is earmarked for GolfSuites 1 Inc. This capital will fuel the expansion of their golf-entertainment facilities, a growing sector that blends sports, leisure, and social experiences. $70 million is designated for ERC Communities 1 Inc. This larger portion will support the development of build-to-rent manufactured-home communities, addressing a significant need in the real estate market for attainable housing solutions. Shawn Owen, CEO of SALT Lending, emphasized the significance of this deal, stating, “This transaction exemplifies how bitcoin can unlock growth in mainstream industries like golf entertainment and attainable housing.” His statement underscores the potential for digital assets to serve as powerful financial tools beyond speculative trading. How Do Bitcoin-Backed Loans Work? The Over-Collateralization Model A key element mentioned in the announcement is the use of an over-collateralized Bitcoin structure . But what exactly does that mean, and why is it used? In simple terms, over-collateralization means the borrower puts up more value in Bitcoin than the amount of fiat currency (like USD) they receive as a loan. For example, to borrow $100,000, a borrower might need to pledge $150,000 or $200,000 worth of Bitcoin. Here’s why this structure is crucial, especially in the world of crypto lending : Mitigating Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly. Over-collateralization provides a buffer against potential price drops. If the value of the pledged Bitcoin falls, the lender is still protected because the collateral’s initial value was significantly higher than the loan amount. Protecting Lenders and Investors: This buffer protects the lender (SALT Lending) and the investors who fund these loans. It reduces the risk of the collateral value falling below the outstanding loan amount, which could result in losses. Ensuring Loan Security: By requiring more collateral than the loan value, the lender has a higher degree of security. If the borrower defaults, the lender can liquidate the collateral to recover the loan amount, even if the asset’s price has decreased. Facilitating Access to Capital: For the borrower, this structure allows them to access needed capital without selling their Bitcoin. This is particularly attractive for individuals or businesses who are bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term value and don’t want to incur capital gains taxes or lose potential future appreciation. The level of over-collateralization (often expressed as a Loan-to-Value or LTV ratio) varies depending on the lender, the volatility of the asset, and market conditions. Lower LTVs (meaning higher over-collateralization) offer greater safety for the lender but require the borrower to tie up more capital. Why Choose Digital Asset Lending Over Traditional Finance? For companies like GolfSuites and ERC Communities, tapping into digital asset lending might offer several compelling advantages over traditional bank loans: Speed and Flexibility: Crypto lending platforms can often process loan applications and disburse funds much faster than traditional banks, which can be crucial for time-sensitive business opportunities. Access to Capital Without Selling Assets: This is perhaps the biggest draw. Businesses holding significant amounts of Bitcoin or other digital assets can leverage them for liquidity without triggering taxable events or sacrificing potential future gains from holding the asset. Potentially Broader Eligibility: Traditional lenders may have rigid criteria. Crypto lending platforms might offer more flexible terms or access to capital for businesses that find it difficult to secure traditional financing. Diversification of Funding Sources: Relying on a mix of traditional and digital asset financing can be a smart business strategy, providing alternative avenues for capital. This deal signals a growing acceptance of digital assets as legitimate forms of collateral in the financial world, opening up new funding avenues for businesses in diverse sectors. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the benefits are clear, Bitcoin-backed loans and crypto lending , in general, are not without their risks: Volatility Risk: Although over-collateralization helps, a drastic and rapid drop in Bitcoin’s price can still lead to margin calls (requiring the borrower to add more collateral) or even liquidation of the collateral if the LTV ratio crosses a certain threshold. Liquidation Risk: Losing your pledged Bitcoin due to price drops is a significant risk. If your collateral is liquidated, you lose your Bitcoin holdings. Platform Risk: Borrowers rely on the lending platform’s security and reliability. Hacks, operational failures, or regulatory issues could impact the loan or the safety of the collateral. Interest Rates: Interest rates on crypto loans can sometimes be higher than traditional loans, depending on market conditions and the specific platform. Businesses considering this type of financing must have a clear understanding of these risks and a strategy for managing potential volatility, such as maintaining a healthy collateral buffer well above the liquidation threshold. Real Estate and Golf Entertainment: Unexpected Beneficiaries? It might seem counterintuitive to see industries like real estate development and golf entertainment tapping into Bitcoin-backed financing. However, this deal illustrates a key point: capital is capital, regardless of its source. For businesses in capital-intensive sectors, accessing $105 million can be transformative for expansion and development plans. The real estate sector, in particular, is always seeking innovative financing solutions. Build-to-rent communities require significant upfront investment, and leveraging digital assets provides an alternative funding path. Similarly, expanding entertainment venues demands substantial capital, and this deal shows that even leisure industries are exploring new financial frontiers. This trend of traditional industries utilizing digital asset lending is likely to continue as awareness and acceptance of cryptocurrencies grow within the broader financial ecosystem. The Future of Digital Asset Lending The SALT Lending deal is more than just a one-off transaction; it’s a sign of maturation in the crypto lending space. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional confidence builds, we can expect to see more diverse businesses and industries exploring the potential of using digital assets as collateral. This could include everything from small business loans to large corporate financing, all powered by the value stored in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The infrastructure for managing, valuing, and securing digital assets for lending purposes is becoming more robust, paving the way for broader adoption. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Bitcoin in Mainstream Finance SALT Lending’s commitment to provide $105 million in Bitcoin-backed loans for real estate and golf entertainment marks a significant milestone. It clearly demonstrates the growing utility of Bitcoin as a legitimate financial tool capable of unlocking substantial capital for businesses in traditional sectors. While risks associated with volatility remain, the over-collateralization model provides a framework for managing these challenges. This deal is a compelling example of how digital asset lending is bridging the gap between the crypto world and the broader economy, creating new opportunities for growth and investment across diverse industries. It’s a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role beyond a speculative asset, positioning it as a key player in the future of finance.

In January 2024, the crypto OTC infrastructure firm Finery Markets reported that institutional OTC volumes jumped 106% last year.Cointelegraph approached Hidden Road for comment regarding the estimated OTC volumes globally and in the US, but had not received a response by the time of publication.Rising institutional demandIn December 2024, Higgins highlighted a rising demand for institutional balance sheets from large institutions in an interview with Finance Magnates.“Servicing them [institutional investors] across traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems that have already converged presents a really unique opportunity for us in the marketplace.”Hidden Road’s OTC swap launch in the US marks one of the first products launched by the firm since the company entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by Ripple.Related: Taurus, Parfin partnership to provide crypto infrastructure to institutionsSoon after the deal was announced, Hidden Road received a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private US corporation and self-regulatory organization regulating member brokerage firms and exchange markets.Hidden Road is also known as one of the first companies to receive a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe, immediately after the framework entered into full force on Dec. 30, 2024.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Ethereum Foundation turns to DeFi for cash","The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has borrowed $2 million in GHO, a decentralized stablecoin developed by Aave, in a move signaling deeper engagement with decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.  In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

CEO Leah Wald said the move supports the company’s long-term growth plans.“The filing of a base shelf prospectus supports our growth strategy by providing us with the flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem,” she said.Source: Sol StrategiesIn a May 28 announcement, Solana treasury firm DeFi Dev announced its adoption of Solana liquid staking tokens. The firm will now divert part of its Solana holdings to the liquid staking token dfdvSOL.The announcement followed DeFi Dev’s addition of 88,164 SOL to its treasury in late April, valued at $11.5 million at the time, when it held $34.4 million worth of Solana (SOL).Related: Solana chart hints at 180% rally to $300 if key technical trend holdsWhat is liquid staking?Liquid staking allows tokenholders to earn staking rewards without locking up their assets. Instead, they receive a liquid token that can be traded or used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  DeFi Dev expects the adoption of this technology to “enhance the company’s validator operations and treasury management, consistent with its mission to maximize SOL Per Share” growth. Chief investment officer and chief operating officer Parker White said:The adoption of dfdvSOL not only creates additional ways to drive stake to our validators and increase SOL holdings, but also advances our role as a long-term participant in the Solana ecosystem.”Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard CharteredSol Strategies prepares to safeguard capitalSol Strategies also announced on May 28 that it had completed several key audits and certifications. The company passed SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1 audits and received ISO 27001 certification for its Solana staking platform.  SOC 2 Type 1 is a report assessing a company’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy at a specific point in time. Such an audit verifies that the firm’s controls meet trust service criteria at the time of the check.SOC 1 Type 1 is a similar report focused on internal controls over financial reporting at a specific point in time. This audit evaluates whether the controls are appropriately designed, but does not assess their effectiveness over time.Lastly, ISO 27001 is an international standard specifying requirements for an information security management system. These standards help manage risks pertaining to data confidentiality, integrity and availability through a continuous improvement framework.To obtain this ISO certificate, a company must demonstrate both the documentation and implementation of controls. Sol Strategies’ Wald explained that all these measures are meant to ensure institutional trust:“By achieving SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1, alongside our ISO 27001 certification, we’ve demonstrated that institutional clients can trust SOL Strategies with their Solana staking needs.”The compliance efforts come as the firm continues to position itself as a major Solana validator.

At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion.Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did,” Arkham wrote, adding that the amount represents 87.5% of the total Bitcoin holdings of Strategy. Cointelegraph reached out to Arkham and Strategy for comment but had not received a response by publication time.  Source: Arkham IntelligenceStrategy chairman says publishing addresses “not a good idea” Arkam’s claims follow comments from Saylor about the risks of publishing wallet addresses. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Saylor said that publishing wallet addresses is dangerous for companies holding Bitcoin. “No institutional grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth,” Saylor said. The executive said making wallets public allows every future transaction to be scrutinized, exposing a company to risks that may not be immediately apparent. To highlight his point, Saylor suggested using artificial intelligence to explore the issue. Saylor said if a user puts AI in deep think mode and asks about security problems associated with publishing wallet addresses, the executive said the response could get “50 pages” of security problems.Related: Metaplanet issues $21M in bonds to buy Bitcoin, a day after $50M raiseArkham previously accused of mislabelling walletsWhile blockchain data is publicly available, the accuracy of claims related to wallet ownership has been questioned before. At the height of the Mantra token collapse, Mantra CEO John Mullin denied accusations of insiders dumping their token.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share.

Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin’s failure to maintain above the $109,588 level may have attracted selling by short-term traders. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000 and later to the pattern target of $3,153.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($2,467). The failure of a bullish setup may trap the aggressive bulls, sinking the pair to $2,323 and below that to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been trading between the moving averages, indicating a lack of aggressive buying or selling.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($2.33) and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price dips below the 50-day SMA ($2.24), the XRP/USDT pair could dive to the $2 support. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61.On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA opens the gates for a rally to $2.65. Buyers will have to drive the pair above $2.65 to catapult the price to $3.BNB price predictionBuyers pushed BNB (BNB) above the $693 resistance on May 27 but could not sustain the higher levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe price action of the past few days has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $693. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could rally toward the pattern target of $752.The 20-day EMA ($658) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could accelerate selling as the aggressive bulls may cover their positions. That could tug the pair to the 50-day SMA ($622).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) has been consolidating inside a narrow range between the 20-day EMA ($169) and the overhead resistance at $180.SOL/USDT daily chart.

The SOL/USDT pair could descend to $159 and later to the 50-day SMA ($153), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the pair could swing between $153 and $180 for some time.A break and close above $180 signals the resumption of the up move. The pair could pick up momentum and rally to the $210 to $220 resistance zone.Dogecoin price predictionSellers are trying to pull Dogecoin (DOGE) below the immediate support at the 20-day EMA ($0.22).DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the horizontal support at $0.21.

Such a move brings the large $0.14 to $0.26 range into play.On the contrary, a rebound off $0.21 suggests the bulls are vigorously defending the level. That could keep the pair inside the $0.21 to $0.26 range for a few more days.Cardano price predictionBuyers have managed to keep Cardano (ADA) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern, but the bounce lacks strength.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThat increases the risk of a break below the 50-day SMA ($0.70). If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to the solid support at $0.60.

If they can pull it off, the pair may rally to the $3.90 to $4.25 overhead zone.On the other hand, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests that the bears remain in control.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($15.66) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved.

2025-05-28T13:00:00.000Z,"Former Chainlink, Two Sigma execs build ‘Moirai’ to uncover crypto gems","Metalayer Ventures, a crypto-focused venture capital firm led by former executives from Chainlink and Two Sigma, has launched a $25 million fund to invest in early-stage blockchain projects with a focus on stablecoins, tokenization and cryptocurrency infrastructure. Metalayer’s fund has already backed seven companies, the company disclosed to Cointelegraph on May 28. These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe relative strength index (RSI) has climbed to 47 from 31 on April 8, indicating that bullish momentum is building up.However, to sustain the ongoing recovery, XRP’s price has to first hold the support at $2.20 and then overcome the resistance between $2.60 and $2.80.Several analysts are optimistic about a rebound higher, with pseudonymous trader Cryptowzrd saying that a validation of a falling wedge could see XRP break out toward $2.90.“$XRP closed indecisively and is still maintaining a falling wedge formation,” the trader wrote in a May 28 post on X, adding: “A breakout of this wedge will push markets toward the $2.80 resistance.

2025-05-28T09:59:06.000Z,"Fungible cryptos in secondary sales are not securities, Ripple tells SEC","Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP, argued that fungible cryptocurrencies are not securities when transferred in secondary transactions in a recent letter sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In its May 27 letter, Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
