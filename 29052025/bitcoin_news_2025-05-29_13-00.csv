2025-05-29T10:55:28.000Z,"Michael Saylor Targets $10 Trillion Valuation for Strategy with Bold Bitcoin Bet","The post Michael Saylor Targets $10 Trillion Valuation for Strategy with Bold Bitcoin Bet appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News What if your $10,000 investment could turn into $1 million? That’s the kind of bold future MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor envisions and he’s betting big on it. The company, now rebranded as Strategy (MSTR), has transformed into one of the most aggressive Bitcoin investment plays on the market. With its stock soaring 1,600% over the last three years, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 42%, Strategy has gone from a business software firm to a full-on Bitcoin powerhouse. Here’s what’s driving the excitement – and what could bring it all down. Saylor’s $10 Trillion Vision Rides on Bitcoin’s Future Saylor , now Strategy’s executive chairman, says the company could eventually hit a $10 trillion market cap – a 100x leap from where it stands today. His bold forecast depends entirely on Bitcoin. Strategy currently holds 580,250 BTC, valued at about $62 billion with Bitcoin trading around $107,000. Saylor believes Bitcoin could reach $1 million in the next decade, turning Strategy into one of the most valuable companies on the planet. If he’s right, a $10,000 investment today could become $1 million. That kind of upside has drawn in crypto believers who see Strategy as the ultimate way to get leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s rise. The Cost of Going All-In on Bitcoin But there’s more to the story than moonshot predictions. Despite its massive stock gains, Strategy reported a $5.3 billion net loss over the past four quarters. Its revenues have been slipping, and its original software business has taken a backseat. The company is also facing a class-action lawsuit, with accusations that it misled investors about its Bitcoin-first strategy. These issues raise serious questions about long-term sustainability. Strategy’s valuation doesn’t follow traditional stock metrics. It moves with Bitcoin’s price and that makes it extremely volatile. If Bitcoin drops, Strategy’s stock could take a massive hit. Why Stock Experts Are Steering Clear Even with the hype, not everyone’s buying in. The Motley Fool’s Stock Advisor recently listed their top 10 stock picks – and Strategy wasn’t one of them. Instead, they’re favoring long-term winners like Netflix, which has returned over 653,000% since 2004, and Nvidia, which has soared more than 830,000% since 2005. This shows that while Strategy might offer big upside, many experts see safer ways to build wealth. Blockchain Transparency: Arkham Maps Strategy’s Wallets Strategy has long kept its Bitcoin holdings under wraps – until now. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence says it has identified 87.5% of Strategy’s wallets, totaling over 400,000 BTC spread across 491 addresses. This includes 327,000 BTC held via Coinbase Prime, and 107,000 BTC possibly with Fidelity, though those are harder to confirm due to shared custody setups. On May 26, Arkham tracked a fresh 4,020 BTC purchase in real time – proof that Strategy’s once-private operations are now out in the open. While this level of transparency boosts trust, it also raises concerns. Public wallet exposure opens the door to risks like dusting attacks and privacy breaches. It could also limit the “surprise” factor in big announcements that often move the stock price. Bitcoin-Powered, But Vulnerable Over the past year, Strategy’s stock has outperformed Bitcoin. But with its entire value tied to BTC, even a minor dip could cause serious damage. Meanwhile, other companies like Japan’s Metaplanet are taking a different route – holding Bitcoin with simpler, more transparent custody. In contrast, Strategy’s structure across multiple custodians and complex wallets can make it harder for investors to fully understand what they’re buying into. Interestingly, despite the chaos, Strategy’s preferred shares (STRK) have climbed past $102 – a six-month high – while its common stock has dropped to around $364.52, closely following Bitcoin’s recent pullback. Strategy’s dream of reaching a $10 trillion valuation depends entirely on Bitcoin’s long-term success. For high-risk investors chasing big rewards, this could be the ultimate crypto proxy play. But for others, the growing losses, lawsuits, and wallet exposure make it a much riskier ride.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/michael-saylor-targets-10-trillion-valuation-for-strategy-with-bold-bitcoin-bet/,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|ARKM","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T10:45:10.000Z,"SOL Strategies plans to buy more Solana with $1 billion","SOL Strategies, a publicly traded Solana infrastructure company, has announced plans to raise $1 billion. The firm disclosed today that it has filed a preliminary prospectus with regulators to disclose its intention. According to the announcement, the company filed the prospectus with securities regulators in all the Canadian provinces and territories. This is only a first step, as regulators will only approve once they have received and acknowledged the final base shelf prospectus. Based on the prospectus, SOL Strategies wants to issue up to $1 billion in securities over the next 25 months. The company noted that it can do so through common shares, warrants, debt securities, units, or subscription receipts. However, it noted that there is no final decision yet on whether it wants to issue these securities, and it only filed the preliminary prospectus to improve its flexibility if it decides to go ahead with the plan later. The announcement reads: “The Company has filed this Preliminary Shelf Prospectus to increase its financial flexibility going forward. SOL Strategies currently has no immediate plans to issue any securities under it and may never proceed with any such issuance.” SOL Strategies added if it decides to offer the securities, its final base shelf prospectus would contain all the terms and how it intends to use the proceeds of the raised funds. The company CEO, Leah Wald, also confirmed this, noting that the filing aligns with its growth strategy and allows it to access capital for any opportunity within the Solana ecosystem. SOL Strategies remains bullish on Solana Meanwhile, SOL Strategies’ plan reflects its bullishness on SOL. The company, formerly Cypherpunk Holdings, recently bought 122,524 SOL for $18.25 million using the initial $20 million of its $500 million convertible note facility. With that acquisition, its total holdings increased to 349,322 SOL. Beyond acquiring SOL, the company also offers enterprise-grade Solana validator services, allowing it to stake SOL for several companies. According to the firm, it has around 3.5 million SOL delegated to its validators, with more than 5,500 wallets controlled by different corporate institutions staking with it. Due to its staking services, it has also invested heavily in security and compliance. It recently completed SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1 audits for its staking platform while getting an ISO 27001 certification. The certifications confirm the company’s cybersecurity and compliance standards. Interestingly, the company has also announced plans to bring tokenized shares of its stock to Solana. In a post earlier this month, SOL Strategies stated that it is working to become the first public company to have registered shares on Solana through the Superstate Opening Bell platform. SOL Treasury adoption is growing The $1 billion plan by SOL Strategies highlights the trend of SOL treasury adoption by public companies copying Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) approach with Bitcoin. Over the past month, two US-based public companies have adopted SOL. These include Nasdaq-listed real estate company Janover, which recently changed its name to DeFi Development Corp. The firm now holds 251,842 SOL after spending $11.5 million to buy 88,164 SOL in April, and it is also planning to operate a staking service on Solana. Interestingly, the company filed a registration statement to raise $1 billion through securities offering and spend the proceeds on SOL. While a real estate firm pivoting to Solana acquisition and staking might seem strange, it is not without explanation. A group of former executives of the crypto exchange Kraken recently took a majority stake in the company. Meanwhile, another Nasdaq-listed firm, Upexi, announced last month that it had raised $100 million to buy SOL and create a Solana treasury. At the same time, Japanese firm Remixpoint also holds SOL as a treasury asset.

2025-05-29T10:30:27.000Z,"Elon Musk Concludes Crucial Government Efficiency Role","BitcoinWorld Elon Musk Concludes Crucial Government Efficiency Role Known for his significant presence in the technology and finance worlds, including frequent commentary on cryptocurrency markets like Dogecoin, Elon Musk recently made an announcement that, while related to government work, carries an acronym familiar to the crypto community: DOGE. However, this DOGE refers to the Department of Government Efficiency. The Tesla CEO has confirmed his tenure in this initiative is concluding, a move that sparks discussion about private sector involvement in public administration. Elon Musk’s Role in Government Efficiency What exactly was Elon Musk doing in a government capacity? According to his post on X, he served as a special government employee tasked with leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This initiative’s primary goal was to identify and reduce waste within U.S. government operations. It’s a mission that aligns, in principle, with the efficiency drives often seen in the private sector, where resource optimization is key to profitability. Musk’s involvement brought a high-profile, unconventional perspective to the often bureaucratic world of government. His background running complex, large-scale operations like Tesla and SpaceX suggests a focus on streamlined processes, technological integration, and potentially disruptive approaches to problem-solving. The idea was likely to leverage this experience to tackle inefficiencies within federal agencies. Acknowledging Donald Trump and the DOGE Mission In his announcement, Elon Musk specifically expressed gratitude to U.S. President Donald Trump for the opportunity to serve. This highlights the political context of the initiative, framing it as part of the previous administration’s efforts to reform government operations. The establishment of DOGE under Trump aimed to deliver on promises of reducing the size and cost of the federal government. Musk noted that the impact of DOGE is expected to continue and even expand. This suggests that while his personal involvement is ending, the structures, recommendations, or processes initiated during his tenure are designed to have a lasting effect. It points towards a vision where the pursuit of Government Efficiency is not a one-off project but an ongoing transformation. Why is the Tesla CEO Stepping Down? The announcement from Elon Musk did not detail the specific reasons for his departure, framing it simply as his tenure coming to a close. Given Musk’s demanding schedule managing multiple major companies – Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), Neuralink, and The Boring Company – it’s plausible that the commitment required for a significant government efficiency role became difficult to sustain long-term. Special government employee roles often have defined terms or objectives. His exit marks the end of a unique collaboration between a prominent private sector figure and a government initiative. While the full scope of DOGE’s work under Musk hasn’t been widely publicized, the stated aim of reducing waste remains a perpetual challenge and goal for governments worldwide. The Broader Goal: Improving Government Efficiency The concept of Government Efficiency is a critical topic in public administration. It involves ensuring that public resources (taxpayer money, personnel, time) are used effectively and without unnecessary waste. Achieving this can lead to numerous benefits: Cost Savings: Reducing redundant programs, streamlining procurement, and cutting administrative overhead can save billions of dollars. Improved Services: Efficient processes can lead to faster delivery of public services, better citizen experiences, and more effective program outcomes. Increased Accountability: Clearer processes and reduced waste can make government operations more transparent and accountable to the public. Better Resource Allocation: Savings from efficiency gains can be redirected to fund essential services or reduce the tax burden. However, implementing significant efficiency reforms in government faces substantial challenges: Bureaucratic Inertia: Large organizations are often resistant to change. Political Obstacles: Reforms can face opposition from various stakeholders, including agencies, unions, or political groups. Complexity: Government programs and regulations are inherently complex, making simple solutions difficult to find and implement. Defining ‘Efficiency’: Measuring and defining efficiency in public services, where profit is not the metric, can be subjective. Musk’s involvement, though brief, highlights the potential for external perspectives to challenge existing norms and identify areas for improvement within this complex landscape. The DOGE Acronym: A Nod to the Crypto World? While the article clearly states DOGE stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, the acronym’s overlap with the popular cryptocurrency Dogecoin is noteworthy, especially given Musk’s history of influencing the crypto market through his tweets and commentary. It’s unclear if the acronym choice was deliberate or coincidental, but it certainly added an unexpected layer of interest for the crypto community when the initiative was first mentioned. For crypto enthusiasts, the name immediately brings to mind digital assets rather than government departments, creating a moment of crossover between two very different worlds that Elon Musk inhabits. Looking Ahead After Elon Musk’s Departure With Elon Musk concluding his role, the focus shifts to how the Department of Government Efficiency will continue its work. The success of the initiative will depend on whether the foundations laid during his tenure, and presumably by others involved, can be built upon within the existing government structure. The challenge remains implementing lasting change that genuinely reduces waste and improves operations across diverse federal agencies. Musk’s brief foray into this specific government role is another example of his multifaceted public profile, blending his identity as a pioneering Tesla CEO and tech entrepreneur with occasional forays into policy discussion and advisory roles. While his direct involvement in DOGE is over, the conversation about leveraging private sector insights for public benefit, and the ongoing pursuit of government efficiency, will undoubtedly continue. Summary Elon Musk has announced the conclusion of his tenure as a special government employee leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Thanking Donald Trump for the opportunity, the Tesla CEO indicated that the initiative’s impact on reducing government waste is set to continue and expand. While the acronym DOGE holds a different meaning in the crypto world, this role focused squarely on public administration reform. Musk’s departure highlights the complexities of balancing private sector leadership with government service and leaves questions about the future trajectory of the efficiency program he helped initiate.

2025-05-29T10:26:19.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Shows Strength as BCMI Signals Early Accumulation Phase","The post Bitcoin Price Shows Strength as BCMI Signals Early Accumulation Phase appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new update from crypto analyst Woominkyu highlights a sharp rebound in the Bitcoin Combined Market Index. This suggests that the Bitcoin market may be entering an early accumulation phase. With improving sentiment and reduced profit-taking, on-chain indicators are flashing a potential upside signal for Bitcoin investors. Here is what you should know. What is BCMI? Bitcoin Combined Market Index (BCMI), developed and popularized by on-chain analyst Woominkyu, is a composite indicator designed to assess the overall market sentiment and cycle stage of Bitcoin using four key on-chain metrics (MVRV, NUPL, SOPR, and Fear & Greed Index). Market Value to Realised Value compares Bitcoin’s current market price to the average price at which all coins were bought. Net Unrealised Profit/Loss measures the overall profit or loss of Bitcoin holders. Spent Output Profit Ratio tracks if coins being moved are in profit or loss. Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment index that reflects investor emotions. The BCMI reading below 0.15 indicates that the market is in the extreme fear zone. This is often seen near macro bottoms, when prices are low and sentiment is negative. The reading above 0.75 suggests that the market is in the state of Euphoria. This is seen at cycle tops, when prices are high and greed is rampant. BCMI: Analysing the Current Status According to Woominkyu’s analysis, the 7-day SMA of BCMI stands at 0.6 and the 90-day SMA of BCMI at 0.45. The rebound of the short-term average, especially in light of recent market corrections, suggests growing investor confidence supported by increased transaction volume and stronger on-chain fundamentals and possible early signs of a bull phase, Meanwhile, the stability of the long-term average suggests that the market is stable, not overheated. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Peter Schiff Blames Himself for Bitcoin Boom: “You Buy Every Time I Say Don’t” , What BCMI Indicates about the Current Trend? Investor sentiment is improving, supported by a drop in exchange outflows and long-term holder accumulation, while profit-taking has declined, as indicated by the decreasing Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). This sets the stage for an accumulation phase, where institutional or savvy investors start buying while prices are still relatively low. In the last seven days, the Bitcoin market has reported a decline of 1.9%. In the last 24 hours alone, the market has plummeted by 0.3%. Recently, the Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high of $111,980 , surpassing its previous ATH of $108,786 recorded in January 2025. Currently, the BTC price sits at $108,492.71 – at least 3.11% below the ATH recorded on May 22, 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-29T10:25:17.000Z,"GOAT Network launches dashboard for first suite of on-chain Bitcoin yield products","GOAT Network has officially launched its Bitcoin Yield Dashboard to accommodate its various on-chain BTC yield products, allowing users to reap rewards directly from the asset. At Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, the network unveiled the world’s first BTC ( BTC ) Yield Dashboard. At press time, the project remains one of the only blockchains to offer Bitcoin yield products that generate rewards for traders directly from the asset, without requiring centralized custody or mining rigs. According to the official press release sent to crypto.news, the dashboard serves to grant users access to the network’s range of BTC yield products, consisting of GOAT Safebox, BTCB/DOGEB Vault, Sequencer PoS Staking and BTC Lending. Users can access the new dashboard through the official website . Dubbed “the Gateway to BTCFi,” the dashboard is now live, providing information for all four BTC yield products offered on the network. Users can browse through the products by filtering them based on risk level, time frame and experience level. You might also like: Solv integrates Chainlink Proof of Reserve for BTC and RWA yield products For “BTC maximalists” or traders that prefer to only trade in BTC, the network offers a non-custodial yield product that offers them annual percentage yield of 2% on native BTC. Through GOAT Safebox, users are able to lock up their BTC for three months and generate yield. The product does not require traders to engage in bridges or expose themselves to other elements of DeFi . On the other hand, the network also supports holders of Dogecoin ( DOGE ) by giving them a chance to combine DOGE with BTC through the BTCB/DOGEB Vault. The yield-focused product is designed for DeFi users seeking yield with minimal risk. It allows users to deposit BTCB or DOGEB on BNB Chain ( BNB ) and earn a 5% APY, backed by real gas fees and sequencer rewards. Next is the permissionless PoS staking of BTC, BTCB and DOGEB. Born from the network’s collaboration with liquid staking Artemis Finance, the product allows users to stake the only decentralized sequencer network in the BTC ecosystem and earn up to 10% APY, driven by sequencer rewards, BTC gas fees , and MEV. Users have the ability to unstake at anytime. Lastly is the Avalon Finance-powered BTC Lending product, which enables users to deposit BTC or LSTs to earn yield or borrow against them with relatively flexible terms. Earlier this month, GOAT Network proposed a whitepaper for its latest update, which would incorporate the BitVM2 protocol into its Bitcoin Layer 2 model. The update would introduce a multi-round randomized challenge mechanism and a sequencer set commitment scheme to address the problems in BitVM2, as well as zkMIPS to accelerate proof generation and a universal operator. Launched in July 2024 by ZKM, the GOAT Network mainnet is a Layer 2 blockchain network designed to accelerate the parent Bitcoin chain. It is described as “the first Bitcoin-native ZK Rollup” designed to generate native BTC yield.

2025-05-29T10:18:41.000Z,"Russia allows banks to offer crypto products to accredited investors","The Bank of Russia has permitted financial institutions to offer certain cryptocurrency-based financial instruments to accredited investors. Russian banks are now free to provide qualified investors with a range of crypto products, including crypto derivatives, securities and other digital financial assets tied to crypto prices, the central bank announced on May 28. A key stipulation, however, is that these products must not involve the “actual delivery of cryptocurrencies,” the Bank of Russia emphasized. The announcement came alongside the Bank of Russia reporting a 51% increase in crypto asset inflows by Russian residents in the first quarter of 2025, totaling 7.3 trillion rubles ($81.5 billion). T-Bank among the first to offer Bitcoin investment products Some major Russian banks started rolling out cryptocurrency investment products immediately following the Bank of Russia’s announcement. T-Bank (formerly Tinkoff Bank), one of the largest commercial banks in Russia, announced on May 29 the offering of digital financial assets (DFA) tied to Bitcoin ( BTC ). An excerpt from T-Bank’s announcement (translated by Google). Source: T-Bank “The tool allows you to invest in cryptocurrency in rubles through a familiar application — safely and within the legal framework of the Russian Federation, without opening an account on a crypto exchange and difficulties with protecting your wallet,” the bank said. T-Bank’s new “smart asset” offering is issued through the Russian state-backed tokenization platform Atomyze and is available exclusively to accredited investors. Direct crypto investments still not encouraged While greenlighting local lenders to offer crypto products, the Russian central bank still maintains a restrictive approach regarding direct cryptocurrency investment. “The Bank of Russia still does not recommend financial institutions and their clients to invest directly in cryptocurrencies,” the Bank of Russia said in a statement. Related: Russia arrests Blum co-founder Vladimir Smerkis on fraud charges The central bank also noted the ongoing government discussions on the potential launch of an experimental regime that would allow certain investors to trade crypto assets like Bitcoin directly. Russia’s estimated CEX holdings are at $9.2 billion In its latest financial stability review, the Bank of Russia estimated Russians’ crypto holdings on centralized exchanges (CEXs) at 827 billion rubles ($9.2 billion). According to the authority, Bitcoin is leading Russians’ CEX holdings with a 62% share, with Ether ( ETH ) following at 22%. Stablecoins like Tether USDt ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) ranked third with a share of 15.9%. Some local crypto enthusiasts observed that the actual figure of cryptocurrency held by Russians is significantly bigger than the estimated CEX holdings reported by the Bank of Russia. “I know that [Pavel] Durov and [Alexey] Bilyuchenko alone have more money in their wallets than this amount,” Sergey Mendeleev , founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved, wrote on his Telegram channel. He hinted that Russians hold much bigger crypto amounts in wallets and decentralized exchanges.

2025-05-29T10:10:17.000Z,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index Hits 74: What This Greed Signal Means","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index Hits 74: What This Greed Signal Means Ever wonder how the collective mood of the crypto market feels? Are investors trembling in fear or buzzing with excitement? That’s where the Crypto Fear and Greed Index comes in. This fascinating tool offers a snapshot of the prevailing emotional state, and as of May 29, it’s painting a clear picture: the market is feeling pretty confident, sitting comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone at a score of 74. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index? Provided by software development platform Alternative, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a sentiment gauge for the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score closer to 0 signals ‘Extreme Fear’, suggesting investors are likely panic selling. Conversely, a score near 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’, often seen when the market is experiencing euphoria and potentially overheating. Think of it like a market’s emotional temperature check. When the index is low, fear dominates, which can present potential buying opportunities for brave investors following the adage ‘be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful’. When the index is high, greed is rampant, potentially signaling a time for caution or taking profits. How Does the Index Measure Crypto Market Sentiment? The index isn’t based on a single factor but aggregates data from six key sources to get a holistic view of the crypto market sentiment . Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average corresponding values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum (strength of trends) to the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume and strong bullish momentum usually point towards greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts and hashtags on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for keywords related to cryptocurrency. A high volume of positive or overly optimistic posts can signal greed. Surveys (15%): Polls are conducted weekly (though currently paused) to gather investor sentiment directly. This provides a direct, albeit potentially biased, view. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin dominance , which is Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. An increase in Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear (as investors might retreat to the perceived ‘safer’ asset) or strength in Bitcoin leading the market. The index uses it as a gauge of market stability and confidence. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ might signal fear, while terms like ‘buy Bitcoin’ or ‘crypto bull run’ could indicate greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index attempts to provide a balanced perspective on the market’s emotional state, moving beyond just price action. Understanding Cryptocurrency Volatility and Greed The relationship between cryptocurrency volatility and the Fear & Greed Index is crucial. While high volatility *can* indicate fear (especially sharp drops), sustained upward momentum coupled with high volume often pushes the index towards greed. The current score of 74 suggests that despite the inherent volatility in the crypto space, the dominant sentiment is one of confidence and positive expectation among investors. It’s important to remember that crypto markets are notoriously volatile. A high greed score doesn’t eliminate the risk of sudden price swings. In fact, periods of extreme greed can sometimes precede market corrections as the market becomes overextended. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Sentiment Signals As mentioned, Bitcoin dominance plays a role in the index. Historically, when Bitcoin dominance rises significantly, it can sometimes mean investors are moving out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, which can be a sign of caution or fear during downturns. However, during strong bull runs, Bitcoin often leads the charge, and rising dominance might simply reflect its strength pulling the market up, contributing to a ‘greed’ score. The way the index weights Bitcoin dominance at 10% shows it’s a contributing factor but not the primary driver of the overall sentiment score, which is more heavily influenced by price momentum and volume. The Role of Crypto Social Media in Shaping Sentiment Never underestimate the power of online chatter in the crypto world. The crypto social media component of the index captures the buzz, hype, and sometimes, the panic spreading across platforms like Twitter. When everyone is talking about the next moon shot, posting rocket emojis, and confidently predicting parabolic moves, it’s a strong signal of rampant greed. Conversely, widespread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) is a clear indicator of fear. While social media can be a powerful indicator of crowd sentiment, it’s also easily manipulated and prone to echo chambers. The index attempts to filter this, but it’s a reminder that high social media sentiment contributing to greed should be viewed with a critical eye. Using the Index: Actionable Insights So, the index is at 74, firmly in ‘Greed’. What does this mean for you? It’s a Warning, Not a Directive: A high greed score suggests the market might be getting ahead of itself. It’s a time to be cautious, not necessarily to panic sell everything, but perhaps to reconsider aggressive buying or think about taking some profits if you have them. Consider the Contrarian View: The famous quote attributed to Warren Buffett (though sometimes debated in origin) about being fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful is highly relevant. A high greed score is when ‘others are greedy’. Combine with Other Analysis: The index is a sentiment tool. It doesn’t tell you about project fundamentals, technical analysis patterns, or macroeconomic factors. Use it as one piece of the puzzle alongside other research. Understand its Limitations: The index is based on historical correlations and current data. It cannot predict the future with certainty. Market dynamics can change rapidly. Think of the index as a useful indicator of the market’s emotional state, which can influence short-term price movements, but not a crystal ball for long-term investment decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Greed Zone The rise of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 74 confirms what many have felt recently: confidence and positive sentiment are currently driving the market. This move further into the ‘Greed’ zone, influenced by factors like market momentum, volume, and positive crypto social media buzz, along with considerations of Bitcoin dominance and cryptocurrency volatility , signals a period where investors are feeling optimistic. While this can be exciting, especially for those holding assets, it’s also a time that historically warrants caution. Markets driven by strong greed can be susceptible to sharp pullbacks. Using the index as a gauge of collective emotion, combined with thorough personal research and a solid investment strategy, is key to navigating these potentially euphoric, yet risky, market conditions.

2025-05-29T10:09:28.000Z,"Crypto expert predicts Bitcoin to hit $147,000 in 2025","A leading crypto analyst believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be headed for $147,000 this year, if one key condition is met. Pseudonymous chartist TradingShot , known for deep technical analysis of Bitcoin’s macro cycles, published a compelling case on May 29 via X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that the top cryptocurrency is poised for another major breakout. According to their analysis, Bitcoin has once again pierced a critical long-term resistance zone within its upward trending “Channel Up” structure, but has yet to confirm it with a weekly close above that level. Historically, such a close has been the ignition point for explosive price movements. “The last two times Bitcoin closed a weekly candle above the channel’s resistance, it rallied 96.75% or more,” TradingShot noted. The current setup resembles those previous rallies closely, both in structure and magnitude. $147,000 Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingShot So far in May, Bitcoin has broken above its prior January 2025 resistance, setting a fresh all-time high in the process. But as of now, the weekly candle has yet to close decisively above the resistance line. That technical milestone is key: “If we get that weekly close,” TradingShot wrote, “we can expect a minimum 96.75% move from the bottom,” which would place the next target around $147,000. Bitcoin price performance This projected move echoes the earlier runs captured in 2023 and late 2024, where Bitcoin surged between 98% and 107% after similar technical confirmations. The trendline in question is part of a larger long-term ascending channel that Bitcoin has respected since its post-FTX recovery, with each bullish leg following a similar pattern of resistance testing, confirmation, and vertical extension. Bitcoin is currently trading at approximately $108,470, consolidating just beneath that resistance threshold. Whether or not this weekly candle closes above could define the next leg of the bull market, or signal a temporary rejection and deeper consolidation. 1-day Bitcoin price chart.

2025-05-29T10:08:44.000Z,"Arkham claims to have found 87% of Strategy’s Bitcoin","Blockchain analysis company Arham Intelligence claims to have uncovered previously undisclosed wallet addresses tied to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), potentially exposing billions in Bitcoin holdings. In a post referencing Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor’s commitment to privacy, Arkham claimed that it had identified an additional 70,816 BTC linked to the company. At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion. Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did,” Arkham wrote, adding that the amount represents 87.5% of the total Bitcoin holdings of Strategy. Cointelegraph reached out to Arkham and Strategy for comment but had not received a response by publication time. Source: Arkham Intelligence Strategy chairman says publishing addresses “not a good idea” Arkam’s claims follow comments from Saylor about the risks of publishing wallet addresses. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Saylor said that publishing wallet addresses is dangerous for companies holding Bitcoin. “No institutional grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth,” Saylor said . The executive said making wallets public allows every future transaction to be scrutinized, exposing a company to risks that may not be immediately apparent. To highlight his point, Saylor suggested using artificial intelligence to explore the issue. Saylor said if a user puts AI in deep think mode and asks about security problems associated with publishing wallet addresses, the executive said the response could get “50 pages” of security problems.

2025-05-29T10:01:08.000Z,"Norwegian Brokerage Firm K33 Commits $6.2M to Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","Norwegian crypto firm K33 has announced plans to purchase and hold Bitcoin using newly raised funds, joining the growing list of public companies investing in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. On May 28, the brokerage revealed it had secured 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) through a combination of convertible loans and a fresh issue of shares and warrants, with the sole intent of acquiring Bitcoin. CEO Bull Jenssen shared the firm’s bold vision on social media, stating that Bitcoin is likely to be the “best-performing asset in the coming decade.” He added that K33 aims to accumulate as much BTC as possible while building operational synergies with its core brokerage business. “Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build your own?” Jenssen said on X, underlining the firm’s proactive approach. K33 Financing Structure and Future Potential Out of the total 60 million SEK raised, 45 million SEK ($4.6 million) came from interest-free convertible loans maturing in June 2028, while the remaining 15 million SEK ($1.5 million) was raised through the issuance of new shares and warrants. These warrants, which do not carry interest, allow investors to convert them into equity at a fixed price. If fully exercised by March 2026, investors will also be eligible for bonus warrants, potentially raising K33’s total BTC allocation to 75 million SEK ($7.7 million). Based on current Bitcoin prices hovering around $108,000, the firm could acquire approximately 57 BTC. K33 sees this move not just as a store-of-value strategy but as a gateway to expanding its product offerings. In its Q1 interim report, the firm revealed plans to leverage the Bitcoin treasury to explore services like BTC-backed loans, partnerships, and new financial products. BTC Holdings as a Strategic Enabler K33 emphasized that holding Bitcoin goes beyond speculation — it’s central to the company’s broader growth strategy. “With a sizable BTC reserve, we will be able to strengthen our financial position while unlocking new revenue streams,” Jenssen said in the report. While K33’s stock closed 1.96% lower on the day of the announcement, other companies have seen mixed reactions. GameStop gained nearly 12% in March after revealing its Bitcoin plans, only to fall 11% after confirming its first BTC purchase. Blockchain Group, on the other hand, saw its stock surge 225% in November following a similar move.

2025-05-29T10:00:32.000Z,"US Department Of Labor Rescinds 2022 Guidance Against Crypto Investments For Retirement Plans","The US Department of Labor (DOL) has rescinded its 2022 guidance, which discouraged fiduciaries from including cryptocurrency investments in 401(k) retirement plans, citing an “overreach” by the previous administration. DOL Rescinds Biden Admin’s Crypto Guidance On Wednesday, the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) rescinded its 2022 compliance release. The guidance was issued in March 2022 following former US President Joe Biden’s executive order that required the government to assess the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. It directed plan fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to exercise “extreme care” before adding digital assets to their investment menus, asserting that the digital asset industry’s early stage could pose significant risks. At this early stage in the history of cryptocurrencies, the Department has serious concerns about the prudence of a fiduciary’s decision to expose a 401(k) plan’s participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies, or other products whose value is tied to cryptocurrencies. These investments present significant risks and challenges to participants’ retirement accounts, including significant risks of fraud, theft, and loss. The EBSA release noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff had cautioned that digital asset investments were “highly speculative.” It also cited custodial, recordkeeping, and valuation concerns as part of the reasons for the warning. Moreover, it alleged that the evolving regulatory environment made digital asset investments for retirement plans difficult for fiduciaries to comply with the law. “Rules and regulations governing the cryptocurrency markets may be evolving, and some market participants may be operating outside of existing regulatory frameworks or not complying with them,” the guidance stated. In 2023, Reuters reported that a US federal judge dismissed an investment adviser company’s case against the DOL. ForUsAll sued the agency over the 2022 compliance release, alleging that the guidance was “unlawful,” illegally skipped the rulemaking process, and pushed customers away from crypto offerings. However, the judge considered that, even if it was rescinded, it would not have changed the DOJ’s view about cryptocurrencies. A Neutral Approach To Digital Assets According to the DOL’s May 28 release, the language used in the 2022 guidance “deviated from the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and marked a departure from the department’s historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.” The DOJ highlighted that it had a neutral approach to specific investment types and strategies before the 2022 compliance release. As such, it is restoring its historical approach by neither endorsing nor disapproving of plan fiduciaries that concluded digital asset investments are appropriate for the plan’s menu. “By rescinding the 2022 guidance, the department reaffirms its neutral stance, neither endorsing, nor disapproving of, plan fiduciaries who conclude that the inclusion of cryptocurrency in a plan’s investment menu is appropriate,” the statement reads. Moreover, US Secretary of Labor, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, criticized the previous administration for overstepping with the 2022 guidance, affirming that “The Biden administration’s Department of Labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale.” “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not DC bureaucrats,” Chavez-DeRemer concluded, seemingly supporting the Trump administration’s efforts to halt the previous “regulation by enforcement” approach and turn the US into “the crypto capital of the world.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/us-department-of-labor-rescinds-2022-guidance-against-crypto-investments-for-retirement-plans/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|401(K) Retirement Plan|Biden administration|bitcoin|Bitcoin Retirement Plan|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto guidance|Crypto Market|crypto regulation|Department of Labor (DOL)|DOL|Trump administration|US SEC",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T10:00:14.000Z,"US Tariffs: Crucial Appeal Challenges Executive Power Ruling","BitcoinWorld US Tariffs: Crucial Appeal Challenges Executive Power Ruling While the world of cryptocurrency often feels distinct from traditional politics and trade disputes, major legal battles over US Tariffs and government authority can send significant ripples through global markets, influencing everything from investor sentiment to supply chain stability. This is precisely why a recent development regarding the Trump administration’s appeal of a court ruling blocking certain tariffs warrants our attention. Understanding the Core Dispute: What Are These US Tariffs? At the heart of this legal skirmish are tariffs that the Trump administration imposed on April 2nd. These duties were reportedly dubbed ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs, though the specific goods targeted aren’t detailed in the initial report. Tariffs, in essence, are taxes placed on imported goods. Governments use them for various reasons: To protect domestic industries from foreign competition. To generate revenue. To exert political or economic pressure on other countries. However, imposing tariffs isn’t always a straightforward executive decision. In the United States, the President’s power to impose tariffs is often derived from specific legislation passed by Congress. The Legal Challenge: Why Did the Court Block the Tariffs? A federal court issued a ruling that dealt a blow to the administration’s move, specifically blocking these ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs. The court’s reasoning centered on the scope of Executive Power , finding that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority under a key piece of legislation: the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) . Let’s break down what IEEPA is and why it’s relevant: What is IEEPA? The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, passed in 1977, grants the President the authority to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. It’s a powerful tool designed for genuine crisis situations. The Court’s Finding: The court determined that the imposition of these specific tariffs did not fall within the legitimate scope of IEEPA as applied in this instance. This could mean several things: The situation prompting the tariffs wasn’t deemed a true ‘national emergency’ as defined by IEEPA’s use. The specific actions (the tariffs) weren’t directly related to addressing the declared emergency in a way the law permits. The President’s use of IEEPA bypassed other legal frameworks or congressional authority that should have been used for this type of trade action. Essentially, the court ruled that the administration’s action overstepped the legal boundaries set by Congress, challenging the extent of the President’s Government Authority in matters of Trade Policy when invoking emergency powers. The Appeal: Why is the Trump Administration Fighting Back? Reuters reported that the Trump administration quickly filed an appeal against this federal court ruling. This isn’t just about reversing the blocking of these particular tariffs; it’s a defense of the administration’s interpretation of presidential powers, particularly under IEEPA. The appeal signals several key objectives for the administration: Defending Executive Prerogative: The administration is likely arguing that the President’s authority under IEEPA is broad and that the court misinterpreted the scope of these emergency powers. Upholding the court’s ruling could set a precedent that limits future presidential actions on trade or other economic matters during perceived emergencies. Maintaining Trade Strategy Leverage: Tariffs are a key tool in the administration’s Trade Policy strategy. Losing the ability to impose them via IEEPA weakens their position in trade negotiations and disputes. Avoiding Congressional Constraints: Using IEEPA allows the executive branch to act unilaterally, bypassing the often lengthy and complex process of getting trade legislation through Congress. The appeal aims to preserve this more direct path to implementing trade measures. This appeal elevates the dispute from a specific tariff action to a significant constitutional question regarding the separation of powers and the limits of presidential authority, especially when invoking emergency statutes like the Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) . What Are the Potential Outcomes of This Crucial Appeal? The legal battle is now heading to a higher court, likely an appeals court, and potentially the Supreme Court. The possible outcomes include: Outcome Description Potential Implication for Trade Policy Court Upholds Ruling The appeals court agrees with the lower court that the President exceeded IEEPA authority. Significantly limits the President’s ability to use IEEPA for broad tariff actions, potentially requiring more congressional involvement in Trade Policy . Court Overturns Ruling The appeals court disagrees with the lower court, finding the President’s use of IEEPA was lawful. Affirms a broad interpretation of presidential emergency powers under IEEPA, giving the executive branch significant unilateral power in economic matters. Case is Remanded The appeals court sends the case back to the lower court for reconsideration based on specific instructions or clarification. Delays a final decision and requires further legal proceedings, prolonging uncertainty regarding the specific tariffs and the scope of Executive Power . Each outcome carries weight, not just for these specific tariffs, but for future presidential actions under emergency powers and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches regarding Trade Policy and economic measures. Why Should a Crypto Enthusiast Care About Tariffs and Executive Power? While tariffs on goods might seem distant from Bitcoin or decentralized finance, this legal battle touches upon themes highly relevant to the cryptocurrency space: Macroeconomic Stability: Trade disputes and legal uncertainty surrounding Trade Policy can increase market volatility. Tariffs can disrupt supply chains, increase costs for businesses and consumers (potentially leading to inflation), and strain international relations. Such instability affects all markets, including crypto, which is often sensitive to global risk sentiment. Regulatory Risk and Government Overreach: The core of the court’s ruling is about limiting Government Authority and preventing potential executive overreach by adhering to legal statutes like the Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) . The crypto community is acutely aware of regulatory risk and the potential for governments to impose restrictions. This case is a high-profile example of the checks and balances within the US system pushing back against executive actions deemed beyond statutory limits. It highlights the ongoing tension between state power and economic freedom, a theme resonating with crypto’s decentralized ethos. Legal Precedent: The final ruling in this appeal will set a precedent for how emergency powers can be used in the future. A broad interpretation could empower future administrations to take swift, unilateral economic actions, which could theoretically extend to regulating digital assets under certain emergency declarations. A narrow interpretation could provide more clarity and potentially require more transparent, legislated approaches to economic controls. Global Economic Interconnectedness: Tariffs and trade wars underscore the interconnectedness of the global economy. Crypto markets operate globally, and disruptions in one major economic bloc can have ripple effects everywhere. Understanding these traditional economic pressures helps in navigating the broader financial landscape. Therefore, tracking this legal battle isn’t just about niche US Tariffs ; it’s about monitoring shifts in global economic stability, the balance of Government Authority , and the potential for regulatory actions stemming from executive power – all factors that can influence the environment in which cryptocurrency operates. Challenges and Actionable Insights Challenges: Prolonged Uncertainty: The appeal process takes time, leaving businesses and markets uncertain about the future of these specific tariffs and the broader implications for Trade Policy and the use of IEEPA. Economic Impact: Regardless of the legal outcome, the dispute itself can create friction in international trade relationships and add to global economic headwinds. Setting Precedent: The outcome could significantly alter the landscape of presidential power in economic matters, which has long-term implications. Actionable Insights for the Informed Reader: Stay Informed on Macro News: Don’t silo yourself to just crypto news. Major legal and economic developments like this appeal on US Tariffs and Executive Power are critical components of the broader financial ecosystem. Understand Regulatory Frameworks: While crypto aims for decentralization, it operates within a world governed by laws. Pay attention to how traditional regulatory powers (like those under IEEPA) are interpreted and applied, as this can offer clues about potential future approaches to digital assets. Assess Risk: Understand that macro-level events contribute to market risk. Legal challenges to Government Authority and shifts in Trade Policy can increase volatility. Consider how such factors fit into your overall investment strategy. Conclusion: A Battle for Authority with Wide-Reaching Implications The Trump administration’s appeal against the ruling blocking the ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs is far more than a simple procedural step; it’s a crucial legal battle defending the scope of presidential Executive Power , particularly under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) . The federal court’s initial finding that the President exceeded his Government Authority highlights the vital role of judicial review in checking executive actions, especially concerning significant matters like US Tariffs and Trade Policy . As this appeal moves through the courts, its outcome will not only determine the fate of specific tariffs but will also set a potentially defining precedent for the balance of power in Washington and the legal limits of presidential action during times of perceived economic emergency. For anyone navigating the complex world of finance, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market, understanding these fundamental legal and economic disputes is essential, as they shape the very foundations upon which global markets operate.

Despite that, Pakistan has announced plans to establish a government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, signaling a major shift from its previous anti-crypto stance. Bilal bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council , revealed the initiative at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas , praising the United States for inspiring the move. He emphasized that the Bitcoins will be held indefinitely and not sold, marking a long-term commitment rather than a speculative play. This will be the ultimate chance for Pakistan to become the first South Asian country to take such a bold step into the future of decentralized finance. As of April 2025, the US governments collectively hold 463,741 BTC, representing around 2.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Today, rewrites history.

However, the global wave of crypto adoption , especially moves by the US, has influenced Pakistan to soften its stance in 2025. The country is now actively building its crypto infrastructure, led by the Pakistan Crypto Council, which aims to boost blockchain innovation, stablecoins, and decentralized finance in the country. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Russia Allows Crypto-Related Products for Investors – But With These Limits , Strategic Partnerships and Supportive Policies Earlier this year, Pakistan signed a Letter of Intent with US-based World Liberty Financial , a firm connected to President Donald Trump’s family.

2025-05-29T09:55:39.000Z,"$750K in One Day—Bitcoin Pepe 72 Hours from Tier 1 Launch Frenzy","The post $750K in One Day—Bitcoin Pepe 72 Hours from Tier 1 Launch Frenzy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Meme season is back—and it’s not on Ethereum or Solana. It’s about to happen for the first time ever on Bitcoin thanks to Bitcoin Pepe , and investors need to strap in. Trillions of dollars are about to flow into meme coins, and nobody, not even the most hardcore degen traders, are ready for what could happen if BPEP hits terminal velocity. BPEP is the world’s first meme-centric layer 2 built on BTC, and it has just raised a staggering $750,000 in a single day as the countdown to its May 31st launch begins. Rumors of a Tier 1 CEX listing are swirling, and the end of this month may mark the start of a historical capital rotation. Smart money knows, and it is not buying BTC, which has already pumped, but BPEP—knowing that it is the perfect leveraged asset to front-run the massive capital rotation into Bitcoin-based meme coins. With $12m raised already, the fireworks are about to go off. How Bitcoin Pepe caught the perfect narrative Bitcoin Pepe is a visionary Layer 2 built on top of Bitcoin, combining the meme coin energy with the best-in-class security and liquidity from BTC. Bitcoin looks ready to shoot to $155K, and BPEP will be following it closely, making it the perfect trade for anyone bullish on BTC’s next evolution. Bitcoin has never had speculative trading and has become crypto’s boomer asset. That was until Bitcoin Pepe decided to build ‘Solana on Bitcoin.’ The driving force behind BPEP is its brand-new PEP-20 token standard, and now this crypto presale is about to unleash Ethereum’s ERC-20 moment on Bitcoin, but with 10 times more liquidity. BPEP is actively redefining Bitcoin’s role in crypto from digital gold to ground zero for meme coin trading and DeFi activity. This layer 2 provides lightning-fast transactions, negligible fees, and the seamless trading experience that retail loves. It has an enormous first-mover advantage, perfectly timed with BTC’s explosive price action—the perfect conditions for a massive 100X rally. Bitcoin Pepe: What happens when a layer 2 unlocks $2 trillion in dormant capital? Bitcoin Pepe’s native bridge could attract trillions of dormant BTC capital to fuel a meme coin rally far larger than anything seen last year on Solana. And all of this economic activity is feeding back to BPEP, the native token. The PEP-20 token standard could go down as one of crypto’s most important unlocks, doing for Bitcoin what ERC-20 did for Ethereum. But BPEP hasn’t gone mainstream yet, and that’s why it provides such a fantastic and intriguing trade opportunity. BPEP is a perfect pick-and-shovel play for the future of BTC, and almost all investors are still debating where to dig. The current price of $0.0377 won’t last long, and in crypto, the spoils go to those who move fastest. Raising $750K in 24 hours as Tier 1 CEX listing rapidly approaches Bitcoin Pepe is about to eat the entire meme coin economy and smashed a massive $750K in just 24 hours. This is the signal for anyone paying attention that a high-velocity capital rotation into the Bitcoin meme ecosystem is about to take place. Having a Tier 1 listing already inked before launch shows that the industry’s big players are similarly bullish on BPEP, and on listing day alone, BPEP could pump as much as 87% . Most presales struggle to gain traction, yet BPEP has already raised an impressive $12m and secured a listing. Investors have 72 hours left until BPEP lists, and once live on a Tier 1 CEX, retail will start panic buying. The pre-launch price of $0.0377 will disappear forever. Bitcoin Pepe is about to run the SOL 2021 playbook again, but this time with way more liquidity, and the window to front-run this opportunity is disappearing fast.

2025-05-29T09:50:34.000Z,"Bitcoin: Bold Trump Sons Predict $170K+ Price by 2026","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Bold Trump Sons Predict $170K+ Price by 2026 Get ready, crypto enthusiasts! A significant forecast has emerged from a rather unexpected corner of the political landscape. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, sons of former U.S. President Donald Trump, have stepped into the Bitcoin prediction arena, offering a remarkably bullish outlook for the coming years. Their comments, made at a major industry event, are certainly turning heads and adding another layer to the ongoing conversation about Bitcoin’s future. What is the Trump Bitcoin Prediction? During the Bitcoin 2025 conference held in Las Vegas, both Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump shared their thoughts on the potential trajectory of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. According to reports from The Block, Eric Trump stated his belief that Bitcoin has the potential to exceed the $170,000 mark by the end of 2026. Donald Trump Jr. reportedly echoed this optimistic sentiment, aligning with the ambitious target set by his brother. This Trump Bitcoin prediction is noteworthy not just for the price target itself, but for the source. Coming from individuals associated with a prominent political family, it signals a growing awareness and perhaps even acceptance of Bitcoin within mainstream circles, albeit from a personal investment perspective rather than official policy. The Michael Saylor Connection and Trump Family Crypto An interesting detail shared by Eric Trump sheds light on the family’s foray into the digital asset space. Eric credited Michael Saylor, the co-founder of MicroStrategy (now known as Strategy), as a key figure who helped guide the Trump family’s move into crypto. Saylor, a well-known Bitcoin maximalist and proponent of corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies, appears to have played an influential role in introducing the Trumps to the world of digital assets. Eric mentioned that Saylor inspired their recent “treasury experiments.” While the exact nature and scale of these experiments in Trump family crypto holdings weren’t detailed, this suggests that the family has not only been learning about crypto but actively engaging with it, potentially exploring ways to incorporate it into their financial holdings or business operations. This connection highlights the impact that influential figures like Saylor can have on bringing new participants, even those from traditional finance or political backgrounds, into the crypto ecosystem. Why $170,000 by 2026? Factors Influencing the Bitcoin Price 2026 Outlook Predicting the future price of any asset, especially one as volatile as Bitcoin, is inherently challenging. While the Trump sons didn’t provide a detailed breakdown of their methodology for arriving at the $170,000+ target for Bitcoin price 2026 , we can look at general factors often cited by analysts and proponents that could drive such growth: Increasing Institutional Adoption: More corporations, asset managers, and traditional financial institutions are allocating capital to Bitcoin, viewing it as a store of value or a hedge against inflation. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. is a prime example of infrastructure being built for easier institutional access. Growing Retail Interest: As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream and accessible, more individual investors are likely to enter the market, increasing demand. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin undergoes a ‘halving’ event approximately every four years, which cuts the rate at which new Bitcoin is created by half. This supply shock has historically preceded significant price rallies. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainty, inflation fears, and changes in monetary policy by central banks can drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin. Technological Development: Ongoing improvements to the Bitcoin network and surrounding infrastructure (like the Lightning Network) can enhance its utility and scalability. It’s important to remember that price predictions, including this one from Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are speculative and subject to many variables. Market sentiment, regulatory changes, and unforeseen global events can all significantly impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Putting the Prediction in Perspective: Is $170K Realistic? A $170,000+ price tag by late 2026 would represent a substantial increase from current levels (assuming the article is written sometime after early 2024). While ambitious, it’s not the highest prediction circulating in the crypto space, but it is certainly on the more bullish side. Many analysts and models suggest six-figure targets are possible in the coming years, particularly post-halving. Consider these points when evaluating the forecast: Prediction Source Target Price (Example) Target Year (Example) Trump Sons (Eric & Donald Jr.) $170,000+ 2026 Various Analysts/Models (Range) $100,000 – $500,000+ 2024 – 2030 Michael Saylor (Strategy) Long-term bullish (Specific near-term targets vary) Ongoing accumulation This particular prediction gains traction due to the individuals making it and the context of the Bitcoin 2025 conference. It serves as a talking point and reflects a certain level of conviction among some prominent figures entering the space. Challenges and Considerations for Bitcoin’s Growth While the optimism around a $170,000+ Bitcoin price 2026 is compelling, several challenges could impact its path: Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable regulations could stifle adoption and innovation. Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its dramatic price swings. Sharp downturns can test investor confidence. Security Risks: Hacking, scams, and loss of private keys remain risks for individual holders. Competition: While Bitcoin is dominant, other cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies are evolving. Public Perception: Despite increasing adoption, skepticism and negative narratives persist. These factors highlight the speculative nature of investing in Bitcoin and the importance of a long-term perspective. Actionable Insights for Readers What should you take away from this Trump Bitcoin prediction ? It’s a Prediction, Not a Guarantee: Treat this forecast, like all price predictions, as an opinion based on current information and future assumptions. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions based on predictions, thoroughly research Bitcoin, its underlying technology, market trends, and potential risks. Understand the Context: The prediction comes from individuals who are relatively new to the space compared to seasoned crypto veterans, though they have been influenced by a major figure like Michael Saylor. Consider the Source: The Trump family’s increasing openness to crypto is a notable development, reflecting a broader trend of mainstream interest. Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources and analysts to get a balanced view of market sentiment and fundamental developments. The mention of Trump family crypto involvement, guided by Michael Saylor, adds a layer of intrigue and suggests that high-profile individuals and families are actively exploring digital assets beyond just casual interest. Conclusion: A Bullish Sign from a Surprising Source The prediction from Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump that Bitcoin could surpass $170,000 by the end of 2026 is a significant and bullish statement. While ambitious, it reflects a growing optimism within certain circles regarding Bitcoin’s future value. The acknowledgment of Michael Saylor’s influence underscores the role key figures play in educating and onboarding new participants, even those from prominent political backgrounds, into the world of Trump family crypto and beyond. As the crypto market continues to evolve, such predictions serve as interesting markers of sentiment and potential targets. However, prudent investors will always combine such forecasts with their own thorough research and a clear understanding of the inherent risks involved in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. The journey towards the predicted Bitcoin price 2026 will undoubtedly be dynamic and influenced by a multitude of global factors.

2025-05-29T09:50:22.000Z,"Trader Charts XRP Path towards 109,000% Rocket Rally. Here’s the Timeline","Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent analyst on X, recently shared a chart outlining an ambitious trajectory for XRP, suggesting a potential path to $2,500 per token by 2030. While the chart itself does not specify catalysts, several major developments have fueled renewed optimism among XRP supporters and may provide the foundation for such bold projections. #XRP ROAD TO $2,500 pic.twitter.com/0K4M3o6N10 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 27, 2025 CME Group’s XRP Futures Launch One of the most significant recent milestones for XRP is the recent launch of XRP futures by CME Group, a leading derivatives marketplace. This long-anticipated move introduced both micro (2,500 XRP) and standard (50,000 XRP) cash-settled contracts, benchmarked against the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate. CME’s inclusion of XRP in its crypto derivatives suite, which already features Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, reflects the growing institutional and retail interest in the asset and its underlying technology, the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The introduction of regulated futures is widely seen as a precursor to spot ETF approval , which could further legitimize XRP in the eyes of institutional investors and drive additional liquidity to the market. Ripple Lawsuit Nears Resolution Progress in the long-running legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also contributed to positive sentiment. In April 2025, both parties filed a joint motion to pause their appeals , a move granted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The community is anticipating the end of the lawsuit. Despite some recent procedural challenges , both parties work together to gain approval of their settlement agreement and put an end to the legal dispute. Dubai’s Tokenized Real Estate Initiative on XRPL Another major development is Dubai’s selection of the XRPL to power a new real estate tokenization initiative. The Dubai Land Department, in partnership with Prypco and Ctrl Alt, aims to take over the $16 billion market through tokenization. This project will enable fractional property ownership, making real estate investment accessible to a broader audience and increasing the utility and adoption of XRPL-backed solutions. This integration of blockchain-based records is expected to set a new standard for transparency and efficiency in property transactions, introducing XRP to an untapped market. Is XRP Going to $2,500? XRP is currently trading at $2.26 with a market cap of $136.64 billion. Reaching $2,500 with its current circulating supply of 58.68 billion would place its market cap at over $146 trillion. While this market cap seems unrealistic to many, experts have debunked the market cap myth, suggesting that XRP can reach thousands of dollars without any limitations.

2025-05-29T09:45:58.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Gears Up for next Rally: Price Analysis","The institutions are still buying, and a new sovereign treasury is in the pipeline for Pakistan. With Bitcoin (BTC) continuing to hold above the $106,000 support level, the next rally could be brewing. Increasing buying interest for Bitcoin The US Spot Bitcoin ETFs have just recorded their 10th day of positive inflows as another 3.97K BTC entered the coffers. This was all swallowed up by the Blackrock IBIT ETF with just a couple of small negative outflows from ARKB (315 BTC) and FBTC (128 BTC). These last 10 days brought in a total of more than 36K BTC. As an ever-increasing number of companies announce that they are setting up their own Bitcoin treasuries, a new sovereign country has thrown its hat into the ring. It was announced at Bitcoin Vegas 2025 on Day 3 that Pakistan would establish a national bitcoin wallet as part of a “government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”. The Pakistani representative at the Bitcoin conference said that the country would devote 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to Bitcoin mining, and that digital assets already owned by the government would be kept in the national Bitcoin wallet and held long-term. $BTC price action moves sideways within wedge Source: TradingView The short-term price action for $BTC shows that the $106,000 support is holding up well. More sideways price movement has revealed $BTC to be inside a wedge. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicators climbing, which could enable positive price momentum to lift the price up to the top of the wedge and the resistance formed by the January all-time high. The current rally would get very bullish if the price can get above $110,760 which would make a higher high. Moving averages are sorting themselves into order Source: TradingView The daily chart for $BTC indicates that the price may be about to fall underneath the ascending trendline that stretches back to early April. However, there is still the rest of the day for the bulls to regain this trendline. The three major simple moving averages are displayed, and this reveals that a golden cross has just taken place, as the 50 SMA (blue) crosses above both the 100 (green) and 200 (red) SMAs. In order to start being extremely bullish, the 100 (green) SMA must now also cross above the 200 (red) SMA. When the SMAs were in order last time, the first big run-up to over $100,000 was able to occur. Bull market cycle to end in Q4? Source: TradingView The above chart is the 3-monthly and it reveals that from the 2013 bull market top to the next top in 2017, a total of 16 3-month candles were needed. For the next bull market cycle until the top in 2021, exactly 16 candles were printed again. We enter the current bull market cycle and so far we are in candle 14, which will take us to the end of June. Could this mean that there are another two 3-month candles to be printed before we hit the top of this cycle in Q4 of this year? This could certainly be a possibility. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI for this timeframe is showing that there is still a little way to go before the indicator lines hit the peak (blue line).

2025-05-29T09:39:45.000Z,"Here’s why Moonchain’s MXC rallied over 240% today","MXC, the native token of the Layer 3 blockchain platform Moonchain, surged as much as 247% recently, thanks to the reactivation of its mining program and a wave of ecosystem updates. According to Coingecko data, Moonchain ( MXC ) reached an intraday high of $0.00525 on the morning of May 29, Asian time, pushing its market cap past $11.6 million. When writing, the token was up 675% from its lowest point this year, marking one of its strongest moves in 2025 so far. MXC crypto also recorded a sharp uptick in trading activity, with daily volume spiking over 500% compared to the previous day, reaching nearly $22.5 million, signalling a flood of new interest and momentum. What’s behind the rally? There are three main catalysts driving MXC’s breakout: First, the Moonchain team officially reactivated MXC mining on its network using MatchX’s M2 Pro and NEO miners, following a temporary outage on May 21. This reactivation also came after a community poll conducted by MatchX on X on May 19, where 97.9% of participants voted in favor of resuming MXC mining. For context, MatchX is a German tech company that builds low-energy mining hardware specifically for the Moonchain ecosystem. Their devices help power Moonchain’s data infrastructure and allow users to earn MXC by participating in its Proof of Participation (PoP) system. Second, Moonchain teased the upcoming launch of its Initial Hardware Offering (IHO). This campaign will send out free physical mining devices, possibly wearables like smartwatches or rings, to Moonchain token holders using an Ethereum smart contract. You might also like: SEC delays Grayscale’s Avalanche and Cardano ETF decisions to July According to the project’s Q2 2025 roadmap, the IHO will also include “health-based” mining devices and limited-edition high-hash-rate models to reward users who lock up their tokens early. Distribution hubs are also being set up in key regions to ensure faster deliveries. Third, Moonchain recently completed an integration with OKX Wallet , a leading multi-chain wallet in the Web3 space. The integration allows users to easily access Moonchain’s dApps, staking features, and token tools across mobile, browser, and Telegram. With OKX Wallet ’s support for over 1,000 protocols, the move better positions both existing and new users to engage with the ecosystem. What Is Moonchain? For those unfamiliar, Moonchain is a Layer 3 blockchain platform that combines AI, IoT, and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). Its native token, MXC, powers transactions within the network, supports an inter-chain NFT marketplace, and rewards participants via its energy-efficient Proof of Participation model. The project also features MXProtocol and is building on Ethereum’s Layer 2 tech, including its own zkEVM , to improve compatibility with existing Ethereum-based apps. This positions Moonchain as a solid pick for developers working on real-world use cases, especially in smart devices and data-sharing networks. MXC price outlook On the technical side, MXC has broken out of a multi-month descending channel, which often signals the start of a potential new uptrend. It also held above the key 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0048 before cooling off to around $0.0041 at press time. MXC price, MACD and RSI chart — May 29 | Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators support the bullish case. The MACD lines are crossing upward, and the Relative Strength Index is in the overbought zone, often a sign of sustained buying pressure and strong buyer conviction in an emerging uptrend. However, overbought conditions can also bring short-term selling pressure if traders begin to lock in profits. If MXC continues upward, the next likely target is around $0.0061, a key level it failed to reach in its earlier push. But if it drops below the $0.0030 support, it could slide further down toward the $0.00060 range, which is currently acting as a psychological support zone.

Ethereum jumped past $2,700 earlier today, while TON has notched a notable increase after some developments on the Telegram-xAI front. Bitcoin Back to $108.5K It was this time last week when the primary cryptocurrency continued its recent impressive rally and skyrocketed past its January 2025 all-time high and all the way up to almost $112,000. This became the latest and current peak . However, the asset retraced on Friday when US President Donald Trump recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU. Bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop of around $3,000-4,000. It recovered some ground over the weekend and started another leg up on Monday and Tuesday, which pushed it to nearly $111,000. It couldn’t continue north despite the positive flows into the US ETFs and even slipped to $107,000 yesterday. After testing that support on a couple of occasions, BTC bounced off and now trades at around $108,500.

Ethereum has also charted an impressive jump since yesterday and is above $2,700 now. PEPE has added 6% of value, while PI has dropped by over 3% and is close to breaking below $0.7.

2025-05-29T09:34:47.000Z,"Larsen said Ripple did not fund the Bitcoin \""Change the Code\"" campaign","Chris Larsen, co-founder of Ripple, has clarified that the company was not behind the funding of the controversial “Change the Code” campaign. The initiative, in partnership with Greenpeace, set out to pressure the Bitcoin community into dumping its energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) consensus model. Larsen added that he supported the campaign personally rather than as a corporate action by Ripple. He also cited progress in Bitcoin’s energy profile. He referred to a University of Cambridge study that points out that mining today uses large increments of renewable energy, including nuclear, wind, and hydropower. In addition, more flared gas energy that would otherwise go to waste is being used to power mining operations. Despite that, the campaign continues to fuel criticism. The initiative is deemed anti-Bitcoin by many in the Bitcoin community, with some accusing Ripple of pushing it as a way to plant a seed of doubt within the Bitcoin network and promote XRP instead. In early 2023 when I funded the “Change the Code” campaign, my goal was to see if there was a way to turn Bitcoin into an accelerator for direct air capture. The campaign didn’t work, and that’s ok!

Bitcoin’s energy transition in the… https://t.co/qIcadDtzDu — Chris Larsen (@chrislarsensf) May 28, 2025 Ripple’s symbolic donation sparks controversy The latest donation made by Ripple of the ‘Skull of Satoshi’ to the Bitcoin community has stirred both praise and criticism as well. The artwork, once used as Bitcoin’s energy consumption ultimatum, was officially handed over at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas. Currently, it’s on display in the Bitcoin Museum in Nashville. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called the gesture an olive branch. According to him, Bitcoin serves as a resilient system and advises the crypto industry to adhere to common goals, including innovation, regulatory clarity, and financial inclusion. Garlinghouse said he hoped the donation would be a reminder that the industry’s different communities have more in common than not. Although there have been disagreements in the past, Garlinghouse said that Ripple’s current stand is to collaborate with the industry rather than compete. Top executives at Ripple have also publicly denied the charges that the company lobbied against having a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) in the United States. Ripple has also said that it supports a multi-asset approach to the national crypto reserve structure. Not everyone shared the sentiment. Head of Digital Assets at VanEck Matthew Sigel slammed the move. Sigel dismissed the sculpture and instead demanded a formal apology for Ripple funding Greenpeace’s anti-Bitcoin efforts, asking him on X, “Is that your apology?” Some criticized the popular XRP lawyer John Deaton for attending Bitcoin 2025, referring to him as an “XRP guy.” David Schwartz, Ripple CTO, also argued back at Bitcoin maximalists that XRP is not centralized as the ledger is without an issuer and remains decentralized even with Ripple’s influence. XRP price stagnates despite VivoPower boost Market response to Ripple’s outreach has been lukewarm. Despite the recent developments, XRP traded at $2.29, more than 5% down for the week. Yet, it has done little to move XRP. Over the past week, the token traded at $2.24 to $2.47, appearing to consolidate. The trading volume was up 28% to $2.63 billion. Also, the onchain volume of XRP has surged, up 21.7% over the last day. While CoinGlass’s data also shows derivatives volume surged 20.2% to $3.95 billion, open interest dropped 0.95% to $4.78 billion, indicating a mixed sentiment among leveraged traders. Technical indicators lack near-term momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 46 in neutral territory. The 100- and 200-day SMAs remain above current prices, but the 10 – and 30-day EMAs and SMAs all flash sell signals. A rally above $2.40 could send the exchange rate toward $2.60, but a decline under $2.24 could lead to $2.10.

2025-05-29T09:31:12.000Z,"Silent Payments: The upgrade Bitcoin can’t afford to ignore | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. While Bitcoin ( BTC ) may have started out with the perception of “anonymous internet money,” the reality of Bitcoin being transparent-by-design has finally started to take hold in the space. While Bitcoin offers powerful censorship-resistance and decentralization in theory, a lack of accessible privacy features drastically limits its effectiveness in harsher environments. Political dissidents seeking funding, journalists accepting donations, and whistleblowers raising support have all started to realize that Bitcoin is actually the world’s most efficient and largest financial surveillance system, mapping who paid whom, when, and how much. You might also like: How to build a 1B TPS blockchain without decentralization, security, or shame | Opinion Imagine for a moment that anytime you entered your credit card number online or shared your Venmo info with a friend, that person could simply Google your info and learn when you had received money, how much you get paid, and where you spend your hard-earned money. That nightmare scenario is a reality for most users of Bitcoin today, but thankfully, there are brilliant minds working to make privacy great again on Bitcoin. Silent payments ‘address’ the problem In 2022, a legendary Bitcoin developer and researcher named Ruben Somsen made a startling proposal out of nowhere: what if we could bring the same level of privacy when receiving Bitcoin as people expect, all without any changes to Bitcoin itself? This concept was quickly named ‘Silent Payments’ and is a new address type for Bitcoin that allows you to create a single, static address to share with friends, use for donations, or post for tips without sacrificing privacy. When someone wants to send you a payment, they use the unique public key that is a part of your Silent Payment address, combine it with the public keys of the outputs they want to send, and generate a unique, one-time address that looks on-chain just like any other regular Bitcoin payment. While the concept of a “stealth address” has existed in Bitcoin for many years, all previous attempts had deep flaws that greatly limited the user experience or privacy offered. Silent Payments are stealth addresses, perfected. Silent Payments beautifully addresses the most prevalent privacy issues when receiving Bitcoin, all while actually simplifying the experience and getting Bitcoin much closer to that Venmo-like dream. All any Bitcoin user needs now is one address that never changes, and they can easily receive Bitcoin while preserving their privacy and that of the sender, anytime, any day. Even better, we can now use these Silent Payment addresses to build out powerful username systems like CashApp’s CashTags, all without a trusted middleman or a loss of privacy! Better privacy meets better user experience. Silent Payments are here, but adoption is not Like any new technology, the most pressing issue for Silent Payments is now education and adoption. While wallets like Cake Wallet have led the way in empowering their users to leverage Silent Payments since 2024, wallet adoption has been slow on the uptake. Many wallets and companies have signaled their support for the concept of Silent Payments, but most are waiting on upstream libraries to add native support and simplify the integration process. In the meantime, however, many wallets have already started to support the simplest part of Silent Payments—allowing you to send to a Silent Payments address, but not allowing you to receive to one. This is far easier from an integration standpoint and is rapidly gaining adoption. Once a few other major wallets in the space take the time to enhance their users’ privacy through Silent Payments, a snowball effect of adoption will make this upgrade to Bitcoin’s privacy unstoppable. The sooner we can get away from the broken paradigm of constantly-rotating Bitcoin addresses and shattered privacy expectations, the faster we can grow the number of people experiencing freedom money like never before. The adoption of Silent Payments is inevitable, but you can help speed up the progress of Bitcoin like never before simply by asking your favorite wallet to implement Silent Payment support today! Privacy: Choose it or lose it Unlike many promising privacy improvements to Bitcoin, Silent Payments requires no code changes to the Bitcoin project, has no impact on fees, and doesn’t need any costly rough consensus. It’s time that we choose to reclaim our privacy each time we use Bitcoin, transaction by transaction, through the power of Silent Payments. We cannot normalize our finances being transparent to the world if we want to continue to preserve human freedom. This oversharing needs to end and can end…silently.

2025-05-29T09:30:13.000Z,"Dogecoin Is About To Enter It’s Worst Month In History – Why June Could Be Bloody","With the month of May drawing to a quick close, it looks like the Dogecoin price is about to end its second month in a row in the green. This has come as a welcome surprise in a month where expectations were that the market would continue to go down. However, this means that Dogecoin is about to enter what has historically been the worst month since its inception, with more red closes than green. Why The Dogecoin Price Could Go Down In June The month of June has been known to be very bad for the Dogecoin price, and this has been the case for most of the last 11 years. In more than a decade, the Dogecoin price has only closed out the month of June in the green twice, and this was back when it was still a rather new cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin At $1: Price Could Rally To $12 If History Repeats Itself As data from the CryptoRank website shows, the only years that the month of June has ended in the green for Dogecoin have been 2015 and 2016. Before that, June 2014 had closed in the red, with a loss of 21.4%, and after 2016, Dogecoin had racked up losses for the month of June every single year. From 2017 to 2024, Dogecoin has ended the month of June in the red every single time without fail. June 2017 ended in -2.38%, June 2018 ended in 27.2%, June 2019 ended in -4.36%, June 2020 ended in -9.94%, June 2021 ended in -23.9%, June 2022 ended in -23.3%, June 2023 ended in -7.18%, and June 2024 ended in -21.9%. Looking at the pattern here, it shows that even during bullish years, the month of June has not failed to end in losses for Dogecoin. Going by this established trend, it is not far off to expect the Dogecoin price to actually fall in the new month. With an average return of -7.34% over the years, making it the worst month in terms of returns for the meme coin, a decline could be in the works for the cryptocurrency. What To Expect From Here According to the machine learning algorithm at CoinCodex, the month of June may end up deviating from its established pattern. At the start, it does show a possible decline, expecting the price to fall below $0.22. However, as the month progresses, it is expected to turn around. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next The one-month prediction puts the Dogecoin price above $0.26, which is a 17.67% increase from the current price.

2025-05-29T09:24:17.000Z,"Best crypto to buy before May 31: Bitcoin Pepe nears $12.7M target","With just two days left before its exchange debut, Bitcoin Pepe has raised over $12.1 million of its $12.7 million target, making it one of the most closely watched meme coins in 2025. The current price of $0.0377 has drawn the attention of retail investors looking to enter before the token lists publicly on 31 May. Bitcoin Pepe is built on the Bitcoin network using the BRC-20 standard and introduces a novel upgrade called the PEP-20 protocol. The project aims to combine meme culture with faster, cheaper transaction functionality within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In contrast to Ethereum-based meme coins like Shiba Inu or Solana-native projects like Bonk, Bitcoin Pepe offers something different — a community-first token with zero taxes, a fixed supply of 420,690,000,000 BPEP, and a blockchain foundation based entirely on Bitcoin. The token’s contract ownership has been renounced, and liquidity pool tokens have been burned, ensuring no central control and full community governance. This approach has clearly resonated with crypto investors. With $12,139,893 raised at the time of writing, Bitcoin Pepe is just shy of reaching its presale goal. On platforms like Twitter and Telegram, excitement continues to grow as the countdown to listing enters its final stretch. Meme coin market strengthens as Bitcoin Pepe enters Bitcoin Pepe’s timing aligns with a broader meme coin resurgence in 2025. Established players like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have posted solid gains this year. Dogecoin, despite its uncapped supply and ageing infrastructure, continues to benefit from strong brand recognition and celebrity backing. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has expanded its ecosystem with staking, decentralised exchanges, and NFT integration — a sign of meme tokens maturing beyond their initial novelty. Solana’s Bonk has also re-emerged as a serious contender. After a successful comeback earlier this year, it was integrated into validator operations and partnered with other Solana-native applications, reinforcing its long-term vision. But unlike Bonk, which is deeply tied to Solana’s architecture, Bitcoin Pepe offers an entirely new use case by building meme coin infrastructure on top of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 standard is intended to offer Solana-like functionality — fast and inexpensive transactions — on Bitcoin. This could mark a significant shift in how Bitcoin is used beyond just a store of value, potentially unlocking more DeFi and meme-driven applications in its ecosystem. It also enables Bitcoin Pepe to serve not just as a meme token, but as a Layer-2 platform for future meme coin creation and trading on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Pepe vs Bonk, Dogecoin, and Sponge V2 With its upcoming listing, Bitcoin Pepe is drawing comparisons to other tokens that have capitalised on meme hype. Among them, Sponge V2 has generated attention for reviving a popular 2023 meme coin with new staking and play-to-earn features. Its pivot to gaming and utility has worked in its favour, attracting new users and rewarding long-term holders. However, Sponge V2 is still a rebrand and revival story. It does not offer the Layer-2 infrastructure or blockchain-native innovation that Bitcoin Pepe is introducing. Similarly, Bonk and Dogecoin — while more established — are increasingly viewed as legacy meme coins. They remain heavily dependent on existing sentiment and don’t introduce the same level of novelty in terms of blockchain functionality. Bitcoin Pepe , on the other hand, is actively building something new — a meme coin ecosystem that operates on Bitcoin itself. With zero tax, community-led governance, and innovative technology, the project has captured investor interest at a time when meme coins are dominating crypto headlines once again. As Bitcoin Pepe approaches its $12.7 million cap and exchange listing, its momentum suggests a potential breakout moment. Whether it can deliver on its long-term roadmap remains to be seen, but for now, it stands out as a high-upside crypto opportunity in the current market cycle.

2025-05-29T09:20:34.000Z,"Bitcoin Pepe presale hits $12.1M with 2 days to May 31 debut","Bitcoin Pepe is approaching its final presale milestone with just two days remaining until the long-awaited May 31 centralised exchange (CEX) listing. The project has already raised $12,139,762 of its $12,701,500 target, setting the stage for what could be one of the most significant meme coin launches of 2025. Built as a Layer 2 on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe blends the performance of Solana with the security of BTC, bringing the viral nature of meme coins directly to the world’s most trusted blockchain. At a time when investors are chasing the next breakout opportunity, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself as a serious contender. Its presale has attracted global attention, not only because of its meme-driven brand, but also due to its technological foundation, which includes the PEP-20 token standard. This standard allows meme coins to be issued natively on Bitcoin’s infrastructure—something previously thought impossible. As this final countdown begins, the token price remains at $0.0377, but that won’t last long. The PEP-20 standard is Bitcoin’s DeFi unlock While Bitcoin has long been considered “digital gold,” its capabilities for decentralised finance and token creation have lagged behind Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin Pepe aims to fix that. By introducing PEP-20, a new token standard for Bitcoin’s Layer 2, the project allows developers and communities to mint and trade meme coins directly on Bitcoin. That shift is not just about meme culture—it’s about functionality. With lower transaction fees, fast speeds, and the immutability of Bitcoin, the new Layer 2 infrastructure enables a seamless user experience similar to what investors enjoy on Solana. This opens the door to a flood of potential capital—nearly $2 trillion worth of BTC liquidity that has, until now, sat on the sidelines of DeFi and meme coin markets. Bitcoin Pepe isn’t just launching a coin; it’s laying the groundwork for an entire meme coin economy on Bitcoin. Strategic partnerships drive ecosystem use cases What separates Bitcoin Pepe from many other meme coins is its extensive ecosystem building. It’s not merely a speculative asset—it has been building partnerships that create real-world utility for its native token, BPEP. Among its partners is Plena Finance, a DeFi super app that plans to integrate BPEP into its platform for transactions and staking. GETE Network, a cross-chain gaming project, aims to embed BPEP into its gameplay mechanics. BETV, a short-form Web3 video platform, could use BPEP and PEP-20 tokens to reward content creators and manage fan engagement. From gaming to social content to decentralised finance, these integrations offer diverse entry points for BPEP beyond trading—positioning it as a functional token within emerging Web3 environments. Countdown to listing: Price set, window closing As the May 31 listing approaches, the final tokens are being sold at $0.0377. The presale structure is designed to reward early investors, with each completed stage increasing the token price by 5%. Those who joined in the early stages have already seen gains of more than 300% on paper. With only a small allocation of tokens left before the target is met, and the CEX listing just days away, this is the last chance to buy in before BPEP hits live trading markets. The launch is expected to attract significant volume, especially as the project is rumoured to be working with multiple major exchanges. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a full-stack Layer 2 solution bringing the virality of meme culture to Bitcoin’s solid foundation.

Now, the man crypto Twitter loves to hate is at it again, but not in the way you might think. After the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Schiff, who’s spent over a decade calling BTC a bubble made a statement on X no one saw coming: “I’m likely responsible for more people owning Bitcoin than any other individual.” Yes, really. In classic Schiff fashion, it was half insult, half self-awareness. “Every time I tell you not to buy Bitcoin, you buy more,” he quipped. But beneath the statement, there’s a deeper tension – because while Schiff might joke about driving adoption, he’s more convinced than ever that Bitcoin is doing real damage. Let’s unpack his perspective. Cult Status? Schiff Still Isn’t Buying It Schiff didn’t hold back on his usual takedown of Bitcoin’s fundamentals. He insists there’s been no real wealth creation, just redistribution. “What has happened is a massive transfer of wealth from those who bought Bitcoin and crypto early to those who bought later.” And in a line that sums up his long-running stance, he doubled down on his favorite comparison: The Bitcoin community, he said, is like “a giant cult.” It’s the kind of remark that’s guaranteed to spark outrage. The Fed, Bitcoin, and a Fight Over the Future Schiff’s recent outburst came just yesterday. He publicly slammed a new Bitcoin acquisition bill introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis. The proposal suggests the U.S. government could use Federal Reserve funds to buy Bitcoin – potentially hundreds of billions worth. To Schiff, this is economic sabotage. “A Selfish Attempt to Enrich the Few” He argues that the bill is designed to pump the bags of early Bitcoin adopters while leaving average Americans to deal with the fallout. He argues this would only deepen the inflation crisis and destabilize the economy. And if it passes? Schiff had a harsh warning for Capitol Hill: “No member of Congress who initiated the Bitcoin buy plan is worthy of re-election.” Is Schiff Bitcoin’s Greatest Salesman? Here’s the kicker: the more Peter Schiff rails against Bitcoin, the more attention – and adoption – it seems to get. Like it or not, he’s part of the narrative now.

ETH record open interest, rising funding rates and consistent inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs fuel the rally. A classic bullish continuation pattern suggests a potential 46% climb toward $4,000 as ETH reclaims key support. Ether’s ( ETH ) price topped $2,780 on May 29 for the first time since Feb. 24. Ether was trading at $2,722 at the time of publication, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours and 50% over the last 30 days.

Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Let’s look at the factors driving the ETH price up today. ETH open interest hits all-time highs Besides ETH’s price strength, Ether futures open interest (OI) hit a record high on May 29. This suggests that large investors are positioning for a potential rally toward $3,000 . Ether futures aggregate open interest, ETH. Source: CoinGlass The aggregate OI in Ether futures rose 17% over five days, hitting a record $37.3 billion on May 29. Binance, Gate.io, Bybit, and Bitget collectively dominate 51% of the market, while the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) holds 8% of ETH open interest, according to CoinGlass data. Also backing Ether’s upside are positive funding rates in ETH perpetual futures markets. Funding rates represent the periodic payments exchanged between long and short-position holders. This metric has increased to 0.0050% from $0.0090% over the same period. ETH funding rates across all exchanges. Source: CoinGlass This rise in OI shows more traders are entering the market and opening new positions. Higher funding rates indicate that more traders are going long (betting on higher prices) and are willing to pay to keep those positions open. Both metrics signal bullish bias among ETH futures traders. Ether price boosted by high ETF inflows Adding to Ether’s bullish momentum on May 29 is the significant inflows into US-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the last week. These investment products have recorded positive inflows for eight straight days, totaling $394.1 million, according to data from SoSoValue. Spot Ethereum ETF flows. Source: SoSoValue BlackRock’s ETHA fund, which witnessed net inflows since May 14, was the primary driver behind Ethereum ETF capital positive flows, with a total of $287.6 million in inflows over the last two weeks. Additional data from CoinShares shows increased inflows across global Ethereum investment products, with $326.2 million between May 19 and May 23. This points to an increased institutional appetite for spot Ethereum ETFs and other investment products, which is a positive catalyst for the ETH price.

The pattern was confirmed when the price closed above the flag’s upper boundary at $2,650 on May 27, signaling the start of a massive upward move.

The city of Richmond in Virginia says that starting May 27th, residents can apply for the fourth cohort of the Richmond Resilience Initiative (RRI) Guaranteed Basic Income (GBI) program. For this batch, the RRI will focus on supporting single parents, including guardians with custody, step parents, foster parents and other primary household caregivers. The city says eligible beneficiaries will receive $500 per month for 24 months with no strings attached. The RRI aims to improve financial stability among working families. The city says the program is part of a growing national movement that seeks to demonstrate the power of direct, unrestricted cash assistance in helping families attain greater financial independence and reduce stress. According to Richmond’s Office of Community Wealth Building (OCWB), those who participated in the RRI program used their monthly payments to meet essential needs, pay debts, invest in education and create stability for their families. Says Richmond Mayor Danny Avula, “The Richmond Resilience Initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to creating a city where families have the stability and support they need to build a better future. This is about trust, dignity, and ensuring our residents have the resources to move forward with confidence.” The application is open until June 30th.

2025-05-29T09:07:59.000Z,"New investors are turning to RUVI instead of BTC, the reason might surprise you","For years, Bitcoin has been the go-to investment for those looking to dip their toes into the cryptocurrency world. But now, a new contender is stealing its thunder. Ruvi AI, a revolutionary blockchain project that combines artificial intelligence and decentralization, is becoming the talk of the town for savvy investors. And the reasons for this shift might just surprise you. Bitcoin’s challenges in today’s market Bitcoin has long been hailed as the “gold standard” of cryptocurrencies. It’s widely recognized, highly valuable, and has withstood the test of time. However, its high entry price and slower growth potential present hurdles to new investors. For example, as of today, Bitcoin is trading at over $100,000 per coin. While its historical returns are impressive, its current valuation makes it inaccessible for many. To make matters worse, its growth has plateaued compared to its early years, leaving limited room for the life-changing returns it once delivered. This has left a gap in the market for projects that offer more affordable entry points and the potential for exponential growth. Enter Ruvi AI. What makes Ruvi AI different? Unlike Bitcoin, Ruvi AI is a new blockchain project geared towards solving real-world problems using a powerful combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. This decentralized AI platform is designed to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, logistics, and finance, setting it apart from legacy cryptocurrencies that lack such specialized applications. What truly sets Ruvi AI apart, though, is its affordable entry price and staggering growth potential.

2025-05-29T09:03:23.000Z,"Why Gold and Bitcoin Are Gaining Power Again","Right now, something big is happening with the world’s money system—but it’s not being talked about loudly. Instead of central banks like the Federal Reserve creating money directly, banks themselves are stepping in by buying short-term government debt. When banks do this, their own balance sheets grow, which means more money is flowing into the economy. This creates liquidity , a fancy word for available cash—and that often boosts the prices of assets like Bitcoin and gold . This kind of money expansion also happened in the 1970s, and back then, it led to high inflation. The lesson from that time? When the value of money drops, it’s smart to own things that hold real value—like gold. Now, we’re seeing something similar today. In the U.S., the government has been spending heavily, but instead of selling long-term debt, it's mainly selling short-term bills, which are easier for banks to buy. This makes money flow faster into financial markets. At the same time, China is adding more money to its system too. But instead of trying to keep its currency strong, China is letting it weaken against gold —a sign that it’s focusing on real assets rather than paper money. All this means one thing: money is losing value , not in stores just yet, but in the financial system. That’s why gold and Bitcoin are climbing. They are not tied to any one country’s debt or currency and are often seen as safe havens when trust in government money falls. So, while bond markets are under pressure from rising debt and interest rates, people who want to protect their savings are turning to Bitcoin and gold . These are the assets that benefit when governments quietly print more money or rely on banks to do it for them.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/why-gold-and-bitcoin-are-gaining-power-again,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET","",cryptocompare

The company issued $21 million in zero-interest bonds to purchase additional Bitcoin. The company noted that the zero-interest bonds will have a face value of $525,000 per bond. Metaplanet acknowledged in its notice of issuance that it may redeem a corresponding multiple of Bonds at $1 per $1 of face value if it contributes enough money in future fundraisings. Metaplanet continues its Bitcoin purchases *Metaplanet Issues 21 Million USD in 0% Ordinary Bonds to Purchase Additional $BTC * pic.twitter.com/uQKEQSBN9S — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) May 29, 2025 Metaplanet is adding more Bitcoin with zero-interest bonds, continuing its string of debt-funded buys as it nears the 10,000 BTC goal by the end of 2025. The company issued its latest $21 million bonds on May 29, which it revealed will be repaid on November 28. The bonds are similar to obtaining a loan but with zero interest, meaning Metaplanet receives funds at no added cost until maturity. Metaplanet noted that the bond deal includes flexible repayment terms. One term is that EVO FUND can request its money back early, provided the investor receives at least five business days’ notice, providing an exit option if needed. The firm has raised capital through several bond issuances this year, including $25.9 million in February, $13.3 million in late March, and $25 million earlier this month. Its latest issuance follows another notice just a day earlier for a separate amount of $50 million. The company said in its May 28 announcement it’s raising $50M through bonds, which will be issued in $1.25 million denominations and will carry on interest. The investment firm noted that investors will not receive regular payments, with any potential profit expected to come from the bonds’ redemption value. The Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed company’s total debt raised this year has reached roughly $135.2 million. Metaplanet acquired another 696 BTC in late March through a combination of exercised cash-secured put options and premiums from selling those options. The firm said it acquired the coins as part of its Bitcoin Income Generation strategy, which involves selling put options and using the collateral to purchase Bitcoin at an effective discount. Metaplanet’s strategy generated $5.1 million in premiums in Q1 2025 alone, an 11.4% increase from the previous quarter. The strategy also helped the company to acquire Bitcoin at an effective price of just $88,800 per coin, below market rates at the time of execution. Metaplanet also appointed President Trump’s son, Eric Trump, to its Strategic Advisory Board in the same month. The firm expects Eric to bring his experience in real estate, finance, and brand development to assist its drive in Bitcoin adoption. At the time of publication, data showed that the company now ranks as the 11th biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The data also revealed that Metaplanet currently holds 7,800 Bitcoin, which accounts for 78% of its goal. The Japanese investment firm’s record holdings are currently worth approximately $841.85 million, purchased at an average price of $91,340 per BTC. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at around $108,000, a 13.89% increase from the last month. Metaplanet plans to establish a U.S. subsidiary Metaplanet announced on May 1 plans to launch a wholly owned subsidiary in Florida. The company acknowledged that it aims to raise $250 million for its new subsidiary. “With planned capital of up to $250 million, this move will accelerate its Bitcoin treasury strategy and serve as a crucial step in expanding access to liquidity for institutional investors in one of the world’s leading capital markets.” – Simon Gerovich , CEO of Metaplanet. The Japanese investment firm said it will operate its new entity as Metaplanet Treasury Corp. to expand its access to U.S. institutional investors and bolster 24-hour operations across time zones. Gerovich noted that the company chose Florida because it is rapidly emerging as a global hub for Bitcoin innovation, corporate adoption, and financial liberation. The investment company believes the move will strengthen its continuous operational capabilities and solidify its position in the U.S. market. Florida’s state business registry shows the records of the company’s Treasury Corp.

2025-05-29T09:01:05.000Z,"Cardano News: Can These 2 Factors Fuel a $10 ADA?","TL;DR After sitting on the sidelines for a few weeks, Cardano whales have gone on an accumulation spree, purchasing over 180,000,000 ADA within the past seven-day period. The team behind the layer-1 blockchain announced a big integration yesterday of Bitcoin Ordinals, which, according to analysts, could also fuel a substantial price reversal. Whales Start Buying Again As the largest market participants, especially for cryptocurrencies that lack ETFs or other funds allowing institutional exposure through regulated financial vehicles, whales’ actions are particularly significant for altcoins’ price movements. ADA’s price is also highly susceptible to whether they buy or sell in massive quantities, as evident in late February when they were disposing of their assets, and the asset plunged. However, data shared by Ali Martinez showcases a more promising current picture as they have accumulated over 180,000,000 ADA in the past week alone. In terms of USD value, this stash is equivalent to $135 million at today’s prices. The picture below indicates that whales’ holdings have surpassed 13 billion ADA, which is more than a third of the entire available token supply (35.33 billion, according to CoinMarketCap). Whales have bought over 180 million #Cardano $ADA in just the past week! pic.twitter.com/hOmii47pKo — Ali (@ali_charts) May 29, 2025 Bitcoin Ordinals Integration Aside from whales filling their bags, which is considered a highly bullish development, another factor that could reverse ADA’s price trajectory is the growth and development of the network behind the token. IOG announced such a big move yesterday, as Bitcoin Ordinals can now be wrapped and bridged to the Cardano blockchain via Fairgate’s BitVMX framework. According to the statement, this marks a “significant advancement in decentralized finance, enabling seamless interaction between two of the most prominent blockchain systems.” “The future of DeFi is cross-chain, and BitVMX exemplifies how Bitcoin can be a foundational layer in this evolution,” said Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IO. “By combining Cardano’s flexibility with Bitcoin’s security, we open the door to entirely new financial instruments and services.” Dan Gambardello, a popular YouTuber and X content creator, praised the move and highlighted that it is a part of the ingredients for a potential ADA price surge to $10.

Speaking on Wednesday at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, he said that New York is the Empire State and “we build empires. Come back home,” he called crypto businesses, encouraging to come back to the city. “It’s time for the first time in the history of the city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he addressed the gathering. “I believe we need to have a BitBond, and I am going to push and fight to get a BitBond in New York, so you can do safe bond investments in NYC.” BREAKING: NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS JUST ANNOUNCED HE'S GOING \""TO FIGHT TO GET A BITBOND IN NEW YORK\"" THIS IS MASSIVE pic.twitter.com/8Ix0spHEOf — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 “Let’s eliminate the BitLicense”: Mayor The New York BitLicense, a regulatory framework for crypto firms in the city, has faced significant criticism from the community. Critics have urged the state to get rid of BitLicense “right away,” to “create opportunities for growth and innovation.” Some argue that its strict requirements could stifle innovation or drive companies out of New York. The Office of the New York Comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, has also previously raised his voice against the management of the BitLicense scheme. “Come back home, you have a mayor that is the crypto mayor, is the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the city of New York,” Adam stated. “Where you won’t be attacked and criminalized. Let’s get rid of the Bitcoin license and allow us to free flow of Bitcoin in our city.” NYC to Use Bitcoin Blockchain for Birth Certificates On a concluding note, the mayor said that New York would use Bitcoin and blockchain for birth certificates. “We are going to use Bitcoin to pay off fines and taxes. We are going to allow our young people to understand what it is to be part of this industry, but we need you on the ground,” he added. “The message is clear: get out there and show your power.

With a highly leveraged Bitcoin (BTC) long position hanging in the balance, Wynn’s destiny could be decided with his next trade. From Meme Coins to Million-Dollar Trades Wynn is well-known for his bold trading style, frequently placing large bets on meme and relatively lesser-known tokens. According to data from EmberCN, in mid-May he placed a tight trade on Trump (TRUMP) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and gained $11.67 million from May 12–13. The hot streak didn’t last long, though. On May 23, Wynn’s long ETH and Sui (SUI) positions turned against him and lost him $5.29 million. Then, an epic comeback. On May 24, Wynn recorded a whopping $42.08 million profit on longs for Bitcoin and PEPE. The profits did not hold, though. Between May 25–27, his BTC short and PEPE long combination failed, burning $16.72 million. $200M Bitcoin Bet on the Brink Wynn is now long 1,840 BTC at a notional value of approximately $200.3 million, with 40x leverage. His entry was $109,228, and his liquidation price is $102,257—just 6% below the current BTC price of $108,874. The trade is already showing an unrealized loss of $718,098. A further drop in BTC would not just wipe out recent profits, but also principal capital Wynn has put into this trade. Defiant in the Face of Danger Despite looming losses, Wynn has not lost his swagger. In a biting tweet to naysayers, he tweeted: “For all my haters out there who so very much enjoyed watching my portfolio swing down by $60,000,000… just know, now you get to watch it swing BACK UP INTO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS…” Wynn appears unfazed, even energized by the high-risk world he inhabits. Whale Wallet Suggests Strategic Change On-chain analytics software The Data Nerd has linked Wynn to a whale wallet which recently moved 44.337 billion PEPE tokens, valued at $6.17 million, to Binance. Acquired at a micro-entry point, the position was reported to have returned 11,117x. The move may indicate Wynn is preparing to rotate funds or hedge further losses, utilizing the massive profit from his PEPE position. Will the Gamble Pay Off? Wynn’s risky approach has earned him wealth as well as derision. With liquidation staring in the face now, the crypto world is watching with bated breath. Whether he manages another unlikely turnaround or faces a catastrophic blowup remains to be witnessed.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/james-wynns-high-stakes-crypto-gamble-nears/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|ZRX|PEPE","Blockchain|Bitcoin|Regulation",cryptocompare

You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said.“I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.”New York City Mayor Eric Adams wants a Bitcoin bond and to axe the State BitLicense program. BitSource: YouTubeAdams didn’t share details about how a Bitbond would work; however, a March 31 policy brief paper from advocacy group the Bitcoin Policy Institute proposed a model where holders receive an annual interest rate of 1% for 10 years.When the bond matures, holders also receive a percentage of any Bitcoin market gains. At the same time, 90% of the funds raised through the bonds are allocated to government spending, while 10% is used to purchase Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s bond policy brief.Adams again pushes to axe BitLicenseAdams also called for repealing New York’s BitLicense program, which the state launched in 2015 ﻿and requires crypto businesses to apply for a license with the New York Department of Financial Services and meet strict compliance standards.The BitLicense program has received criticism from the industry, and Adams has also said the measure is too costly with high licensing fees, and is too stringent with its Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures. “You have a mayor who is the crypto mayor, is the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the city of New York, where you won’t be attacked and criminalized,” he said.“Let’s get rid of the Bitcoin license and allow us to have the free flow of Bitcoin in our city.”Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summitUSDC stablecoin issuer Circle was one of the first crypto companies to receive a BitLicense; others have since followed, including crypto exchange Coinbase and trading firm Bakkt.Adams has been actively pushing to attract crypto firms to New York City.

Source: CoinMarketCapThe Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed.“It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.”On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers, levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10%.Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified.“The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, really — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said, “Buy everything round dos.”Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrowCrypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said, “So Trump tariffs are illegal?

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewOnce SOL price enters price discovery, bullish momentum could target the 1.618 extension, suggesting SOL could reach as high as $418.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

If the pattern plays out, the trader warned that SOL could revisit $157 to $152 in the short term.The $180 level remains the critical inflection point.

2025-05-28T22:20:00.000Z,"Ethereum bulls aim for $2.7K ahead of ETH’s $2.4B options expiry","Key takeaways:97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share. Ethereum no longer ranks among the top ten protocols in terms of fees, creating a supply imbalance that contributes to inflationary pressure on ETH.Sell (put) options ill-prepared for ETH prices above $2,600ETH options aggregate open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $2,300 and $2,500: $420 million in calls (buy) vs. $220 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $200 million.Between $2,500 and $2,600: $500 million calls vs. $130 million puts, favoring calls by $370 million.Between $2,600 and $2,700: $590 million calls vs. $35 million puts, favoring calls by $555 million.Between $2,700 and $2,900: $780 million calls vs. $10 million puts, favoring calls by $770 million.Bulls are strongly incentivized to push ETH past $2,700, yet the broader context may override those efforts. Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”“We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats,” said US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. The Labor Department under Biden criticized the practice of marketing cryptocurrencies to 401(k) participants. At the time, the agency claimed cryptocurrencies posed “significant risks and challenges” to participants’ retirement accounts due to their “speculative and volatile” nature and “valuation concerns,” among other reasons.The American Banking Association (ABA) criticized the 2022 compliance release, claiming that it did not make the guidance available for public comment and review prior to issuance.Related: Fidelity introduces retirement accounts with minimal-fee crypto investingTrump administration shifts crypto landscapePresident Trump has pledged to make the United States “the world capital of crypto” during his 2024 campaign.Under his administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has scaled back several enforcement actions and investigations involving Web3 companies such as Uniswap, Coinbase, and Kraken, while also engaging in policy discussions on topics like real-world asset tokenization and the regulatory status of certain tokens.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5.

This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved. And when in doubt, always verify before sending funds.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/elderly-crypto-investors-are-getting-scammed-teach-them-these-key-safety-tips?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

He added that he is confident many of those investors will cycle back into the crypto market to fuel the next big rally.2. Smart money agrees on Bitcoin’s year-end targetSeveral analysts have set $200,000 as their target for Bitcoin in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices.Kendrick said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins.Related: A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route“The US Senate… voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act,” Kendrick wrote in the email note. “The point of the stablecoin Act is that stablecoins will further legitimise the whole asset class.

2025-05-28T13:33:33.000Z,"UK FCA requests public comments on stablecoin, crypto custody regulation","The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has requested public feedback on proposed regulations for stablecoins and cryptocurrency custody.In a May 28 request for comment, the United Kingdom’s financial regulator announced that its regulatory proposals are “the latest milestone on the road to crypto regulation.” The draft rules are based on prior roundtables and industry feedback. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets. At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.”The FCA also noted it will work with the UK’s central bank to regulate stablecoins. Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said, “For those stablecoins that expect to operate at systemic scale, the Bank of England will publish a complementary consultation paper later this year.”Related: UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini reportEnsuring stablecoins remain stableThe FCA said that its rules “aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value.” The regulator said customers must be clearly informed about how the backing assets are managed. It also recommended that stablecoin issuers appoint independent third-party custodians to hold reserve assets:“We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency, irrespective of the value of the backing assets portfolio, with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.“Breeden added that the FCA’s proposals are part of a broader effort to build the UK’s stablecoin regime.Related: UK to require crypto firms to report every customer transactionCrypto custody rules incomingThe FCA’s proposals also introduce new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services, as outlined in a separate discussion paper.

It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT monthly sales.

In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech.

My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
