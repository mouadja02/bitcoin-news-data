2025-05-29T18:45:46.000Z,"Citigroup’s Equity Strategist Says $2,000,000,000,000 Deficit Is Good for Economy and S&P 500 Earnings – Here’s Why","Citigroup’s US equity strategist Scott Chronert says the ballooning US budget deficit could have a positive impact on the economy. In a new CNBC interview, Chronert says that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act recently passed in the U.S. House of Representatives will have zero effect on reducing the budget deficit. According to the equity strategist, financing the budget deficit will have a stimulative effect on the economy. “ We think that the proposal as it came out of the House adds another $600 billion or so to next year’s deficit. Now that’s the bad news. The good news is we actually now have tariffs beginning to kick in. And our math is that tariffs could offset about $200 billion of that. So what ends up happening, all told, is that you go from this TCJA (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) extension, some puts and takes in terms of some tax, other tax cuts, some modest spending reductions, the tariff income and you’re back to about a $2 trillion deficit, which is where we are this year. What that does from our perspective is two things – it means that financing this deficit is going to require ongoing higher treasury issuance, which means higher interest rates, potentially valuation overhang. On the other side, though, it’s still a positive fiscal impulse, which is net good for the economy, economic conditions. And most importantly, S&P 500 earnings.” Chronert, however, warns that expansionary fiscal conditions could negatively impact stock prices. “At the end of the day, higher rates presumably from a discounting of future cash flows perspective draws down or keeps a lid on where equity market valuations can go.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The “change the code, not the climate” campaign sought to pressure key industry leaders, Bitcoin miners, and influencers into moving over to a new consensus mechanism and ditch proof-of-work (PoW). Changing The Bitcoin Code — Mission Impossible? In early 2023, Chris Larsen’s Greenpeace teamed up with art activist Benjamin Von Wong for its “change the code, not the climate” campaign to convert Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism to a less energy-consuming model. The campaign at the time claimed that proof-of-stake was much less environmentally harmful due to its lower energy consumption. In a recent post on X, Larsen clarified that his primary objective while funding the campaign was to “turn Bitcoin into an accelerator for direct air capture.” He acknowledged that the $5 million campaign failed; however, he indicated that Ripple had not financed it. Moreover, the former Ripple CEO noted that Bitcoin has witnessed a “remarkable” energy transition in recent years, with mining now mainly relying on renewable sources such as hydropower, nuclear, and wind, based on a recent study conducted by the University of Cambridge. It’s worth mentioning that Greenpeace commissioned Canadian Art activist Benjamin Von Wong to create a unique art piece dubbed the “Skull of Satoshi” — an 11-foot skull featuring the Bitcoin logo and red laser eyes, a nod to the Bitcoin Twitter community who wear laser eyes in their profile pictures. Smokestacks growing out of the top the skull, which is made of recycled electronic waste, aimed to represent the “fossil fuel and coal pollution” caused by Bitcoin mining and the “millions of computers” used to validate network transactions. Instead of infuriating die-hard Bitcoin supporters, the Skull was ironically embraced by many because it was so “ badass ”. Ripple donated the Skull to the Bitcoin community.

2025-05-29T18:34:50.000Z,"SOL Strategies Files Prospectus To Raise Up To $1 Billion To Boost Its Solana Investment","Canada-listed Sol Strategies filed a preliminary base shelf prospectus on Tuesday to expand its capital-raising flexibility as it deepens its investment in the world’s sixth-largest cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL). SOL Strategies Files $1 Billion Shelf Prospectus In its Tuesday press release, SOL Strategies stated that the filing and final approval of the prospectus would allow it to offer up to $1 billion in a variety of instruments, including common shares, debt securities, warrants, and subscription receipts. The prospectus was submitted to securities regulators in all Canadian provinces and territories, and once finalized, it will give the firm flexibility to act quickly on future opportunities in the Solana ecosystem without delay due to further regulatory greenlight. “The filing of a base shelf prospectus supports our growth strategy by providing us with the flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem,” said SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald. However, the company, which trades on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the ticker HODL, indicated that it currently does not have immediate plans to issue securities under the shelf prospectus, and may never pursue such an issuance. A few weeks ago, Sol Strategies announced that it had secured a $500 million convertible note facility to fund additional SOL buys. In a follow-up press release, the company said it spent its entire first tranche of $20 million from the financing to acquire 122,524 SOL. Companies Move Into Solana Sol Strategies rebranded in 2024 from Cypherpunk Holdings — a holding company initially focused on investing in Bitcoin and crypto-related equities — to concentrate on its Solana investment strategy. The move reflects the growing institutional confidence in Solana’s high-speed, low-cost network. Solana remains one of the top cryptocurrencies, with a valuation of around $89.9 billion. The asset is trading down slightly on the day to $172.80, CoinGecko data shows. Sol Strategies is not the only company receiving debt to buy SOL. In April, Nasdaq-listed Upexi disclosed a $100 million raise aimed at creating a Solana reserve.

2025-05-29T18:32:49.000Z,"Pakistan To Launch Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Amid Global Race For Digital Gold","In a landmark announcement on May 28, a crypto advisor to Pakistan revealed that the government is planning to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Pakistan’s move reflects the wider trend of nation-states embracing pro-crypto policies following the regulatory shift in Washington, DC under the President Donald Trump administration. Pakistan Follows The US In Embracing Bitcoin Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Bilal Bin Saqib, the newly appointed special assistant to the prime minister on blockchain and cryptocurrency, said that Pakistan’s government is “setting up its own Bitcoin strategic reserve.” “Today is a very historic day. Today, I announce the Pakistani government is setting up its own government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and we want to thank the United States of America again because we were inspired by them,” the crypto-centric minister of state opined. In March 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order paving the way for the creation of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate digital assets stockpile. Trump’s nascent plan for a Bitcoin reserve will — at least at first — be made up of the U.S. government’s BTC stash from criminal and civil forfeitures, estimated to hover around 198,000 coins. While the US leads in holdings, other countries like Bhutan , El Salvador , and North Korea are also quietly building their Bitcoin reserves. Similar to the US’s Bitcoin strategic reserve, Bin Saquib said that the Pakistani government would not sell its BTC. “This wallet, the national bitcoin wallet, is not for speculation or hype. We will be holding these bitcoins and we will never, ever sell them,” Bin Saqib postulated. From Crypto Ban To Bitcoin Mining Boom In addition to establishing a strategic reserve, Bin Saqiib disclosed that the Pakistan government has allocated 2,000 megawatts of excess electricity for Bitcoin mining and high-performance AI data centers. “We want to welcome all miners to come to Pakistan, all the infrastructure players to come to Pakistan and build with us,” Bin Saqib said. The announcement marks a sharp reversal from the government of Pakistan’s previous stance on cryptocurrencies, where it sought to ban all cryptocurrency services operating in the country and never legalize crypto trading. The government first contemplated the formation of a “National Crypto Council” in February 2025 to oversee the creation of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and to draw in foreign investment. The Pakistan Crypto Council in April tapped Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao as a Strategic Advisor amid its push to accelerate its digital finance transformation.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/pakistan-to-launch-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-amid-global-race-for-digital-gold/,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|pakistan",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T18:26:07.000Z,"Critical Ethereum Report from JPMorgan: Can ETH Recover?","JPMorgan analysts explained that Ethereum’s (ETH) recent upgrades have had positive effects on its price and market cap but have not meaningfully increased on-chain activity. The report, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director of JPMorgan, stated that the Pectra upgrade, which took place earlier this month, made Ethereum more attractive to institutional investors. Pectra brings together several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that offer improvements such as increasing staking efficiency, increasing rewards, and faster deposits/withdrawals. The report noted that Ethereum’s adoption of security token standards such as ERC-3643 and ERC-1400 is also part of a strategy to increase institutional interest. These standards include regulatory compliance features such as know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks, making Ethereum more compatible with traditional financial infrastructure. For example, the support of institutions such as the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which plays a key role in the US securities clearing system, strengthens this strategy. Related News: BREAKING: FED Chair Jerome Powell Holds Surprise Meeting with US President Donald Trump! Here are the Details Analysts stated that this institutional orientation of Ethereum is similar to the interest of institutional and corporate investors increasing the interest in Bitcoin. It was stated that with this orientation of Ethereum, individual users are concentrated and it differentiates itself from rival platforms that stand out with memecoin activities. Ethereum’s CME futures positions also support this institutional transformation. According to JPMorgan’s institutional flow indicator, open interest and price action in CME ETH futures indicate that long positions from institutional investors are increasing. However, limited inflows into spot ETH ETFs suggest weak retail investor interest, especially when compared to the strong demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs following Donald Trump’s election victory. On the other hand, despite all these institutional steps, it was stated that there was no significant increase in Ethereum's on-chain basic metrics. While there was no significant increase in the number of daily transactions and active addresses, it was stated that although the total value locked (TVL) increased in terms of ETH, the growth in dollar terms remained limited. Finally, JPMorgan analysts pointed out that ETH transaction fees have decreased with the widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and that there has also been an increase in the circulating supply of ETH since the Dencun upgrade, and that when combined with low transaction activity, Ethereum risks becoming inflationary again. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-29T18:06:05.000Z,"Nigel Farage to Pitch UK as ‘Crypto Powerhouse’ at Bitcoin 2025","Key Takeaways: Reform UK leader Nigel Farage will present a draft crypto bill during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. The bill proposes cutting capital gains tax on crypto to 10%, creating a regulatory sandbox, and outlawing payment discrimination. Reform claims crypto ownership is rising among young voters, with 25% of 18–34-year-olds holding digital assets. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage will present a draft cryptocurrency bill in Las Vegas on Thursday, calling for a lower tax rate on crypto profits and new legal protections for digital payments, according to a report published by Bloomberg on May 29. The proposal includes reducing capital gains tax on crypto assets to 10% from 24%, introducing a two-year regulatory sandbox for financial services, and banning service discrimination based on payment method. I will be speaking at @TheBitcoinConf from 10pm UK time. One-in-four 18 to 34 years olds own crypto. Reform will take them seriously. https://t.co/LgyJdZ6FFe — Nigel Farage MP (@Nigel_Farage) May 29, 2025 Farage Links Bitcoin to Financial Autonomy Farage is scheduled to outline the plan during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, where his party says he will push to make the UK a “crypto powerhouse.” The measure is the first prepared legislation to be announced by Reform and comes as the party has gained in national polling, despite holding only five seats in Parliament. “Seven million people in the UK now hold crypto, including one in four people aged 18-34,” Reform said in a statement. “Not a single legacy party has taken them seriously, but Reform will.” Farage, a former metals trader and longtime supporter of Bitcoin, has described the asset as a tool for resisting centralized control. His event biography links digital currency adoption to personal autonomy and frames it as a rejection of surveillance and monetary policy decisions. According to the report, his stance contrasts with the Bank of England’s more cautious approach to unbacked crypto assets. While previous officials have explored tokenized payment systems like a potential digital pound, they have warned against the volatility of assets such as Bitcoin. UK Crypto Regulation Lags Behind Despite Market Activity Labour leader Keir Starmer criticized the announcement, likening it to the economic policies of former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Reform plans to hold a media briefing in London on Friday to release the full bill. While the UK has taken steps to regulate the crypto industry, progress has been slow and fragmented. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) oversees crypto asset promotions and registration, but comprehensive legislation governing the broader sector has yet to be implemented. Industry groups have repeatedly called for clearer guidance, particularly on stablecoins and decentralized platforms. Some fintech executives have warned that delays in regulation could cause the UK to fall behind jurisdictions like the European Union, where the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework is already being rolled out. Despite these hurdles, the UK remains an active crypto market. London continues to host a concentration of blockchain startups, trading platforms, and venture capital firms. Activity is particularly strong in tokenization, gaming assets, and compliance tools. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) How does Reform’s approach compare to the EU’s crypto strategy? While the EU is implementing the MiCA framework, which covers stablecoins, service providers, and consumer protection, the UK has not passed a similarly comprehensive law. Reform’s bill attempts to close that gap with a faster, more targeted approach. What are the legal implications of banning service discrimination based on crypto payments? Such a ban would compel financial and commercial institutions to accommodate crypto transactions, raising questions about enforcement, liability, and compatibility with existing anti-money laundering laws. Could Farage’s bill influence other parties or future legislation? If public interest continues to grow and polling support holds, other UK parties may be pressured to respond with their own crypto positions or adopt elements of the bill in broader financial reform discussions.

2025-05-29T18:00:16.000Z,"This Latest Announcement Suggests XRP Could Be Part of U.S. Strategic Digital Asset Reserve","A new wave of excitement has swept across the crypto community following a claim shared by Amelie on X, referencing an announcement from VivoPower International PLC. According to Amelie, XRP is anticipated to be one of the five digital assets earmarked for accumulation by the U.S. government as part of President Trump’s recently unveiled Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile initiative . If confirmed, this would mark a historic milestone for XRP and the broader digital asset industry, signaling an unprecedented level of federal recognition and participation in the crypto space. „ #XRP IS EXPECTED TO BE ONE OF FIVE DIGITAL ASSETS THAT WILL BE ACCUMULATED BY THE US GOVERNMENT AS PART OF PRESIDENT TRUMP’S RECENTLY ANNOUNCED STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE & UNITED STATES DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE!“ https://t.co/HduXTt2LFj pic.twitter.com/kuJdXPaJd1 — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 29, 2025 A Shift in U.S. Crypto Strategy The reported plan, which places XRP alongside Bitcoin in a national strategic reserve, underscores a dramatic evolution in how the United States is approaching blockchain-based assets. Historically, U.S. regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC have maintained a cautious, and at times adversarial, stance toward cryptocurrencies, particularly concerning issues of security classification, investor protection, and market integrity. However, President Trump’s strategy, as highlighted by VivoPower and amplified by Amelie, suggests a major policy pivot: one that recognizes the growing global importance of digital assets not just as speculative instruments but as national strategic resources. This mirrors how governments have traditionally treated commodities like gold, oil, or foreign currency reserves. Why XRP? Understanding Its Unique Appeal While Bitcoin often dominates headlines as the “digital gold,” XRP brings its own distinct set of attributes that make it attractive for institutional and governmental accumulation. Developed by Ripple Labs, XRP is designed for ultra-fast , low-cost cross-border transactions . Its underlying technology, the XRP Ledger (XRPL), offers superior scalability and energy efficiency compared to many proof-of-work chains, positioning it as a strong candidate for institutional use. Additionally, XRP’s long-standing reputation as a payments-focused asset aligns with the goals of a digital reserve designed to enhance financial flexibility, global payment efficiency, and liquidity management at a national level. Including XRP in the U.S. digital asset stockpile would not only diversify the reserve but also reinforce America’s competitiveness in the fast-evolving global fintech landscape. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Impact on the Market The speculation that XRP could become part of an official U.S. government reserve has already stirred anticipation among investors and market observers. Such a move would represent unprecedented institutional validation, likely driving renewed demand and potentially reshaping the token’s regulatory narrative. While XRP has spent years entangled in legal battles, notably the ongoing saga between Ripple and the SEC, inclusion in a federal asset reserve would symbolize a seismic shift in perception. It could provide XRP with a legitimacy boost that not only attracts institutional capital but also prompts reassessment by regulators worldwide. A New Era for Digital Assets? Amelie’s post has sparked a wave of discussion within the crypto community, many of whom see this development as a sign that the United States is finally moving from a reactive to a proactive stance on crypto policy. If the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve expands to a broader United States Digital Asset Stockpile encompassing assets like XRP, it could catalyze a new era of government-backed digital asset strategies, potentially influencing allies, trade partners, and global financial markets. For now, the crypto world watches closely, awaiting formal confirmation and further details. But one thing is certain: the prospect of XRP playing a central role in America’s digital asset future is no longer just a speculative dream; it’s emerging as a tangible, high-stakes possibility.

2025-05-29T18:00:00.000Z,"From Bitcoin Highs to Altcoin Rotation: Why Traders Are Moving Into Dogecoin and SEI in 2025","High-Cap Coins Hit Pause — Rotation Begins With Bitcoin trading between $107,000 and $109,000 and Solana hovering just below $180 , seasoned traders are beginning to adjust their exposure. As market leaders show signs of short-term fatigue, momentum is quietly shifting toward selective altcoins — notably Dogecoin , SEI , and the fast-rising MAGACOIN FINANCE . Bitcoin’s Strategic Shift and Market Uncertainty Bitcoin’s price remains strong near record highs, but signs of consolidation are setting in. A $10 billion options expiry on May 30 has introduced near-term caution. Meanwhile, whales are reportedly redistributing holdings, and futures sentiment has cooled slightly. Institutional inflows remain healthy, with $432.7 million flowing into Bitcoin ETFs just days ago, but active traders are now looking to maximize upside elsewhere. Solana Hits Resistance While Growth Slows Solana continues to show strength with a rebound to the $175–$180 range , yet analysts are watching resistance levels at $200 and $210 . Despite Standard Chartered’s $275 target for year-end and the high-throughput promise of the upcoming Firedancer upgrade , memecoin volume on Solana is slowing, and capital rotation is beginning. For investors who’ve captured gains in BTC and SOL, the current environment is prompting a move into newer narratives and breakout charts . Dogecoin: Speculation Meets Structure Dogecoin is again commanding attention — but this time, it’s more than memes. Trading at $0.2257 , DOGE is consolidating just below key resistance at $0.24–$0.25 . Technical analysts are highlighting bullish breakout patterns , and active wallet addresses have doubled , showing real ecosystem engagement. If DOGE clears resistance, targets at $0.30 to $0.50 become plausible, especially if high-profile endorsements or social media catalysts emerge. Traders are watching closely, and some are already increasing their exposure. SEI: Quietly Building, Attracting Capital While SEI has stayed out of headlines, its Layer-1 DeFi infrastructure continues to expand.

2025-05-29T17:53:58.000Z,"HTX DAO and HTX Ventures at Bitcoin 2025: Empowering the Global Rise of the Bitcoin Ecosystem","BitcoinWorld HTX DAO and HTX Ventures at Bitcoin 2025: Empowering the Global Rise of the Bitcoin Ecosystem SINGAPORE, May 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — HTX DAO and HTX Ventures, two integral forces within the HTX ecosystem, proudly participated in Bitcoin 2025, the world’s premier Bitcoin summit held in Las Vegas. Engaging with global crypto leaders, they actively explored the future of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset industry—while supporting innovation and accelerating transformation across the decentralized ecosystem. Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX and Founder of TRON, joined a high-profile panel discussion during the event, where he shared invaluable insights on Bitcoin’s evolution, WBTC’s critical role in smart contract integration, and how U.S. policy signals are shaping worldwide adoption. “One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned since entering crypto in 2012 is: never bet against Bitcoin,” said Sun. “We’ve already seen Bitcoin surpass $110,000, and I firmly believe that as long as we keep building, Bitcoin will continue to hit new highs.” Reflecting on his recent engagement with U.S. President Donald Trump, Sun emphasized the significance of political support for the industry, “President Trump’s backing is monumental. Without his support, Bitcoin wouldn’t have broken $100,000. The U.S. plays a leading role in global financial regulation—once it sets a clear crypto policy, other countries will follow. This will speed up global Bitcoin adoption and bring more people into the crypto space.” Sun also spoke in depth about Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) as a gateway for unlocking Bitcoin’s potential in the smart contract world, “WBTC enables Bitcoin holders to interact with DeFi, earn yield, and use BTC as collateral across Ethereum, TRON, Solana and more. It transforms Bitcoin into a programmable asset. With proof-of-reserve, on-chain transparency, and cold storage security, WBTC is both safe and powerful.” Looking ahead, Sun forecasted that traditional financial products will inevitably migrate onto the blockchain, creating new opportunities for yield and arbitrage, “WBTC is just the first step. In the future, all financial products—stocks, bonds, stablecoins—will be brought on-chain. Transparency and decentralization will define the next generation of global finance.” Immersive Community Experience by HTX DAO and HTX Ventures During the event, HTX DAO and HTX Ventures unveiled a life-size replica of Justin Sun’s iconic space capsule, inviting attendees to participate in an immersive and shareable experience. Visitors were encouraged to follow @HTX_DAO and @Ventures_HTX on X (formerly Twitter), and post creative selfies using the hashtag #HTXDAOLasVegas. Winners received up to 100 USDT in crypto rewards.

2025-05-29T17:37:08.000Z,"Critical Statements from FED Member Goolsbee: “We Could Have Cut Interest Rates, But…”","Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Monday that the U.S. Federal Reserve could cut interest rates if large-scale tariffs can be avoided. Avoiding these tariffs through trade agreements or other means could pave the way for easing monetary policy, given the strong economic fundamentals and positive trend in inflation, according to Goolsbee. Speaking at the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference, Goolsbee likened the economic impact of tariffs to “a layer of fat on top of healthy abs,” adding, “If we can take that layer off, you've got a six-pack underneath.” Goolsbee’s statements came after the US Trade Court ruled to cancel many tariffs implemented during the Trump administration. It was stated that these tariffs carried the risk of driving up inflation and slowing economic growth. In particular, the practices that went into effect on April 2 and are known to the public as the “Liberation Day Tariffs” are among the developments that the FED is closely monitoring. Related News: Is the Bitcoin Rally Over or Continuing After Yesterday's Fed Minutes? Pay Close Attention Tomorrow Goolsbee said that the labor market was stable before that date and inflation was moving toward the Fed's 2% target. Under these conditions, he said, the policy rate, currently between 4.25% and 4.5%, could be lowered to an equilibrium level of around 3% in the long run. However, according to Goolsbee, the uncertainty about customs duties is currently causing companies to postpone their investments. “Companies are putting pens down until there is clarity on trade policy,” Goolsbee said, adding that the Fed is also expecting a similar outcome. Policymakers are concerned that customs duties will disrupt the decline in inflation and increase unemployment. Goolsbee also warned that if the court ruling creates prolonged uncertainty, it could have more negative effects. He added that the U.S. government could reimpose tariffs on imported goods for different reasons. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-29T17:26:26.000Z,"Crypto today: ZBCN and LIBRA skyrocket as markets retreat on Fed uncertainty","Bitcoin remains stuck below $110,000 as the financial landscape maintains a cautious tone following the latest Fed updates. While most tokens experienced bearish price actions as sellers outweighed buyers, Zebec Network (ZBCN) and LIBRA bucked the trend with double-digit gains. ZBCN and LIBRA saw sharp gains of 45% and 81% in the past day, respectively, as the latest Fed meeting minutes , released on May 28, highlighted concerns about economic slowdown, unemployment, and persistent inflation. ZBCN rallies after strategic acquisition Zebec Network stole the show today as its native token posted significant gains. The daily chart shows ZBCN rallied from the opening price of $0.00428 to a record peak of $0.006222. That represented a more than 45% jump, and happening amidst broad market declines, the upsurge grabbed the crypto community’s attention. What fueled Zebec Network’s rallies over the past 24 hours? ZBCN’s sharp uptrend emerged after reports that Zebec purchased UK-based fintech firm Science Card.

LIBRA spikes as Circle freezes founders’ wallets While fundamental catalysts drove ZBCN’s rally, LIBRA’s explosive gain followed crucial regulatory developments. As we reported earlier , a US court ordered Circle to lock two Solana addresses tied to LIBRA’s core team. The move is part of an investigation scrutinizing the Argentine President’s role in LIBRA’s debacle, which left users with massive losses. LIBRA trades at $0.02764, gradually erasing its latest gains. Chart by CoinMarketCap Nevertheless, it remains 11% up on its daily chart, with soaring trading volumes signaling renewed interest in the meme token. Crypto market retreats on Fed uncertainty Digital assets saw brief corrections over the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin sliding to $107,055 at press time. Cryptos reflect the downbeat outlook in the entire financial landscape. Tech-related stocks led the downside after the latest Fed minutes release. The report revealed concerns about employment fragility, persistent inflation, and economic slowdown. While the Fed maintained interest rates at 4.25% – 4.50%, the data suggested challenges for the US economy in the coming times. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated: Until we know more about how this is going to settle out and what the economic implications are for employment or for inflation, I couldn’t confidently say that I know what the appropriate path will be. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to set the market tone in the near term. With the prevailing uncertainty, all eyes remain on the key support zone at $106,800. Losing this barrier could trigger a surge in volatility, with $102,000 as the next target. However, a rebound and closing above $110,000 could catalyze short-term rallies to fresh all-time highs.

2025-05-29T17:24:08.000Z,"Is the Bitcoin Rally Over or Continuing After Yesterday’s Fed Minutes? Pay Close Attention Tomorrow","Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets experienced slight losses following the release of the minutes from the Fed's May 6-7 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The hawkish statements in the minutes limited investors' short-term risk appetite. Fed officials said that “tough policy choices” could be on the table due to the risks of persistent inflation and a looming recession. “Participants agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased and decided that a cautious approach would be appropriate until the clear economic impacts of changes in government policies become more apparent,” the minutes said. Despite this, BRN analysts said institutional demand remained strong. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have recorded net inflows for the 10th consecutive day, with BlackRock making the biggest contribution. BRN analyst Valentine Fournier noted that many companies have announced plans to add BTC to their portfolios as a reserve asset. Related News: BREAKING: Highly Anticipated Critical FED Meeting Minutes Released - Here Are All the Details “Bitcoin continues to benefit from its positioning as a hedge and long-term asset. Institutional adoption is strong and more firms are building BTC reserves,” BRN analysts said, noting that the rally could pick up speed again once profit-taking is over. Another important development that investors are focusing on is the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, the Fed's most important inflation indicator. The data, which will be released on Friday, is of critical importance for the markets. According to CoinPanel senior automation expert Dr. Kirill Kretov, a lower-than-expected data could increase the likelihood of a rate cut by the Fed, easing inflation concerns. However, he noted that higher data could trigger a risk-off mode. “The liquidity structure in crypto markets is still fragile, so we could see extreme price movements even if the data beats or falls short of expectations by just 0.1%,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-29T17:15:23.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Outlook: 3 Bullish and 2 Bearish Factors to Watch","TL;DR Bitcoin continues to show signs of strength, with indicators pointing toward sustained interest and potential for continued growth. While sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, similar conditions in the past have sometimes preceded sharp corrections, reminding investors to stay vigilant. The Bullish Elements Bitcoin (BTC) made history on May 22 by surging to nearly $112,000 – its highest level ever. Since then, it has pulled back to $108,600 (according to CoinGecko), but several factors suggest that there is still fuel left for further gains. Earlier today (May 29), the popular analyst Ali Martinez revealed that more than 30,000 BTC have been moved off exchanges in the last 30 days. Calculated in current rates, the stash equals over $3.2 billion. Such a development suggests that investors have shifted from centralized platforms to self-custody solutions, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. According to CryptoQuant’s data, the asset’s supply on exchanges currently stands at less than 2.45 million BTC, which is the lowest point observed since the summer of 2018. The following factor is the growing inflows toward the spot Bitcoin ETFs . Data compiled by SoSoValue shows that the last day with a negative daily netflow was May 13. Since then, the funds have attracted over $4.1 billion in the span of just a couple of weeks. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), for instance, has recorded 33 consecutive days of inflows, accumulating nearly $4 billion over the last two weeks. The investment vehicle now ranks among the top five ETFs (out of over 4,200 products) in terms of inflows for 2025. Last but not least, we’ll take a look at BTC’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. As the name suggests, it compares bitcoin’s market capitalization to its realized capitalization and helps traders identify whether the asset is undervalued or overvalued. Over the past month, the ratio has been hovering in the healthy zone of 2-2.50, indicating that there is still room for price growth. CryptoQuant claims that historically, values above 3.70 have indicated market tops, while figures below 1 have pointed out bottoms. BTC MVRV, Source: CryptoQuant Something for the Bears Contrary to the optimistic landscape, there are some concerns to consider. IntoTheBlock’s data shows that, as of the moment, no single BTC investor is sitting on paper losses , while a staggering 98% have made some profits (at least on paper) on their initial investments. BTC Investors in Profit, Source: ITB This might sound encouraging, but in the past, such trends were sometimes followed by a price pullback. In October 2024, about 95% of BTC holders were in profit as the asset’s valuation topped $69,000 before briefly falling below $65,500. A similar pattern was also seen in September and March last year. As reported earlier today, Santiment also believes that such high numbers of investors in profit could spell trouble for the asset as they tend to realize profits. We now move on to the popular Fear & Greed Index, whose ratio has been in either “Greed” or “Extreme Greed” territory since May 5. The metric examines various factors, including price fluctuations, survey responses, and social media activity, to assess the ongoing investor sentiment toward the cryptocurrency. BTC Fear and Greed, Source: alternative.me It appears that there is growing optimism and an increasing appetite for BTC, but let’s not forget that the crypto market is unpredictable, and price movements often defy the crowd’s expectations. One should also keep in mind Warren Buffett’s famous advice, who once said people should “be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.” The post Bitcoin Price Outlook: 3 Bullish and 2 Bearish Factors to Watch appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-outlook-3-bullish-and-2-bearish-factors-to-watch/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T17:13:17.000Z,"Kazakhstan to permit crypto payments in pilot mode","Kazakhstan intends to pilot cryptocurrency payments as part of a new policy of regulating rather than banning transactions with digital assets like Bitcoin. The news from the Central Asian nation, which has established itself as a crypto mining hub, comes amid government efforts to legalize crypto-related operations. Kazakhstan to permit crypto payments in pilot mode Authorities in Kazakhstan want to try payments with digital coins in a pilot zone called “CryptoCity,” the country’s head of state announced at a forum in the capital city Astana, which brought together political and business leaders with representatives of international organizations. The special venue will allow users to spend cryptocurrencies, said Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev who addressed participants in the event devoted to global challenges in areas such as trade and energy. Quoted by the Trend news agency and Tengrinews, he stated: “We plan to create an innovative pilot zone, CryptoCity, in which cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase goods, services and for other purposes.” Tokayev did not provide more details about the project, which is the latest in a string of crypto-friendly initiatives aimed at allowing Kazakhstan to better tap into the profits generated in its growing crypto market. The country became an attractive destination for Bitcoin miners after China’s decision to crack down on the industry and enforce a ban on crypto transactions in 2021. However, until recently, they had few legal options to exchange or spend their coins in the country. Cryptocurrencies could be traded only on platforms registered at the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC), which resulted in the spreading of illegal exchange and the transfer of around $15 billion worth of crypto assets out of the country, according to an estimate by the central bank. The government seems to have changed its strict regulatory approach lately, as evident in an article published by Kazakhstan’s Deputy Minister for Digital Development, Kanysh Tuleushin, earlier in May. In the op-ed, Tuleushin urged for the adoption of “flexible rules” for the crypto space and calculated this could bring Kazakhstan over $370 million in annual budget receipts, much more than the $35 million it received from miners in the past three years. Last week, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) announced it has drafted legislative changes to regulate the crypto market, including introducing a licensing regime for cryptocurrency exchanges operating across the country, not just in the AIFC hub. The monetary authority has been also pushing for a state-controlled trading platform. Astana to strengthen Kazakhstan’s potential in digital tech and AI In his speech at the Astana International Forum ( AIF ), Kassym-Jomart Tokayev touched on other priorities for his nation, including its aspiration to become a “Eurasian IT hub.” The president emphasized the country is investing in human capital and expanding opportunities for young professionals as it seeks to enlarge its middle class. He also highlighted Kazakhstan’s progress towards digital transformation and stated: “We pay special attention to artificial intelligence (AI). Our goal is to become an academic and innovation hub.” The AIF, held in Astana on May 29-30, is attended by government officials from a number of countries as well as current and former international figures such as the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Alain Berset, and the ex-Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon. This year, the organizers expanded their focus to cover a broader range of global issues such as energy security, climate action, geopolitical cooperation, international trade, technological innovation, and sustainable development, among which the crypto topic found its place, too. The forum’s main goal is to enhance collaboration and elaborate cross-sectoral approaches in all these areas.

2025-05-29T17:00:06.000Z,"Analysts Are Predicting XRP Price To Climb Above $20 In Unexpected Rally","XRP has continued to attract bullish attention despite the current uncertainty surrounding its price action , with its price now trading around the $2.30 level at the time of writing. Nonetheless, recent activity around XRP on social media points to the possibility of a move to double digits , as prominent analysts on X continue to signal that a major rally may be imminent. The sentiment is being amplified by both technical patterns and social media posts predicting an unstoppable surge to $20 and beyond. JackTheRippler’s No Warning Surge Forecast One of the loudest bullish voices at the moment is JackTheRippler, a well-followed analyst on X with nearly 390,000 followers. In his recent post on the platform , the analyst warned that XRP is going to pump without any warning. This is a remark that reflects the spontaneous nature of XRP’s previous major moves, especially considering the price action in Q4 2024 that sent the XRP price surging to multi-year peaks and just short of its 2018 all-time high of $3.40. Attached to his post is a chart showing a textbook Elliott Wave structure. According to the wave count, XRP has completed wave (i) and is currently completing a corrective wave (ii) structure. If the wave count holds, wave (iii) would be explosive, as it is the strongest wave in Elliott theory . According to his projection, the impulsive wave (iii) will push the XRP price towards $16 before another wave (iv) consolidation. Lastly, the projection shows that the final wave (v) will stretch XRP’s price into the $30+ range. Final XRP Wave Starting Now Adding further to the bullish outlook is another analysis shared by crypto trader STEPH. His chart offers a slightly different analysis from JackTheRippler but no less aggressive forecast. Unlike the wave-based projection from JackTheRippler, STEPH’s chart breaks down XRP’s rally into three distinct momentum phases labeled Pump 1, Pump 2, and the upcoming final pump. According to his weekly candlestick timeframe chart, XRP has already experienced two major bullish phases in the current cycle since July 2024. However, its price has spent the last 16 weeks or so in sideways consolidation, but this is seen to be a resting phase before a new leg up. STEPH’s chart illustrates this by showing XRP coiling just beneath the $3 mark inside a range that began in early 2025. Nonetheless, the analyst projected a final third pump, drawn in another red box, that suggests a rally that could take XRP directly into the $25 to $40 range. Both analysts present an interesting case for XRP’s bullish future, with price targets ranging from $20 to beyond $30 in the months ahead. It is important to note that while these technical setups show strong potential, confirmation is still necessary. A breakout above $3.40 with high volume would provide that confirmation and cause inflows of new capital into XRP. Until then, the cryptocurrency is in an accumulation phase. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.29, down by 0.3% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-climb-above-20/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Elliot Wave Structure|JackTheRipper|Steph|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T16:55:00.000Z,"JPMorgan Chase Fined $566,082 for Allegedly Failing To Respond to Regulator During Energy Crisis","France’s energy regulator is penalizing the German unit of global financial services firm JPMorgan Chase for failing to provide sufficient information to a power market survey related to soaring electricity prices. In a statement, the French Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) says it sought to question 44 market participants to understand the causes of the unprecedented increase in electricity prices, which spiked in 2022. The CRE says that 43 participants responded to requests for information, but J.P. Morgan SE (JPMSE) refused to share some information, particularly those related to the identity of the company’s counterparties and customers that engaged in transactions related to the subject of the survey. JPMSE reasoned that the French regulator does not have the power to make binding requests to market players based in other European Union member states. In response, the CRE says it conducted an investigation and found the firm violated a law that entitles the regulator to collect information from companies operating in the French electricity market. The CRE’s Disputes and Sanctions Settlement Committee (CoRDiS) is now sanctioning JMPSE with a €500,000 ($567,500) fine. “This is the first decision of the CoRDiS concerning a breach of the obligation to communicate information necessary for the fulfillment of the CRE’s missions.” At time of publishing, JPMorgan Chase has not issued a public comment addressing the fine.

While most altcoins have continued their rise since the mid-April market bottom, Shiba Inu has been sidelined in the “best crypto to buy” conversation, falling over 20% throughout May. Data from Santiment shows that the Shiba Inu supply on exchanges has increased from 139 trillion to $141 trillion over the past month in what appears to be a new uptrend. SHIB supply on exchanges through May. Source: Santiment. With fewer traders adopting a HODL strategy, the SHIB price may be subject to higher levels of volatility as more turn to short-term speculative trading. SHIB Price Analysis: What Do These Traders Know? This strategy shift comes amid a bearish flag pattern, developing since the mid-April market bottom—a potential brief pause before the bearish momentum continues. SHIB / USDT 1-week chart, bearish flag pattern. Source: TradingView / Binance. The month-long price decline has pushed a retest of the pattern’s lower support, a key level that could give way to a pattern breakdown. If breached, SHIB risks a 60% decline to the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $0.0000058, potentially wiping out all of its 2024 gains. Momentum indicators currently hang in the balance. The RSI trends sideways just below the neutral 50 mark at 46—sellers dominate, but not decisively. The MACD also widens its lead above the signal line after a recent golden cross, although only marginally, it supports the formation of a longer-term uptrend despite short-term bearishness. In the near term, the 0.618 Fib level at $0.000013 is a key support to watch. A strong bounce could send the SHIB price up 35%, back toward the flag’s upper resistance around $0.00002, invalidating the pattern if it breaks out above. Bullish Sentiment is Returning – Here’s How to Take Advantage Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin as a major part of their portfolio, especially as “safe-haven” assets like gold and BTC continue to outperform altcoins. But, while Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting highs of $1M this cycle and BTC finally back on the recovery path, $BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $6.5 million raised in its ongoing presale , the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially due to its 62% APY on staking that rewards early investors for holding. You can keep up with Bitcoin Bull on X and Telegram . To buy $BTCBULL and benefit from its rising momentum, visit the official Bitcoin Bull website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can invest using crypto or a bank card.

2025-05-29T16:41:49.000Z,"BTC fate tied to institutions but RUVI gains ground with investor-friendly bonuses","While Bitcoin (BTC) rides the institutional wave to sustain its growth, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is forging a different path by offering individual investors attractive bonuses during its presale. As the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market evolve, these two projects are exemplifying contrasting approaches to capturing investor interest. The institutional pillar of Bitcoin Bitcoin remains the flagship cryptocurrency and a gold standard for digital assets. Since its inception, it has grown from an experimental technology into a recognized store of value, often dubbed digital gold. Bitcoin pioneered decentralized ledger technology, creating a market that now boasts thousands of competing projects. However, Bitcoin’s reliance on institutional adoption has become more apparent in recent years. Corporate giants and financial institutions are playing a significant role in stabilizing its price and influencing its trajectory. Companies like Tesla and Strategy, as well as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, have bolstered interest. Still, Bitcoin’s future success leans heavily on institutional buy-in. Large-scale adoption by hedge funds, investment firms, and central banks is crucial to sustain confidence and momentum. While this dynamic appeals to some, it has also created skepticism among smaller investors wary of price manipulation and dependency on institutional actors. Ruvi AI: merging blockchain with artificial intelligence On the other end of the spectrum is Ruvi AI, a rising star blending blockchain and artificial intelligence to reshape industries. Unlike Bitcoin, which functions primarily as a decentralized currency and store of value, Ruvi AI is creating a platform for decentralized content generation. From text and images to audio and video, Ruvi AI empowers users to utilize advanced AI tools for creative and practical purposes. Its native token, $RUVI, serves as the backbone of its ecosystem, providing governance options, staking rewards, and access to premium features. Projects like Ruvi AI sidestep the dominance of institutions by focusing on real-world applications and grassroots development. This fresh approach is gaining traction, underscored by the project’s rapid progress since launch. Ruvi AI’s presale success Ruvi AI has become a talking point in the investor community due to its stellar presale performance. Phase 1 of the presale, priced at $0.010, closed within just two weeks, leaving many scrambling to join in Phase 2. With tokens now priced at $0.015, early participants have already enjoyed a 50% increase in investment value. The project has amassed over 1,400 holders, further demonstrating its broad appeal among retail investors. On top of this, Ruvi AI has achieved significant milestones, including securing its first exchange listing and forming a strategic partnership with a major trading platform. Upcoming announcements are expected to fuel further growth, making this a pivotal moment to join the Ruvi AI movement. Investor-friendly bonuses for maximum returns One of Ruvi AI’s standout features is its bonus structure for presale participants. Investors can maximize their returns with three tailored VIP tiers based on their level of commitment. Below, we break down the potential returns for each tier using projected token price increases. VIP 2 Threshold: 50,000 $RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token) Bonus: 40% (+20,000 tokens) Total Tokens: 70,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07): $4,900 Value at Predicted Price ($1): $70,000 VIP 3 Threshold: 100,000 $RUVI ($1,500 at $0.015/token) Bonus: 60% (+60,000 tokens) Total Tokens: 160,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07): $11,200 Value at Predicted Price ($1): $160,000 VIP 5 Threshold: 500,000 $RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015/token) Bonus: 100% (+500,000 tokens) Total Tokens: 1,000,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07): $70,000 Value at Predicted Price ($1): $1,000,000 For investors seeking exponential growth opportunities, Ruvi AI’s presale offers an accessible route to long-term rewards. A tale of two strategies Bitcoin’s institutional-driven growth is a testament to its maturity and market leadership. However, this reliance on large-scale players leaves little room for individual investors to influence its trajectory or access meaningful bonuses. The modest returns forecasted for Bitcoin pale in comparison to up-and-coming projects with smaller market caps and untapped potential. Ruvi AI’s focus on community empowerment and practical applications offers an exciting alternative. With affordable entry points, tailored bonus incentives, and a clear roadmap for adoption, it provides individual investors with a chance to participate in its ascent from the ground floor. Is Ruvi AI the better bet? While Bitcoin remains a solid investment for long-term believers in decentralized currencies, Ruvi AI caters to a broader audience by delivering value through innovation, practicality, and investor-friendly policies. For those seeking growth beyond Bitcoin’s institutional gatekeepers, Ruvi AI represents a compelling opportunity. The project’s current presale phase at $0.015 provides a unique chance to secure a position before prices climb further. Investors looking for maximum returns might find Ruvi AI’s grassroots model too promising to ignore. The choice is clear but the window to act is closing.

2025-05-29T16:39:54.000Z,"Saudi Prince: We Are Long-Term XRP Holders","In a powerful revelation that underscores the deepening global confidence in XRP, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud has publicly confirmed that his family has been a long-term holder of the digital asset. The news, highlighted by Vandell of Black Swan Capitalist on X, comes on the heels of a monumental $121 million investment led by the prince to transform VivoPower International PLC, a Nasdaq-listed company, into the world’s first XRP-focused digital asset firm. For years, Vandell and analyst Versan have referenced the Saudi royal family’s quiet interest in XRP, but this announcement marks the first time that connection has been confirmed so openly. The recent investment signals a pivotal moment not just for VivoPower but for XRP’s institutional trajectory on the global stage. Remember the Saudi royal family, Prince & XRP? Something Versan & I mentioned a few times for years. Well, Prince Abdulaziz led a $121M investment to transform VivoPower, a public company, into the first XRP-focused digital asset firm. They've officially announced their… — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) May 29, 2025 Transforming VivoPower Into an XRP Powerhouse The investment led by Prince Abdulaziz will establish a dedicated XRP-based digital asset treasury within VivoPower. This bold strategy positions the company as a trailblazer among publicly traded firms, mirroring the high-profile Bitcoin treasury model pioneered by Strategy, but with a focused bet on XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. In a formal statement, Prince Abdulaziz emphasized his family’s decade-long involvement in the digital asset space and, more specifically, their steadfast commitment to XRP. He explained that after assessing several public companies seeking to adopt a digital asset treasury model, VivoPower was chosen due to its targeted approach toward XRP and its clear mission to advance the XRPL ecosystem. A Decade of Royal Confidence in XRP Prince Abdulaziz’s remarks provide rare insight into the Saudi royal family’s investment philosophy regarding cryptocurrencies. While many global investors have focused on Bitcoin or Ethereum, the prince’s team has maintained a long-term XRP position, viewing the asset as uniquely positioned for real-world financial applications, particularly cross-border payments. This decade of quiet accumulation and strategic patience now aligns with VivoPower’s transformation, reinforcing the prince’s belief that the time is ripe to expand XRP’s global presence and leverage its network capabilities at scale. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Wave Builds Around XRP The prince’s backing of VivoPower reflects a growing institutional wave of interest in XRP that has gained momentum throughout 2025. Earlier this year, companies like Wellgistics Health announced plans to adopt XRP as part of their reserve asset strategies, while firms such as Worksport have explored similar moves. With Prince Abdulaziz’s formal involvement, the signal to global markets is clear: XRP is increasingly seen not just as a speculative token but as an institutional-grade asset with tangible utility. This high-profile endorsement from a Saudi royal amplifies XRP’s credibility in global finance circles, particularly in the Middle East, where sovereign wealth and state-backed capital could further accelerate adoption. XRP’s Future Shines Bright As XRP’s institutional story unfolds, Prince Abdulaziz’s bold statement reinforces the digital asset’s staying power and potential. The prince’s vision to use VivoPower as a vehicle to expand the XRPL ecosystem underscores the maturing landscape of blockchain finance and the pivotal role XRP aims to play in it. With royal backing, strategic alignment, and growing institutional conviction, XRP is poised to continue its evolution from a cross-border payments solution to a core building block in the next generation of financial infrastructure. As Vandell from Black Swan Capitalist rightly noted, the Saudi royal connection is no longer just speculation; it’s now front and center, marking a defining moment in XRP’s global journey.

2025-05-29T16:39:23.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Russia’s Banks Ignite Bitcoin Adoption","Russia’s central bank just flipped the regulatory script, granting a green light for licensed banks to package crypto-based instruments exclusively for accredited investors. This move marks a significant thaw in Moscow’s stance, and is the extension of a previous proposal that involved wealthy individuals being allowed to invest in crypto . By allowing derivatives, securities and other digital financial assets tied to Bitcoin under a legal umbrella, the Bank of Russia is setting a precedent that could ripple across global markets. As accredited clients gain carbon‑copy access to crypto exposure without wrestling with wallets or exchanges, savvy traders are already eyeing the shifting landscape. For investors scouting opportunity, this latest development underscores why it’s time to pinpoint the best crypto to buy now. The Ruble Route to Bitcoin: How Russia Is Reinventing Crypto Access Russian regulators have quietly handed banks the keys to a fresh suite of crypto products for accredited investors, while emphatically barring any outright delivery of tokens. On May 28, the Bank of Russia confirmed that qualified institutions can now launch derivatives, securities and other digital financial assets pegged to crypto prices, but not handle actual coin transfers. At the same time, public data revealed a 51% surge in resident crypto inflows during Q1 2025—an eye‑popping 7.3 trillion rubles ($81.5 billion). On the heels of the policy shift, T‑Bank (formerly Tinkoff) wasted no time, rolling out its own Bitcoin‑linked \""smart assets\"" through the state‑backed Atomyze platform on May 29. Users can now play the market in rubles via a familiar app interface—no exchange account or wallet management needed. True, the central bank still advises against direct crypto ownership. Yet discussions are underway for an experimental regime to let certain investors trade assets like Bitcoin outright. The latest financial stability review pegs Russians’ centralized exchange holdings at 827 billion rubles ($9.2 billion), with Bitcoin commanding a 62% share, Ether at 22% and stablecoins like USDT and USDC at roughly 16%. On the flip side, industry insiders argue that this figure barely scratches the surface—some believe actual holdings on personal wallets and decentralized venues run far higher, a claim underlined by Exved founder Sergey Mendeleev’s cheeky nod to hefty private balances. Best Crypto To Buy Now With banks primed to offer regulated crypto exposure and a dramatic uptick in inflows, the institutional undercurrent is shifting in favor of established and emerging tokens alike. As the search for the best crypto to buy now intensifies, and regulations loosen while new products hit the market, investors would do well to zero in on momentum leaders. BTC Bull Riding the wave of bank‑sponsored exposure, BTC Bull token amplifies Bitcoin’s gains with builtin leverage. It’s tailor‑made for traders seeking turbocharged returns as traditional institutions warm up to crypto. The $BTCBULL token captures Bitcoin's upside while rewarding holders with real BTC at price milestones. It's more than hype; structured mechanics offer multiple paths for potential returns alongside excitement. Simply holding $BTCBULL in the project's Best Wallet qualifies users for BTC airdrops. Rewards trigger at Bitcoin's first new high ($150k) and every $50k climb thereafter, creating recurring incentives. Bitcoin trades above its 2025 peak, yet institutional money keeps flowing in steadily. The floodgates are opening, signaling sustained interest even at elevated price levels. At $125K BTC, BTCBULL will trigger its first token burn. 🔥Less supply. Same hype. The charge is on! 🐂 pic.twitter.com/O218IzuwsE — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 27, 2025 $BTCBULL combines passive Bitcoin rewards with a deflationary token model. It targets investors seeking leveraged Bitcoin exposure plus altcoin growth potential within one asset.

The stakes? If Solana’s rally continues, Solaxy could become essential. Its success hinges on solving congestion just as Solana approaches its breaking point. According to popular crypto YouTuber 99Bitcoins , Solaxy has massive potential to deliver parabolic returns. Snorter Snorter’s dynamic yield strategy and community‑driven governance make it the dark horse in a regulated landscape. Think of it as the maverick that flips market conventions on their head.

It’s like a digital bloodhound, sniffing out value fast. Bitcoin Bitcoin, the blue-chip backbone of any crypto portfolio, remains the undisputed pioneer of digital assets.Now backed by bank-certified instruments, its dominance has never been more firmly endorsed by institutions worldwide. Often called “digital gold,” the asset introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto continues to make headlines—not just for breaking price resistance, but for reshaping global financial strategies. One such shift came as Pakistan launched its first government-backed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a major leap into the world of digital finance. The announcement was made by Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, during his keynote at Bitcoin Vegas 2025 in Las Vegas. Addressing a high-profile audience that included the U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump, and Donald Trump Jr., Saqib positioned Bitcoin as a path to financial freedom. He emphasized Pakistan’s intent to emerge as a serious player in the global crypto space, using blockchain to drive innovation and economic resilience. JD Vance echoed this optimism, urging the U.S. to lead the digital currency race, especially as China remains cautious on Bitcoin.He predicted Bitcoin would hold strategic value in U.S. policy for the next decade. In technical terms, it is currently trading at around $108,601 with a market cap of $2.15 trillion, positioning it in 1st place. However, over the past 24 hours, it has been declining, creating an opportunity for potential buyers to benefit from the dip. Meanwhile, Trump Media unveiled a $2.5 billion plan to build a Bitcoin treasury, placing cryptocurrency at the heart of its financial future. Conclusion This landmark decision by the Bank of Russia doesn’t just tweak rules—it accelerates crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. By opening the door for banks to tailor crypto instruments, regulators have signaled a broader trend toward institutional embrace and regulatory maturation. For accredited investors, it translates to safer entry points and diverse exposure methods. Looking ahead, this evolution could set a template for other markets while nudging token innovation into overdrive. As ever, measured strategy trumps blind speculation—focus on quality projects with robust fundamentals. After all, when the stakes are high, one wants the best crypto to buy now.

2025-05-29T16:30:31.000Z,"$400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’","Bitcoin has been trading in a tight band lately. Over the last 24 hours it dipped a bit, but it still sits between $108,000 and $110,000. According to market data, that range has held firm even as volatility showed up back in January and April. Related Reading: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO Lagging Money Supply Signal According to analyst Kyle Chassé, Bitcoin’s price tends to follow global M2 money supply with a 90-day lag. He matched daily closes on the Bitstamp exchange against world M2 data shifted three months back. That overlay shows that when global liquidity climbs, Bitcoin often rises after roughly 90 days. Short-Term Price Moves Bitcoin first spiked above $109,000 this past January. Then it fell below $75,000 in early April. Since that dip, it’s climbed back toward the $110,000 mark. Based on the lagged money-supply trend, it feels like a pause in a bigger up-and-down cycle rather than the end of a rally. Growing Money Figures Global M2 stood at about $98 trillion in early 2023. It rose to just over $108 trillion by early 2024. Then growth slowed, and Bitcoin spent some time below $80,000. Lately, M2 is past $111 trillion. Based on those numbers, reports say Bitcoin’s upside could stretch into mid-2025 as liquidity stays strong. Bitcoin is coded to $400K. pic.twitter.com/6BbogYw1UX — Kyle Chassé / DD🐸 (@kyle_chasse) May 27, 2025 Bullish Price Targets Chassé projects Bitcoin may hit $400,000 if global M2 keeps growing. It is “coded“, he says. That means roughly a 270% jump from the current $108,000 level. Based on this model, investors watching liquidity trends might see big gains, though it won’t be smooth. Other experts point out that money supply isn’t the only driver. Real interest rates, policy shifts and on-chain signals can speed up or slow down moves. If central banks turn hawkish, for example, higher rates could undercut Bitcoin even if M2 ticks up. Related Reading: $10 Million Fix? SUI Network Moves Fast After Cetus Exploit Scare What Comes Next Based on reports from Global Macro Investor, global M2 leads Bitcoin by about 12 weeks. That gives traders a rough timetable. If M2 growth really slows in coming months, Bitcoin may hold its ground or correct first. On the flip side, any fresh liquidity surge could set the stage for new highs. In the end, the link between money supply and Bitcoin price is a useful guide. It won’t tell you exactly when to buy or sell. But for anyone tracking big-picture trends, knowing that cash growth can flow into crypto after a three-month delay could help time decisions better.

Per the press release, Irdeto provides Coinbase with comprehensive investigative reports to help them identify and remove bad actors. “This disrupts the criminals’ ability to receive payments for illegal services and halts their progression into more serious forms of cybercrime,” it argues.

Additionally, the Cyber Services team also supports clients in reporting illegal activities and bad actors to law enforcement. This way, they help identify the crypto address owners, advance investigations, find and arrest offenders, build prosecution cases, and support the seizure and recovery of illicit crypto assets. The partnership “empowering us to remove financial lifelines from pirates and cheat developers before they can scale their operations,” said Mark Mulready, Vice President of Cyber Services at Irdeto. “This is a powerful example of how strategic industry collaboration can disrupt criminal infrastructure and protect the digital ecosystem.” You may also like: $200M Crypto Seized as DOJ Nabs 270 Suspects in Record Darknet Takedown On May 22, the DOJ cracked the dark web's code. 270 suspects were arrested—$200M in crypto and cash seized, as authorities delivered a crushing blow to the darknet’s economy.The operation, dubbed SpecTor, marks the largest darknet takedown ever, spanning nine countries and exposing crypto’s role as both a weapon and a weak spot for criminals.https://twitter.com/DOJCrimDiv/status/1925584597875621916Why Crypto Anonymity Isn’t as Untouchable as Criminals ThinkAttorney... Cutting Cybercrime Infra at Source Irdeto’s investigations found that threat actors across the video entertainment and gaming ecosystems utilize crypto increasingly for illegal activities. The team has shared what it’s described as “a concerning trend.” Namely, the use of crypto by illicit service providers jumped from 13% in 2022 to 17% in 2023, and then to 19% by the end of 2024. Therefore, the new partnership aims to disrupt cybercriminal infrastructure at the source, it says. Irdeto is “committed to not only detecting threats but actively dismantling the infrastructure that supports them,” added Mulready. The company will also continue working closely with digital transaction providers and law enforcement agencies globally. He added that partnerships, like the one with Coinbase, enhance the Payment Disruption service, thus helping to combat cybercrime across industries. Therefore, it’s actively signing more partnerships with crypto platforms. This will boost its ability to track crypto usage in illicit markets and remove critical financial enablers. \""The ultimate vision for crypto has always been economic freedom.\"" – @brian_armstrong , co-founder of @coinbase \""The mission of Coinbase is to increase economic freedom in the world.

A few days later, the US Justice Department (DOJ) opened an investigation into the security breach. In response to the incident, Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal stated that “we have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors.” On 25 May, investors filed a class action lawsuit , alleging that the exchange failed to promptly disclose a serious data breach and a regulatory violation, and that these contributed to a drop in stock price.

2025-05-29T16:17:28.000Z,"Bitcoin DeFi Explodes: Bull Run Locks 2,000 BTC – Is $115K Next?","Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on a bullish trajectory. The cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 before quickly retracting to $110,700. The price of BTC is currently hovering around $108,000, yet metrics suggest that Bitcoin is on an upward trend. Bitcoin bulls predict that the price of BTC may soon rally to $115,000. Bitcoin just hit new All time high of $111,700 and $BTC balance on exchanges hit new all time low. Supply shock is coming and that will send Bitcoin to $200k+ sooner than you think. pic.twitter.com/b9nEiXMUln — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 22, 2025 Bull Run Advances Bitcoin DeFi While investors eagerly await another BTC all-time high, industry experts point out that this bull run is different from previous cycles. Rena Shah, chief operating officer of Trust Machines, told Cryptonews that the recent Bitcoin all-time high has a different momentum compared to the first time BTC went above $100k. According to Shah, the current Bitcoin bull run is advancing Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) in new ways. For instance, Shah noted that a considerable amount of BTC has recently been locked into sBTC , a 1:1 bitcoin-backed asset secured via the Stacks blockchain. “The Bitcoin ecosystem has seen more and more BTC bridged, with more than 2,000 BTC recently being locked in Stacks sBTC ,” Shah said. “As more users look at the earning opportunities available without selling their Bitcoin, we’ll see a positive surge of building on Bitcoin follow.” sBTC Cap-3 officially filled in just a few hours, with over 5,000 BTC now made productive on the leading Bitcoin L2, Stacks. That’s over $500M in Bitcoin put to work. Stacks' momentum keeps rising. pic.twitter.com/ZyhrDa0p8f — stacks.btc (@Stacks) May 22, 2025 Echoing this, Matt Mudano, co-founder and CEO of Arch Network, told Cryptonews that Bitcoin is no longer just being held by investors. “In past cycles, the price of BTC surged primarily from speculation and accumulation. But this time, we’re seeing infrastructure mature to actually make Bitcoin productive,” he said. Mudano attributes this to the rise of Bitcoin layer-2 (L2) networks , along with native smart contract layers such as Arch. He further noted that BTC-backed stablecoins continue to unlock new use cases like lending, structured products, and DeFi built around Bitcoin. “That’s why we’re seeing more BTC bridged, wrapped, or integrated—not because people want to leave Bitcoin, but because they want to do more with it,” Mudano said. “The $100K narrative isn’t just about scarcity anymore—it’s about utility.” Bitcoin Becomes Active Capital New use cases demonstrate how Bitcoin is evolving from a passive store-of-value to a form of active capital in the digital economy. Mudano pointed out that previously, the only way for users to earn on BTC was to borrow against it or wrap it into Ethereum-based systems. However, these models come with risks such as liquidations, custodial exposure, or exiting from the Bitcoin trust model. In order to combat these challenges, Mudano explained that Arch allows users to earn yield without selling or borrowing against their BTC. This is accomplished by lending out BTC to protocols that deploy the asset into low-risk structured products or credit strategies. “Users can provide liquidity to Bitcoin-native decentralized exchanges and perp markets to earn fees from real economic activity,” he said. “Yield is now driven by actual demand, or the need to use BTC as capital in an on-chain economy, just like ETH became valuable by underpinning DeFi.” Just like Ethereum’s yield came from being the base layer of on-chain finance, Mudano believes that Bitcoin is finally entering that same phase, making this cycle vastly different from other bull runs. Shah agrees that Bitcoin is an asset that should be used as collateral. She explained that sBTC unlocks Bitcoin DeFi by allowing users to earn yield, access on-chain lending, and trade on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) . For example, protocols like Granite create the opportunity to lend and borrow against Bitcoin without ever having to sell. Launched in September 2024, Granite was incubated by Trust Machines and lets users access DeFi by leveraging Stacks’ recently launched Nakamoto upgrade and sBTC Bitcoin bridge . Willem Schroe, founder of Bitcoin L2 Botanix, told Cryptonews that Botanix also allows BTC holders to earn without selling their Bitcoin. Schroe believes this trend is gaining momentum in the current bull market. “This cycle, we’re seeing these use cases go from experimental to real. Live on testnet and soon to launch mainnet in mid-June, we’re already seeing users use pUSD, borrow against BTC, and engage with early DeFi protocols building on top of us,” Schroe commented. Palladium Labs bridges Bitcoin’s unmatched security with the flexibility of Web3 by introducing PUSD—a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin that operates without centralized control. @PalladiumLabs pic.twitter.com/U5Ckg9DTIW — Miki.base.eth (@Stanos126) May 29, 2025 To put this in perspective, Schroe explained that Botanix users can borrow against their BTC. The process involves locking up the asset and then minting a stablecoin like Palladium pUSD ( pUSD ) on Botanix. This provides liquidity without triggering a taxable event or exiting your position. Building on Bitcoin Surges Not only are more people across ecosystems getting interested in using Bitcoin for DeFi, but Bitcoiners who’ve long held their BTC dormant are getting involved in various innovations. “Momentum always follows capital—and for the first time, we have both flowing into Bitcoin. Past bull runs made people rich off Bitcoin. This one is about building with Bitcoin,” Mudano said. According to Mudano, several factors are currently converging that allow Bitcoin holders to do more this cycle. “Ordinals and Runes activity brought a wave of developer interest, but new infrastructure like Arch, Stacks, and others are making Bitcoin programmable without compromising its principles,” he said. At the same time, Mudano noted that capital markets are finally paying attention to digital assets. “ETFs, institutional strategies, and the realization that BTC can underpin a real financial system is all being seen now,” he said. Mudano further believes that while the current bull market may pump the price of BTC, the infrastructure wave is turning the narrative into a builder’s cycle. Shah agrees, as she pointed out that Stacks recently announced an entirely new roadmap, along with the launch of SIP-031 . Both of these developments demonstrate a more robust and competitive ecosystem around building on Bitcoin. Challenges To Consider While it’s clear that the current bull run is advancing Bitcoin DeFi, a number of challenges remain. For example, Mudano believes that the biggest factor holding back Bitcoin DeFi today is also what makes Bitcoin so powerful—its decentralization. “There’s no foundation, no core team, no steering committee to dictate how the chain should evolve,” he said. “That means there’s no single roadmap to scaling or programmability. Instead, it’s up to builders—independent teams like ours—to experiment, innovate, and push the boundaries of what’s possible within Bitcoin’s constraints.” Mudano added that the Bitcoin ecosystem is currently witnessing a wave of experimentation, ranging from covenants, to ZK-rollups , to threshold multisig and custom virtual machines. Schroe further noted that a lack of native programmability may hold Bitcoin DeFi back. “Bitcoin wasn’t designed for complex smart contracts,” he said. “Bitcoin-based blockchains like Botanix solve this by introducing Ethereum virtual machine compatibility while still anchoring to Bitcoin for settlement.” In addition, skepticism from Bitcoin purists has also created challenges. Schroe pointed out that these people often doubt the security and other aspects associated with Bitcoin DeFi. “Ultimately, the antidote is education and execution. The more users see how they can earn from BTC in a non-custodial, Bitcoin-native way, the faster adoption will follow,” he commented.

2025-05-29T16:14:29.000Z,"Real estate platform StegX to tokenize $100m of RWA on Hedera","Hedera’s traction in the real-world assets market is set for a major boost, thanks to $100 million worth of real-world assets coming on-chain via institutional real estate platform StegX. The Hedera Foundation, which supports the development of the Hedera ( HBAR ) blockchain network, revealed the huge news on May 29, 2025, noting in a blog post that its partnership with StegX will see the real estate platform deploy more than $100 million in real estate tokens on Hedera. The partnership also involves Zoniqx, a Silicon Valley-based firm focused on bridging real-world assets to the decentralized finance ecosystem via compliant and interoperable blockchain infrastructure. Zoniqx’s Dynamic Compliant Interoperable Security Token, or DyCIST, is the standard for ERC-7518 aimed at institutional tokenization. Zoniqx’s standard allows for the embedding of jurisdiction-aware compliance at the token layer, as well as the automation of know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering enforcement. KYC and AML are key compliance requirements that have slowed institutional entry into the tokenized real-world asset market. You might also like: Solv launches RWA-backed Bitcoin yield product StegX’s deployment of the tokens will leverage the security token standard ERC-7518, with this allowing the platform to tokenize regulated assets. Hedera Foundation said the platform’s move is one that “shifts tokenization from theory to execution.” “By integrating the ERC-7518 token standard on the Hedera network, the StegX marketplace is not only pioneering a new era of asset tokenization but also ensuring that every transaction is executed according to the regulations of the issuers,” said Daniel Radwansky, chief executive officer and co-founder of StegX. “Our partnership with Zoniqx fortifies this vision, providing a fully digital and compliant pathway for institutional investors to access premium tokenized real-world assets,” Radwansky added. The Hedera Foundation’s collaboration with StegX and Zoniqx comes just a day after Verra, a global carbon standard leader with over 1 billion carbon credits issued, integrated with Hedera. Verra accounts for over 60% of the global carbon credits market. The HBAR Foundation also recently partnered with asset tokenization platform Tokeny as it looks to bring compliant real-world asset tokenization to the Hedera network. In February, the HBAR Foundation invested in Fidelity International’s money market fund, with the shares tokenized by Archax.

2025-05-29T16:12:38.000Z,"Three reasons why the soaring SPX crypto token could crash soon","The SPX6900 token has been in a strong uptrend since March, making it one of the top gainers in crypto. SPX6900 ( SPX ) price jumped to a high of $1.222 on May 29, the highest point since January. It has soared by almost 350% from its March low, bringing its valuation to over $1 billion. It is now the eighth-largest meme coin in the crypto industry. SPX6900 has surged due to fear of missing out among investors, driving its total number of holders to 40,000 from 29,000 on January 1. This FOMO is also reflected in the rising number of social media mentions. While SPX has flipped the key resistance level at $1, there are several fundamental and technical reasons why it may crash in the coming days or weeks. First, Santiment data shows that the supply of SPX tokens on exchanges has continued to rise this month. There are now 87 million tokens on exchanges, up from the January low of 41 million. Nansen reports the exchange supply at 141 million, a 6.5% monthly increase.

Holders with between 1 million and 10 million tokens now hold 300 million SPX6900 coins, down from 330 million last month. Similarly, those holding between 100 million and 1 billion tokens have reduced their holdings to 148 million from April’s 163 million. SPX whale transactions | Source: Santiment Additional Nansen data shows that smart money investors now hold 4.6 million SPX coins, a 10% monthly decline. Their holdings have dropped to a record low, indicating that they expect further downside. SPX price technical analysis SPX6900 price chart | Source: crypto.news A final technical reason SPX may decline is the formation of a rising wedge pattern on the 12-hour chart. The lower trendline connects the lowest swings since May 7, while the upper trendline links the highest swings since April 14. These two lines are now nearing a confluence point, which could result in a strong bearish breakdown in the coming days. If that occurs, the first support level to watch is $1.00, followed by $0.6383, the lowest swing on May 18.

Nigel Farage is betting big on crypto. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, the Reform UK leader will announce a bold legislative proposal to make Britain a “crypto powerhouse” — a move aimed squarely at younger voters and digital asset enthusiasts, according to Bloomberg reporting . The bill, which Farage says is ready to be introduced if his party wins power, includes slashing capital gains tax on crypto investments from 24% to 10%, creating a two-year regulatory sandbox for crypto firms in the City of London, and banning financial discrimination against crypto users. Reform says this is the first fully drafted bill it has released, signaling the party’s intent to broaden its policy credentials ahead of the next general election. You might also like: Solana compresses near resistance, breakout to $241 likely if confirmed Following Donald Trump’s lead? Farage’s initiative mirrors U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent pro-crypto pivot . Trump has embraced digital assets to energize younger voters, with his son Eric recently declaring support for Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a way to disrupt the traditional banking system. Farage, a longtime ally of Trump, appears to be following the same playbook — framing crypto as a form of financial self-sovereignty and rebellion against central control. Farage’s crypto past includes promoting digital assets through a now-defunct investment newsletter, and he’s been vocal in opposing central bank digital currencies like the Bank of England’s proposed “Britcoin.” He calls Bitcoin a “peaceful revolt” against inflation and surveillance, per Bloomberg. Labour leader Keir Starmer criticized the move Thursday, likening Farage’s platform to the failed economic policies of Liz Truss. Still, Reform UK is gaining traction in the polls and outperformed Labour in recent local elections. The party will present the full bill to journalists Friday morning in London, marking its most serious policy rollout yet.

A young Russian couple involved in crypto was kidnapped by Chechens and forced to pay $43,000 in crypto as ransom, Argentine media reported on Thursday, May 28. The couple, who were running a crypto business, was kidnapped on Friday in the Palermo district of Buenos Aires. According to investigators, the couple was invited to a dinner by two Chechens. Around 11 PM local time, the 30-year-old woman was calling for help from the balcony. After that, employees at a nearby restaurant called the police, who soon arrived at the scene. At the scene, the police found the woman and her 27-year-old partner, who was tied up. The couple recounted that the Checkens made them send $43,000 in crypto to an associate’s wallet address before fleeing the scene. The police confirmed that the suspects fled the country to the United Arab Emirates.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

SOL/ETH weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April. Daily fees peaked in Q1 2025 but have since fallen to near-yearly lows, signaling reduced speculative activity on the chain, according to Dune Analytics.Pump.Fun fee and revenue chart. Source: Dune AnalyticsThe platform had been a major contributor to Solana's revenue growth, especially between December 2024 and March 2025. During this period, total cumulative fees surged past 3 million SOL as retail traders flooded the network to launch and trade meme tokens. These metrics have crashed ever since, weakening one of Solana's primary value drivers.A May 27 report from Standard Chartered further reinforces the downside narrative. The bank warned that Solana may underperform if it cannot diversify beyond memecoins, which currently dominate its transaction activity. Solana's decentralized exchange volume.

The retail CBDC pilot is being conducted with select customers and merchants through participating banks, while the wholesale pilot is targeting use in the interbank market.Per the report, the retail pilot has reached 600,000 users across 17 banks. To further scale adoption, the RBI has allowed “certain non-banks [...] to offer CBDC wallets.”The wholesale pilot has also seen increased institutional interest.

New features include “Magic Nodes,” which uncover hidden wallet connections among tokenholders, and “Time Travel,” a tool that reconstructs the historical distribution of tokens, potentially detecting early insider activity or coordinated accumulation efforts.“Historical data in crypto is notoriously hard to access because it gets buried under endless new transactions,” Bubblemaps CEO Nicolas Vaiman told Cointelegraph.“Time Travel changes that. It’s like watching a Big Bang, from the initial burst of a single bubble to a full-grown distribution,” he said.Source: BubblemapsThe tool allows users to rewind the token’s entire life cycle and evolving distribution structure, which will help them spot “early signs of manipulation or coordinated dumps,” Vaiman added.Related: Sui validators vote on $162M Cetus recovery plan to restore user fundsSpotting tokens with a large portion of the supply concentrated across a few wallets can help investors detect scams such as rug pulls, where insiders remove liquidity or stage a mass sell-off, resulting in a steep price collapse that leaves investors with worthless tokens.A large-scale rug pull hit the crypto industry on March 16 after the sudden collapse of the Wolf of Wall Street-inspired WOLF token, created by Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) and the Libra token.Source: BubblemapsThe memecoin saw a 99% crash, wiping out most of its peak $42 million market capitalization within a few hours.

DeFi Dev expects the adoption of this technology to “enhance the company’s validator operations and treasury management, consistent with its mission to maximize SOL Per Share” growth. Chief investment officer and chief operating officer Parker White said:The adoption of dfdvSOL not only creates additional ways to drive stake to our validators and increase SOL holdings, but also advances our role as a long-term participant in the Solana ecosystem.”Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard CharteredSol Strategies prepares to safeguard capitalSol Strategies also announced on May 28 that it had completed several key audits and certifications. The company passed SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1 audits and received ISO 27001 certification for its Solana staking platform.  SOC 2 Type 1 is a report assessing a company’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy at a specific point in time. Such an audit verifies that the firm’s controls meet trust service criteria at the time of the check.SOC 1 Type 1 is a similar report focused on internal controls over financial reporting at a specific point in time. This audit evaluates whether the controls are appropriately designed, but does not assess their effectiveness over time.Lastly, ISO 27001 is an international standard specifying requirements for an information security management system. These standards help manage risks pertaining to data confidentiality, integrity and availability through a continuous improvement framework.To obtain this ISO certificate, a company must demonstrate both the documentation and implementation of controls. Sol Strategies’ Wald explained that all these measures are meant to ensure institutional trust:“By achieving SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1, alongside our ISO 27001 certification, we’ve demonstrated that institutional clients can trust SOL Strategies with their Solana staking needs.”The compliance efforts come as the firm continues to position itself as a major Solana validator.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling.

Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share. Ethereum no longer ranks among the top ten protocols in terms of fees, creating a supply imbalance that contributes to inflationary pressure on ETH.Sell (put) options ill-prepared for ETH prices above $2,600ETH options aggregate open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $2,300 and $2,500: $420 million in calls (buy) vs. $220 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $200 million.Between $2,500 and $2,600: $500 million calls vs. $130 million puts, favoring calls by $370 million.Between $2,600 and $2,700: $590 million calls vs. $35 million puts, favoring calls by $555 million.Between $2,700 and $2,900: $780 million calls vs. $10 million puts, favoring calls by $770 million.Bulls are strongly incentivized to push ETH past $2,700, yet the broader context may override those efforts. Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Blockchain security firm Dedaub released a post-mortem report dissecting the incident details. According to the report, the hack was caused by an exploit of the liquidity parameters used by the Cetus automated market maker (AMM).The hackers manipulated the field by altering values that went undetected in a most significant bits (MSB) check. Changes to a binary code’s most significant bits dramatically alter the values produced by that binary code.This allowed the hackers to add massive amounts of liquidity to the system with only a keystroke and drain other liquidity pools of hundreds of millions of dollars.Magazine: Weird ‘null address’ iVest hack, millions of PCs still vulnerable to ‘Sinkclose’ malware: Crypto-Sec",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cork-protocol-hacked-contracts-paused?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
