2025-05-28T21:49:03.000Z,"JD Vance Blasts Gary Gensler at Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Promises Full Cryptocurrency Deregulation","U.S. Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the Trump administration’s deregulatory stance toward the crypto sector in remarks at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. JD Vance Slams Gary Gensler In Fiery Remarks During his speech, Vance reaffirmed the administration’s opposition to former United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to cryptocurrencies . Vice President JD Vance Delivers Remarks at Bitcoin 2025 Conference at Las Vegas, NV https://t.co/m2IIVUS1j4 — Vice President JD Vance (@VP) May 28, 2025 “We reject regulators,” Vance said . “We fired Gary Gensler, and we’re going to fire everybody like him.” The former Senator from Ohio further claimed that the Trump administration is committed to cleaning up the “wreckage” from former U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, which saw extensive guardrails placed on the blockchain sector . “We prioritize eliminating the rules, the red tape, and the lawfare that we saw aimed at our crypto by our predecessors,” Vance said. “We’re ending the weaponization of federal regulations against this community. To put it simply, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is dead, and it is not coming back under the Trump administration.” “With President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House,” he added. Trump’s Crypto Ties Face Scrutiny Vance’s comments come just days after Trump hosted an exclusive dinner for the top 220 investors of his namesake memecoin at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C. Critics of the event argue that the gala may have violated key presidential ethics provisions, citing concerns over potential foreign influences’ ability to purchase the cryptocurrency. In a May 14 letter, three key Democratic members of the House of Representatives urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to unseal suspicious activity reports (SARs) into “politically oriented” Trump-affiliated ventures. “Because the identities of the coin purchasers need not be publicly disclosed, there is no way to tell who is buying the coin, potentially allowing bad actors, including authoritarian governments and companies they control, to enrich the Trump family,” the House members said of $TRUMP. The U.S. lawmakers have asked the requested SARs to be returned by May 30, though it remains unclear how Bessent will proceed.

2025-05-28T21:43:04.000Z,"Trump Coin Price Prediction: $100 Incoming or Full Collapse? The $3B Mystery Gets Deeper","Official Trump ($TRUMP) coin holders are on edge after Trump Media & Technology Group—the entity responsible for former U.S. President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform—denied a Financial Times report alleging plans to raise $3 billion through a combination of equity and convertible bonds for investing in Bitcoin and other cryptos. The report, published earlier this week, cites six anonymous sources familiar with the situation. The company’s response was blunt: “Apparently, the Financial Times employs clueless writers who rely on even less credible sources.” The media firm reportedly planned to raise $2 billion through equity offerings and $1 billion via convertible bonds—securities that it can later exchange for company stock. The FT also noted that the size of the capital raise remained flexible and adjustable. Impact on Official Trump Coin Price Over the past 24 hours, the Official Trump meme coin has slipped 2.2% to $12.74 — mirroring broader weakness across the crypto market, with Bitcoin down 1.7% and the total market cap retreating 3.2% to $3.54 trillion. Yet zooming out paints a more dramatic picture: since last Wednesday, TRUMP has tumbled 14%, sharply underperforming rivals like Dogecoin (down 2.5%) and even Bitcoin, which managed to climb 1% over the same period. This divergence raises a critical question — is the drop justified, or is TRUMP setting up for a rebound as political narratives regain traction in the crypto space? The Official Trump coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 48 and is trending downward — a potential signal of building selling pressure. Still, broader bullish developments such as expanding crypto adoption, regulated U.S. ETFs, and incoming clarity on crypto regulation could reshape the market in 2025. Bitcoin’s new all-time high of $111,814 on Thursday has fueled renewed optimism that a full-blown bull market may already be underway. If that momentum carries forward, TRUMP could climb back toward the $36 range — halfway to its all-time high of $73.43, reached just two days after launch on January 19. And if major project-specific developments emerge — such as high-profile partnerships or integrations — the Trump meme coin could even surge past resistance levels and make a run toward the $100 mark. Trump Slips, But BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) Powers Ahead with Explosive Presale Momentum While Trump’s coin struggled this week, one high-reward meme coin presale built for Bitcoin maxis quietly raked in thousands. Why just hold BTC—when you can earn it passively by holding the meme coin that rewards every surge? BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) introduces an innovative approach to meme tokens by offering Bitcoin payouts to holders each time BTC hits certain price benchmarks—a concept that’s generating significant buzz across the crypto space. The idea caught on quickly. Just minutes after launching, the project had secured over $100,000 in contributions, eventually raising $6.5 million within three months of presale. Currently available at $0.002535 during its presale, the token’s price is designed to increase with each subsequent round, creating strong incentives for early participation. For those seeking additional passive income streams, $BTCBULL also features a staking mechanism with annual yields reaching up to 63% APY.

2025-05-28T21:38:38.000Z,"AI Crypto Sector Grows 4x in 2 Years, Nears $20B in Market Cap","Over the past year, AI-driven projects have taken center stage in the crypto space. Currently, this sector includes 20 tokens with a collective market cap nearing $20 billion, which makes it the smallest crypto segment at just 0.67% of the overall market. To put this into perspective, the Financials sector holds a market value of about $519 billion. Grayscale attributes the AI sector’s modest size to the early stages of project development but sees significant growth potential ahead, both in absolute terms and as a share of the broader crypto ecosystem. AI Sector is Catching Up Fast Back in 2023, the total market capitalization of tokens in the AI Crypto Sector was only $4.5 billion. Since then, its value has grown over fourfold in a span of two years. Year-to-date, TAO has been the top performer among these assets with a modest gain of 2%, while ElizaOS has been the weakest, plunging by 80%. According to the latest report by Grayscale’s Managing Director of Research, Zach Pandl, and Grayscale Investments Research Analyst Will Ogden Moore, stablecoins could soon play a pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem, particularly as tools for powering AI agents, due to their programmable and efficient payment capabilities. Institutional players like Stripe, Meta, and major banks are entering the space amid improving regulatory prospects. Coinbase has also introduced a stablecoin-ready payments standard for AI. Upcoming regulatory developments, such as the crypto market structure bill and the GENIUS stablecoin bill, could further accelerate adoption. Key Trends in Decentralized AI As decentralized AI technologies rapidly evolve, Grayscale is turning its attention to other key developments, such as Bittensor’s upcoming halving and the expansion of its subnet activity. TAO, the platform’s native token and the largest AI token by circulating market cap, is modeled after Bitcoin with a hard cap of 21 million and a halving every four years, the first expected later this year. Since the dTAO upgrade launched in February, which allowed subnets to be investible, participation has surged. The report revealed that more than 7% of the circulating TAO supply is now allocated to subnets. Grayscale also identified distributed training as a particularly promising area within the AI crypto sector. Prime Intellect, for one, has shown it can train massive models and has surpassed 30 billion parameters, using a global network of idle GPUs, while moving away from reliance on centralized infrastructure. If widely adopted, this model could reduce AI training expenses and broaden accessibility. Meanwhile, projects like Prime, Gensyn, and Nous Research may introduce tokens later in the year. Grass, too, has emerged as a standout in the AI crypto space, reportedly generating tens of millions in annualized revenue from selling web-scraped data to AI labs. This positions it as a rare example of a non-financial, revenue-producing project. The network has steadily increased its data output this year, and a consumer product launch may be on the horizon. Additionally, Virtuals is also seeing strong traction, as it raked in $30 million annually from trading fees on AI agent tokens.

2025-05-28T21:37:08.000Z,"Russia records significant increase in crypto transactions due to Trump effect, the central bank says","Russian cryptocurrency transactions have seen a significant increase, and according to the Bank of Russia, the trend can be attributed in part to Donald Trump’s influence on the market. The monetary authority expects continued support for the industry from the U.S. President’s administration to further stimulate investor interest in digital assets around the world. Sizable increase in Russian crypto activity coincides with Trump’s return to power Crypto asset flows linked to Russian residents have jumped by more than 51% during the last quarter of 2024 and the first three months of 2025, compared to the previous two quarters, the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) pointed out in its latest Financial Stability Review published Wednesday. Assessing the inflows and outflows of funds initiated by Russian users on the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, the financial regulator has put the total volume of these transactions in the said period at 7.3 trillion rubles (over $91 billion at current exchange rates). Commenting on the numbers, the Bank of Russia remarked: “This may be due to the U.S. presidential administration’s policy aimed at softer regulation of the crypto assets market, which has increased interest in the market.” The authors of the study emphasize that sustained support from the current government in Washington may lead to even stronger interest in crypto assets from global investors. They also highlight some of the Trump administration’s main moves in the space, including the decree to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the acceptance of crypto ETF (exchange-traded fund) applications by the U.S. securities regulator. Among the potential risks for Russia, the CBR mentions American intentions to toughen stablecoin rules , which may threaten the activities of Russian businesses using fiat-backed cryptocurrencies like Tether in foreign trade under Western financial restrictions. The bank noted: “Strengthening the regulation of stablecoins in the U.S. will increase sanctions risks for Russian companies, including in connection with the possible blocking of tokens by their issuers.” The surge in crypto activity came despite a 0.9% drop in Russian traffic to the examined trading platforms, which saw over 165 million visits from the country during the studied quarters. Russians’ share of the total registered traffic also dropped by three percentage points to 4.5%. The Central Bank of Russia publishes its financial stability report twice annually. Its latest version does not identify the exchanges included in the analyses, the crypto page of the Russian business news outlet RBC noted. However, the previous edition released in November listed about two dozen platforms most used by Russian traders, including global leaders like Binance and Bybit, as well as some of the most popular platforms in the Russian-speaking segment of the market, such as Exmo and the sanctioned Garantex . Russians own over $10 billion in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins The Bank of Russia has based its assessments on data sourced from “Transparent Blockchain,” a specialized platform developed by the Federal Financial Monitoring Service that allows authorities to track and connect crypto and fiat transactions initiated by Russian citizens and entities. Currently, the state-controlled forensics service is used by financial intelligence units and law enforcement officers in Russia and other countries from the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ), but the plan is to also grant Russian banks access by the end of the year. Relying on information provided by the platform, the Central Bank of Russia was also able to establish that Russian wallets on the analyzed crypto exchanges had balances worth 827 billion rubles in fiat equivalent (over $10.3 billion) as of the end of March 2025. Accounting for 62.1% of the total, Bitcoin (BTC) is the most popular digital asset among Russians. The CBR recently listed the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap among the most profitable investments in the past year. Ether (ETH) ranks second with 22%, while 15.9% of the Russian digital money is held in the stablecoins USDT and USDC.

2025-05-28T21:30:23.000Z,"Ethereum Institutional Interest: Powerful Data Signals Bullish Future","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Institutional Interest: Powerful Data Signals Bullish Future Alright, let’s talk crypto! We’ve all seen Bitcoin (BTC) making headlines recently, surging past significant price levels. It’s easy to get caught up in the Bitcoin frenzy, but guess what? Behind the scenes, something interesting is happening with Ethereum. According to recent data highlighted by CoinDesk, institutional traders – the big players with deep pockets – are quietly showing a growing bullish bias specifically towards ETH. This shift in Ethereum institutional interest is backed by concrete data from futures and options markets, suggesting that while Bitcoin captures the spotlight, smart money might be increasingly looking at Ethereum’s potential. Why the Growing Ethereum Institutional Interest? You might be wondering, with Bitcoin leading the charge, why would institutions start focusing more on Ethereum? It’s a great question, and the answer lies in a combination of factors that make ETH increasingly attractive beyond just being the second-largest crypto by market cap. Ecosystem Strength: Ethereum isn’t just a coin; it’s the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a vast ecosystem of dApps. Institutions recognize the potential of this infrastructure. The Staking Yield: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), investors can earn a yield by staking their ETH. This offers a passive income stream, something traditional finance players understand and appreciate. It’s a significant draw compared to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work model. Upcoming Upgrades: Ethereum’s development roadmap includes significant upgrades aimed at improving scalability and efficiency, such as sharding. These future improvements signal long-term growth potential. Diversification: While Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold, Ethereum is viewed more as digital oil – powering the decentralized economy. Institutions seek diversification, and ETH offers exposure to a different facet of the crypto market. Relative Value: Sometimes, institutions look for assets that may be undervalued relative to their potential or compared to market leaders like Bitcoin. Data suggests they might see more upside potential in ETH at current levels based on its fundamentals and development. These factors contribute to a narrative where Ethereum is seen not just as a speculative asset, but as a technology platform with tangible use cases and potential for generating yield, which aligns well with institutional investment strategies. Decoding the Data: What Are CME ETH Futures and Other Metrics Revealing? The claim of increasing institutional bullishness isn’t just speculation; it’s supported by specific market data points, particularly those favored by institutional participants. Let’s break down the key indicators mentioned: 1. CME Open Interest (OI): What it is: Open interest represents the total number of outstanding futures or options contracts that have not been settled. On regulated exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), CME data is often seen as a proxy for institutional activity because these are the venues institutions typically use due to regulatory compliance and infrastructure. What the data shows: The article highlights that CME ETH futures open interest has seen a massive surge, rising 186% to $3.15 billion since April. This significant increase indicates a substantial amount of new capital entering the Ethereum futures market, primarily from institutional players opening new positions. A rising OI alongside price stability or increase is often interpreted as new money backing the trend. 2. Futures Premiums: What it is: A futures premium (also known as contango) occurs when the price of a futures contract is higher than the current spot price of the underlying asset. This difference reflects the market’s expectation of the asset’s future price, cost of carry, and demand for leveraged long positions. What the data shows: ETH futures premiums hit 10.5%, notably outpacing Bitcoin’s 8.74%. A higher premium on ETH futures compared to BTC suggests stronger demand for leveraged long positions in Ethereum among futures traders, including institutions. It implies traders are willing to pay a higher price for future delivery of ETH, indicating bullish expectations. 3. Risk Reversal Metrics: What it is: Risk reversal is an options trading strategy or metric that involves buying an out-of-the-money (OTM) call option and selling an OTM put option with the same expiration date. The risk reversal rate reflects the difference in implied volatility between OTM calls and OTM puts. A positive risk reversal indicates that OTM calls are relatively more expensive than OTM puts, suggesting a bullish bias (more demand for upside protection/speculation than downside protection). What the data shows: ETH’s risk reversal metrics are signaling stronger bullish sentiment compared to BTC. This means that in the options market, traders are paying a higher premium for the right to buy ETH at a higher price (calls) than for the right to sell ETH at a lower price (puts), relative to the premiums seen in Bitcoin options. This is a clear sign of increasing confidence in Ethereum’s upward potential among options traders, a market also heavily utilized by institutions. 4. Elevated Funding Rates: What it is: Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders holding long and short positions in perpetual futures contracts. When funding rates are positive, long position holders pay short position holders, indicating that longs are dominant and willing to pay to keep their positions open, reflecting bullish sentiment. What the data shows: Elevated funding rates on ETH perpetual futures further confirm rising investor confidence. Consistently high positive funding rates suggest aggressive buying pressure on the long side, which includes both retail and institutional players in the perpetual futures market. Putting it all together, these diverse data points from regulated and unregulated derivatives markets paint a consistent picture: institutions are actively positioning themselves for potential upside in Ethereum, perhaps even more aggressively than in Bitcoin right now, despite BTC’s recent price performance. Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Is Institutional Preference Shifting? For years, Bitcoin has been the undisputed king of institutional crypto adoption. It was the first, the largest, and often the only cryptocurrency considered ‘safe’ enough for traditional portfolios. We saw the launch of Bitcoin futures on CME, Bitcoin trusts, and eventually spot Bitcoin ETFs in various regions, including the US. This wave of crypto institutional adoption was primarily focused on BTC. However, the data we’re seeing now suggests a potential pivot or, at the very least, a significant expansion of focus. While institutions aren’t abandoning Bitcoin, their *marginal* interest and bullish positioning seem to be growing faster for Ethereum. This doesn’t mean ETH will flip BTC tomorrow, but it indicates that institutions are becoming increasingly comfortable with Ethereum as a distinct and valuable investment thesis. Here’s a simple comparison based on the data discussed: Metric Ethereum (ETH) Bitcoin (BTC) Institutional Bias Indicated CME Open Interest Growth (Since April) +186% ($3.15B total) Significant, but ETH growth rate higher Stronger ETH accumulation Futures Premium 10.5% 8.74% Higher demand for ETH long positions Risk Reversal (Options) Stronger Bullish Signal Relatively less bullish signal More appetite for ETH upside exposure Funding Rates (Perpetuals) Elevated Positive Positive (but potentially less elevated than ETH) Aggressive ETH long positioning This comparison clearly illustrates the tilt in positioning. Institutions aren’t just dipping their toes in ETH; they appear to be making a more committed move, viewing Ethereum as a critical component of the digital asset landscape alongside Bitcoin. What Does This Crypto Institutional Adoption Mean for the Market? Increased institutional interest in Ethereum has several potential implications for the broader crypto market: Increased Legitimacy: More institutional involvement lends credibility to Ethereum as an asset class, potentially attracting even more traditional investors. Potential for Reduced Volatility (Long Term): While initial institutional inflows can cause volatility, a mature market with significant institutional holdings can sometimes lead to more stable price action over time, as institutions tend to have longer investment horizons than retail traders. Infrastructure Development: Institutional demand often drives the development of better infrastructure, such as regulated exchanges, custody solutions, and financial products (like potential spot ETH ETFs), making the market more accessible and safer for all participants. Influence on ETH Price: Significant institutional capital flows can have a substantial impact on the ETH price , potentially driving it upwards as demand increases. Halo Effect: Increased focus on Ethereum could potentially draw more attention and capital to the wider Ethereum ecosystem (Layer 2s, DeFi protocols, etc.) and even other smart contract platforms. This growing trend signifies that the narrative around crypto is evolving beyond just Bitcoin as a store of value. Ethereum is being recognized for its utility and ecosystem, opening up new avenues for institutional investment and potentially accelerating the overall pace of crypto institutional adoption . Actionable Insights: Navigating the ETH Price Signals So, what does this mean for you, the everyday crypto enthusiast or investor? While institutional moves are powerful signals, it’s crucial to interpret them correctly and consider the risks. It’s a Bullish Signal, Not a Guarantee: The data strongly suggests a bullish bias, but market sentiment can change quickly. Institutional positioning is one factor among many influencing ETH price . Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t blindly follow institutional money. Understand the fundamentals of Ethereum, its technology, risks, and your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Consider the Long Term: Institutional investors often have a long-term perspective. Their positioning might indicate expectations over months or years, not just days or weeks. Volatility Remains: Despite institutional interest, the crypto market is inherently volatile. Be prepared for price swings. Look Beyond Price: While the potential impact on ETH price is exciting, also consider the underlying developments in the Ethereum ecosystem that are attracting this institutional interest. The increasing Ethereum institutional interest , as evidenced by key data points like CME futures and options metrics, is a significant development. It suggests that sophisticated investors are increasingly confident in Ethereum’s future, viewing it as a strategic asset in the digital economy. While Bitcoin continues to hold its ground, the spotlight is clearly expanding to include Ethereum in a major way. This trend could have lasting effects on market structure, liquidity, and potentially the long-term trajectory of the ETH price . It’s a powerful signal that Ethereum is maturing as an asset class and gaining recognition for its fundamental value and ecosystem strength.

Metaplanet To Issue More Debt For Bitcoin Metaplanet is raising more funds through another bond issue to expand its growing crypto treasury. The bonds carry no interest and have a redemption date of Nov. 27,2025, Metaplanet announced in a post on X on Thursday. The Tokyo-based investment company dubbed “Asia’s MicroStrategy” agreed to issue the debt to EVO FUND, making it the 16th such sale to date. The Cayman Islands-based investment firm has been Metaplanet’s main backer for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, subscribing to several rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds, providing capital for its Bitcoin buying blitz. Metaplanet is currently Asia’s largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder and is the 11th largest globally, as per Bitcoin Treasuries data. The firm started stockpiling Bitcoin in April 2024 after adopting BTC as a core treasury reserve asset, with a stated goal of reaching 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 . The Japanese firm has stated that its strategy is not just about “embracing digital assets, but also about pioneering a future where finance meets innovation at its core.” The debt sale announcement follows Metaplanet’s second-biggest BTC purchase, snatching up 1,004 Bitcoin worth over $100 million. This lifted the company’s Bitcoin stash to 7,800 BTC, valued at more than $800 million. Metaplanet is up roughly 20% on its Bitcoin investments. Metaplanet is notably positioning itself in the mold of Michael Saylor’s Strategy, whose aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy has encouraged an increasing number of publicly traded firms to follow suit. Strategy has accumulated around 580,250 BTC worth $62.3 billion. The timing of Metaplanet’s push into Bitcoin comes as the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency recently set a fresh all-time high of $111,814.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways: Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000. Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time. Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction. Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities. Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: X The chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors. A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking. With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below. Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

2025-05-28T21:21:40.000Z,"Coinbase Floats CDP Wallets to Eliminate Private Key Management","Leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has launched CDP Wallets, a new product for developers in the Web3 space. According to the reports, these wallets give users complete control without managing private keys. Notably, the CDP Wallets are secure, scalable, and easy to integrate. Benefits of Coinbase CDP Wallets This innovation also opens up new opportunities for developers of decentralized apps and crypto projects. One of the exciting features of the CDP Wallets is that they remove the need for developers to manage sensitive private keys or complicated backend systems. Instead, Coinbase CDP Wallets handle all sensitive tasks securely in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These are special pieces of hardware that provide strong security for cryptographic operations. This setup lets developers create customizable wallets using an API, ensuring that the unencrypted private keys are never exposed, even to the exchange. Other features include easy wallet creation, quick signing, and compatibility with popular developer tools like viem, wagmi, and ethers.js. Furthermore, CDP Wallets support EVM chains, Solana, and EIP-712 typed message signing for structured interactions with smart contracts. This approach allows developers to focus on building user-friendly applications instead of spending time and resources securing backend wallet systems. Coinbase Unveils Smart Wallet to Simplify Crypto Trading Recall that the exchange also launched a new smart wallet last year. The wallet is designed to tackle key challenges in the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem, making it easier for new users to get started and reducing transaction costs. As reported by TheCoinRise, the smart wallet is in sync with eight other networks like Ethereum, Base, Avalanche, and others. The smart wallet features simplify all the hurdles in getting started with crypto. Intriguingly, the Coinbase smart wallet is user-friendly and allows new users to set up and use their wallets with little effort. These advantages position it for wider adoption. Coinbase Flexibility Options Last year, the exchange also allowed users to choose between using Lightning and the Bitcoin (BTC) network when making BTC transfers. The exchange integrated a layer-2 Lightning Network to enable customers to perform BTC transitions quickly and cheaply compared to when doing them on the Bitcoin blockchain. Analysts say Coinbase’s new smart wallet and recent initiatives demonstrate the exchange’s commitment to enhancing user experience. The smart wallet’s user-friendliness is seen as a unique selling point. Ultimately, the wallet will help Coinbase expand its services in the competitive cryptocurrency market.

2025-05-28T21:15:24.000Z,"Qubetics Gains $17.5M Traction as Pi Coin Coils and Ethereum Retests—This Trio Tops the Crypto to Invest in for Short Term","Is your crypto portfolio ready for the Next 1,000% ROI candidate? A technical ripple is sweeping across the digital finance arena, and this time it isn’t just about Bitcoin dominance catching attention overnight. Qubetics ($TICS), Pi Coin, and Ethereum are pulling serious weight on the charts. Ethereum is pressing near resistance with crucial price levels in sight, Pi Coin is tightening into a breakout-ready triangle. This week isn’t business as usual—it’s positioning time for those tracking the top crypto to invest in for short term. While Ethereum and Pi Coin refine the tools already in circulation, Qubetics ($TICS) enters with utility-centric firepower, promising real-world interoperability—the kind needed in global logistics, identity access, smart cities, and digital banking infrastructures. It doesn’t merely enhance blockchain; it patches long-standing operational inefficiencies. Early buyers are betting on the functional future, not just flashy performance. Qubetics : Real-World Interoperability Solved Qubetics ($TICS) is engineered as a modular blockchain protocol that bridges operational inefficiencies between existing decentralized networks. It’s not just about scalability or throughput—it brings true interoperability. That means seamless cross-chain communication across healthcare systems, decentralized ID verifications, and even digital remittances without costly delays. In real terms, think of autonomous toll systems exchanging data with digital driver’s licenses across chains, or decentralized banks verifying KYC credentials from multiple networks in milliseconds. Qubetics does not require reconfiguring base layers—it simply slots in, like middleware, to unify fragmented data environments. That makes it particularly compelling as the top crypto to invest in for short term, especially for those watching real-world problem-solving potential. Now at Stage 36 of its crypto presale , Qubetics has already raised over $17.5 million. With more than 27,200 token holders and over 514 million $TICS sold, momentum isn’t slowing. At its current price of $0.3064, projections show a possible ROI of 226% at $1 and up to 4,795% at $15 post-mainnet. That kind of upside has community members scrambling to reserve positions before stage 37 opens. Few projects offer this blend of advanced tech and grounded market use. Pi Coin: A Quiet Build Before the Surge Pi Coin (PI) is crafting something subtle—but that’s where the tension lies. The asset is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern between $0.748 and $0.804, with indicators tightening like a coiled spring. The RSI floats near 47.91, MACD reads 0.00782, and Bollinger Bands are primed for expansion. These aren’t just metrics—they’re signals. The market’s preparing for movement, and community participants are watching the triangle’s apex like a countdown. Analysts suggest a breakout could lift Pi Coin by as much as 20%, targeting resistance at $0.8486 and possibly even breaking the psychological $1.0003 threshold. The bullish outlook isn’t just hypothetical—it’s supported by historical data. Every previous Pi consolidation this narrow preceded a sharp directional move. Timing is everything. Those eyeing the top crypto to invest in for short term need to monitor Pi Coin’s technicals closely. Ethereum: Bullish Retest or Decline Incoming? Ethereum (ETH) is testing waters near $2,640, brushing against its critical resistance at $2,724. Sunday’s retest of its 200-day EMA at $2,451 acted as a springboard, helping ETH rebound by 5%. But traders are wary—this is the third approach to the resistance without a clean breakout. The RSI currently stands at 66, just shy of overbought, and pointing downwards. The MACD’s bearish crossover suggests a potential stalling of upward momentum. If Ethereum fails to close above $2,724 in the coming sessions, price could decline toward its next support at $2,247—right at the 50-day EMA. But a break above $2,724 would pave a route to $3,000, a psychologically significant level. For those seeking the top crypto to invest in for short term, Ethereum’s next move could either trigger a rapid rally or offer a key re-entry point on pullback. Momentum plays are all about timing, and right now, Ethereum is balancing on that edge. Choosing the top crypto to invest in for short term: Strategic Diversification Each protocol covered—Qubetics ($TICS), Pi Coin, and Ethereum—offers distinct value within today’s fast-shifting digital finance environment. Ethereum provides institutional credibility and a robust smart contract ecosystem, though it teeters near key resistance. Pi Coin presents an elegant technical formation likely to erupt soon, perfect for those who favor momentum trades. But Qubetics ($TICS) is the standout for functional growth—its interoperable infrastructure and cross-chain capabilities unlock real-world use cases that are often overlooked in speculative markets. The momentum in Qubetics’ presale reflects more than hype. It shows alignment between advanced tech and practical deployment. Those who understand that utility drives longevity are watching this project for more than short-term gains—they’re tracking adoption readiness. Don’t miss the current stage price of $0.3064, because once Stage 37 kicks off, the path to a 1,000%+ ROI narrows with each tick. Conclusion: The Right Timing for the Right Token Timing isn’t just important in crypto—it’s everything. Ethereum’s next candle could define market structure. Pi Coin may surge on a triangle breakout. But Qubetics ($TICS), with over $17.5 million raised and unmatched real-world use potential, offers a layered opportunity for those seeking the top crypto to invest in for short term . Its ongoing crypto presale could end up being the digital world’s version of getting in before the roads were paved. For those seeking high-potential projects with tangible value, the time to act is now. Visit the Qubetics official site and secure $TICS before the next stage re-prices access. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics considered one of the top crypto to invest in for short term? Because of its strong interoperability features, high presale traction, and real-world utility that addresses longstanding blockchain inefficiencies. What makes Pi Coin’s symmetrical triangle pattern significant? This pattern indicates a narrowing of price volatility, which often precedes a breakout. Traders anticipate a major move soon. Is Ethereum a risky option right now? Ethereum is trading near a critical resistance level. A breakout could lead to a rally, but rejection may signal short-term decline.

2025-05-28T21:13:46.000Z,"Leading AI Claude Predicts the Price of XRP, Pi Coin, and Pepe by End of 2025","The Claude AI chatbot appears to be almost as knowledgeable about crypto and altcoins as ChatGPT. With Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high last week, many believe the market could be on the verge of a new bull cycle. With that in mind, we asked Claude which cryptocurrencies its most looking forward to. In order to get a sense of the projects the AI genuinely values, we had to ask it which projects have the best fundamentals. So, we took three of the hottest coins right now and asked it to rank them on this metric. XRP: The Project Claude AI Names as the Most Likely Contender Ripple’s XRP , the flagship token behind the company’s blockchain-based payment system, remains at the forefront of the digital finance revolution because, like Claude AI says, it has the strongest fundamentals for steady growth. It recently secured a vote of confidence from the United Nations, which acknowledged its potential role in facilitating a global digital payments network with regulatory oversight. Adding to its momentum, former U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that XRP could be incorporated into a proposed Strategic Crypto Reserve as a “hold-only” asset (ie, the US government can hold confiscated $XRP but cannot buy it)—a development that’s placing the coin squarely on the geopolitical radar. Despite following Bitcoin’s recent price corrections, XRP has shown resilience, holding firm around the $2 support level and eyeing a possible breakout past the $3 resistance by mid-year. With favorable market trends and growing legitimacy, XRP may be on the verge of a catalytic upswing, according to Claude AI. Pi Network ($PI): A Novel Take on Crypto Mining with Explosive Price Potential Pi Network is turning heads as a user-friendly blockchain project that introduces a simple tap-to-earn model. Launched in February 2025, the $PI token surged 40% in the first two weeks of May, in a whale-assisted recovery rally that ebbed a little shortly afterward. Although currently undergoing a minor 3.3% intraday correction—its RSI sails at a neutral 48—suggesting the market is pricing this one fairly. Claude AI calls this one a wild card, but if its team can flesh out the ecosystem, many believe it could surpass the $3 milestone in a couple of months. Unlike traditional mining, Pi requires no advanced hardware. Users simply open the app and tap a button once per day to mine tokens, making it highly accessible and appealing to casual users. This innovative model, combined with Pi Network’s Layer 1 architecture, could make it a standout performer in the months ahead. Pepe ($PEPE): The Meme Coin That Spawned a Frog-Fueled Movement Rooted in the legacy of Matt Furie’s internet-famous frog, Pepe ($PEPE) has become a cornerstone of meme coin culture and a wealth generator for early adopters. It has consistently ranked among the top three meme coins since late 2024. Since its debut in April 2023, Pepe has ignited a trend of frog-themed tokens, though none have matched its impact or performance. Currently priced near $0.0000136, $PEPE has risen 58% in the past thirty days, making it easily the best performing among the coins named here throughout May—XRP and Pi actually lost value. With a market cap of roughly $5.7 billion, it is the biggest non-doge-themed project among meme coins. Despite this momentum, it remains 51.5% below its December 2024 peak of $0.00002803. However, technical charts show a potential breakout from a descending wedge pattern that formed between November and March. Analysts anticipate that this could lead to a new all-time high by late summer as trading volume and optimism continue to rise. MIND of Pepe ($MIND): Where Meme Culture Meets AI Innovation in a Bot More Useful than Claude for Crypto Fans Blending viral internet iconography with cutting-edge artificial intelligence, MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is carving out a unique niche in the meme coin ecosystem. While cosmetically inspired by the legendary Pepe meme, its true strength lies in functionality—offering users an AI-powered assistant that delivers live crypto market insights, sentiment analysis, and behavioral data. The MIND AI assistant recently made its debut on X (formerly known as Twitter), where it now engages directly with the community and shares frequent market updates. Ten Million. $MIND pic.twitter.com/yVFKn23P8H — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 23, 2025 Supported by a robust $10.9 million in initial funding, the $MIND token also includes a high-yield staking feature with returns of up to 215% APY, positioning it as a top-tier option for earning passive income within the crypto space. Analysts speculate that once MIND of Pepe ($MIND) secures listings on major exchanges, it could approach the $1 mark, representing an astonishing potential surge of 26,556% from its current valuation. This places it among the most lucrative opportunities in the meme token sector.

2025-05-28T21:01:33.000Z,"U.S. Department of Labor Reverses Crypto Guidance, Opens Door for 401(k) Bitcoin Exposure","Key Takeaways: The Trump administration has eliminated regulatory barriers that previously discouraged employers from offering cryptocurrency options in workplace retirement plans. The prior guidance warned employers to use “extreme care” and launched investigations into plan sponsors offering crypto options. Despite the change, crypto remains rare in 401(k) plans; fewer than 1% include digital assets, according to a 2024 GAO report. The U.S. Department of Labor has rescinded a 2022 policy that discouraged the inclusion of cryptocurrency in workplace 401(k) plans, as stated in a news release on May 28. The reversal marks a major policy shift, indicating a return to a neutral regulatory stance and potentially reigniting interest in crypto investment options for retirement accounts. Labor Dept. Ends ‘Extreme Caution’ Guidance on Crypto in 401(k) Plans The earlier guidance , issued under the Biden administration, warned employers to exercise “extreme care” before offering digital assets like Bitcoin in employee retirement plans. It also introduced an “investigative program” directed at sponsors who offered crypto through direct menus or self-directed brokerage windows. That approach had a chilling effect on adoption, causing some firms to rethink plans to add crypto options. The reversal announced on May 28 by the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration said the 2022 guidance had overstepped its bounds. JUST IN: US Labor Department rescinds 2022 guidance that warned fiduciaries against including crypto in 401(k) plans. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) May 28, 2025 According to the agency, the guidance conflicted with the department’s legal obligation to remain neutral on investment choices offered in retirement plans. “The Biden administration’s Department of Labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” said Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not DC bureaucrats.” The change may reopen the door for firms like Fidelity, which had begun exploring crypto offerings for 401(k)s before the previous policy took effect. However, the broader financial industry has shown limited enthusiasm for alternative assets in retirement accounts. Crypto remains rare in 401(k) plans. A 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office found that fewer than 1% of defined-contribution plans included digital assets, with only 69 crypto-based investment options available nationwide. Critics argue that retirement accounts should focus on stable, long-term investments, not volatile assets like Bitcoin. The crypto industry, meanwhile, maintains that digital assets democratize access and offer new opportunities for everyday investors. ForUsAll Inc., the first U.S. crypto 401(k) recordkeeper, had tried and failed to overturn the Biden-era guidance in court last year. A federal judge ruled that reversing the policy would not revive the company’s business. The Labor Department says it will neither endorse nor disapprove specific assets. Fiduciaries remain responsible for assessing whether crypto, or any other investment, is appropriate for their plans. U.S. Regulators Loosen Crypto Restrictions, Paving Way for Broader Institutional Adoption The Department of Labor’s reversal on crypto restrictions is the latest in a wave of federal rollbacks reshaping how digital assets are treated across the U.S. financial system. Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, his administration has taken a markedly pro-crypto stance . Trump himself has openly embraced the industry, launching a meme coin, $TRUMP, and announcing plans to build a Bitcoin treasury through his media company. Federal agencies have followed suit. For example, in March, the FDIC rescinded its 2022 policy requiring banks to seek prior approval before engaging in crypto-related activities. The @FDICgov revised its crypto policy, letting banks engage in digital asset services without prior approval. Oversight continues through post-notification reviews. #CryptoRegulation #FDIC https://t.co/lOsoTfKKtN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 29, 2025 The updated guidance, FIL-7-2025, permits FDIC-supervised banks to offer crypto services, provided they manage associated risks and adhere to safety and soundness standards. While banks must notify the agency, prior approval is no longer required. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also relaxed restrictions in March , allowing national banks and federal savings associations to engage in crypto custody, stablecoin activities, and distributed ledger participation without needing supervisory nonobjection. Acting Comptroller Rodney E. Hood said the shift reflects the agency’s improved understanding of crypto and its plan to foster responsible innovation. In April, the Federal Reserve joined the pivot, withdrawing 2022 and 2023 guidance that discouraged state banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin operations, indicating a coordinated regulatory shift favoring digital assets in 2025.

Russia’s heightening partnership with the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) is steering a rapid move away from the U.S. dollar. Sergey Ryabkov, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister, recently emphasized the push for using local currencies and advancing non-dollar financing as part of Moscow’s bid to loosen Western financial dominance. Western sanctions, intensified after each escalation, restrict Russian access to global markets, technology, and finance, damaging sectors like energy exports and banking. https://t.co/5BDXUP4Pyv — Amir Hemati (@realamirhemati) May 26, 2025 BRICS members, led by NDB’s Dilma Rousseff, view sanctions as roadblocks to trade and development; however, the shift towards multipolar finance could boost demand for Bitcoin.

India’s Tax Reforms Could Supercharge BTC Adoption Optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s possible return has sparked a push for crypto tax cuts in India. Industry leaders are lobbying to replace the current 1% transaction levy and 30% capital gains tax with a simpler 0.1% fee. Crypto Comeback in India? After a brutal 30% tax in 2022 drove 90% of crypto trading offshore, tides may be turning. As per the FT , the Indian government is holding weekly policy talks, and tax cuts are on the table.

Moreover, lower taxes have the potential to attract millions of new users. It can drive increasing Bitcoin adoption and potentially drive up prices. However, confusion over crypto regulations and outdated laws still pose hurdles. If India’s government embraces these changes, Bitcoin could strengthen its position as a leading global financial asset. Bitcoin Chart Patterns Show BTC’s Reversal Potential Technically, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bearish amid BTC’s recent breakdown from a symmetrical triangle, suggesting short-term bearishness; however, the setup remains promising. Price action near the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $107,060 shows indecision, with spinning top candles suggesting a pause. Support zones around $105,900 and $104,256—where higher lows were established—could offer a solid base for a rebound. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A closer look at the MACD reveals a bearish crossover and deepening histogram, but a bullish divergence might emerge. If a bullish engulfing or three white soldiers pattern forms near support, a rally could ignite. The EMA 50 trends downward but hovers near price, hinting that a break above $108,200 could drive a move toward $109,631 or even $111,935. Trade Setup: Consider a cautious long entry around $106,000–$105,900 if reversal patterns and MACD signals align. Set stops below $104,200, with initial targets at $108,200 and $109,600. A decisive reclaim of $107,000 would signal momentum, but failure could see a dip to $104,256. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.50M Mark as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With BTC/USD dipping below $108,000, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.002535 before the next bump.

The portability aspect, it's instantly transferable across the globe, whereas gold is bulky and very expensive to ship, the authenticity is instantly verified via the blockchain. You can easily secure Bitcoin in a wallet, whereas gold requires insurance, and it is very expensive.\"" The CEO also cited the absolute scarcity of Bitcoin and the potential for gold's inflation rate to increase due to technological advancements as a factor in favor of choosing Bitcoin over gold for long-term value storage.

2025-05-28T20:51:11.000Z,"As Miner Revenues Rebound to $50M+/Day, TeraHash Prepares to Unlock Mining Yields for Over 8 Million Users","Bitcoin has officially broken through the $117,000 mark the other day – its strongest rally in months, reigniting interest not only in price speculation but in the infrastructure behind the scenes: mining. As the most popular cryptocurrency surges again, miners have stepped up operations, sending daily exchange inflows to nearly 50 BTC per day, a sharp rise from the 25 BTC daily observed earlier this quarter. While still below historical peaks of 100 BTC/day, this doubling in activity signals renewed confidence among miners – and capitalizing on this trend, investor appetite is following closely. According to recent data, cumulative miner earnings have climbed back to $51.6 million per day, up significantly from local lows and showing potential for further upside. Again, while not yet at the all-time highs of $80 million/day, the current numbers underscore a robust post-halving rebound, and an increasingly competitive market for Bitcoin yield. Amid this backdrop, TeraHash , the soon-to-launch protocol built by one of the industry’s largest mining players, is stepping into the spotlight. Designed to provide simplified access to Bitcoin mining-based rewards, TeraHash removes the need for hardware, hosting contracts, or complex infrastructure. Backed by 8 million early users from its viral Telegram-based mining game HashCats, the protocol is now positioning itself to become one of the largest tokenized mining network in crypto. It offers a hardware-free, on-chain alternative just as global interest in mining surges again. In recent days, that promise has quietly turned into conversation – with growing chatter across Telegram, X, and Discord fueling curiosity and pulling more eyes toward what might be one of the most unconventional protocol launches this cycle. The Low-Key Start to What Might Become the One of the Largest Bitcoin Mining Protocol Amid the flood of Telegram bots, stickers, and trading alpha groups, mini-apps took off in 2024. What started with simple “tap-to-earn” games, like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat, quickly evolved into a new kind of onboarding funnel. With nothing but a few taps, tens of millions of users were interacting with crypto mechanics, often without even realizing it. Some games were speculative, some were just memes, but one of them, HashCats , laid the groundwork for something bigger. This mining-themed simulation, launched in mid-2024, where users upgraded cartoonish rigs, optimized power usage, and managed reward cycles, all while competing for yield with digital cats. But beneath the memes and mechanics was something far more ambitious: a stealth onboarding funnel into one of the most capital-intensive sectors in crypto – Bitcoin mining. Within months, HashCats exploded to over 8 million users, making it one of the most viral mini-apps of the Telegram era. But unlike typical Web3 games, HashCats didn’t just build engagement — it seeded understanding. Players simulated halvings, optimized hashrate, and learned mining dynamics. Behind the scenes, a real mining infrastructure was being assembled. That infrastructure now has a name: TeraHash. The Logic Behind TeraHash’s Simpler Approach to Bitcoin Mining TeraHash offers a different path to mining : access rewards without ever owning a rig. At the heart of the protocol is $THS, a tokenized unit representing 1 terahash per second (TH/s) of live, protocol-operated hashrate. Instead of navigating hardware lead times or energy contracts, users simply acquire $THS and stake it on the platform to get rewards from mining. No machines. No hosting. No downtime. But TeraHash also introduces a second asset, $HASH, born from the HashCats ecosystem, designed to deepen network participation through governance and a clever rewards redistribution mechanism: when users forget to stake their $THS, idle rewards are distributed among those staking $HASH in solo staking format or dual staking together with $THS tokens. Infrastructure With Proof, Not Promises Unlike earlier attempts at tokenized mining, TeraHash commits to verifiability. The team has announced plans for quarterly audits, public dashboards, and proof-of-hashrate attestation, ensuring the number of circulating $THS tokens does not exceed the live hashrate under protocol control. This move aligns with growing scrutiny around transparency in Bitcoin mining, especially as large-scale operations increasingly intersect with ESG debates, sovereign policy shifts, and grid impact concerns. In a recent example, Texas mining hubs reported up to 20% of grid participation during peak hours, renewing calls for both regulatory oversight and more transparent accounting from mining protocols. TeraHash aims to stay ahead of this curve by embedding trust at the protocol level, where every token is verifiably backed, and every reward is traceable on-chain. Bitcoin Mining Could Significantly Evolve in the Months Ahead With its July launch fast approaching, TeraHash is positioning $THS as a new programmable utility token, akin to how ETH represents staking. The team has publicly committed to targeting $5 billion worth of tokenized mining power over the next three years, signaling ambitions not just to participate in the mining market, but to reshape how it’s accessed. Integration efforts are already underway, with discussions around DeFi collateralization, dual-staking models, and wallet-level mining exposure. In essence, TeraHash is launching a token and laying the groundwork for a programmable mining layer, one that could plug directly into the rest of crypto’s capital flows, at the same time. For the 8 million who started by clicking on cartoon cats, and for the many more watching Bitcoin miner revenues rise again, TeraHash represents something new: a way into mining that’s not gated by geography, capital, or kilowatt contracts – just code, tokens, and transparent infrastructure.

2025-05-28T20:50:44.000Z,"Urgent: Bitcoin Options Show Bearish Sentiment as Bitcoin 2025 Kicks Off","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Bitcoin Options Show Bearish Sentiment as Bitcoin 2025 Kicks Off Are you watching the cryptocurrency market closely? As the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference gets underway, a notable shift is occurring in the derivatives space, specifically within the Bitcoin options market. Recent analysis indicates that traders are adopting a cautious, if not outright bearish, stance. This sentiment is particularly interesting given the historical tendency for major events to inject volatility into the market. What’s Driving the Bearish Sentiment in Bitcoin Options? According to Adam, a respected macro researcher at Greeks.live, the mood among Bitcoin options traders is currently leaning bearish. His observations, shared on the social platform X, highlight a preference for put options, which are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell Bitcoin at a specified price by a certain date. An increase in demand for put options relative to call options (which bet on price increases) is a classic indicator of bearish sentiment . Traders seem to be anticipating increased volatility around the Bitcoin 2025 conference. Large industry events often serve as catalysts for significant price movements, and it appears options traders are positioning themselves to potentially profit from or hedge against a downside move. Adam noted that many traders are not only holding bearish put positions but are also planning to increase them, suggesting conviction in their outlook. Why is Bitcoin 2025 a Potential Catalyst? The Bitcoin 2025 conference is a major gathering for the crypto community, bringing together developers, investors, companies, and enthusiasts. Historically, such events can lead to: Major Announcements: New product launches, partnerships, or regulatory discussions could significantly impact market perception. Increased Attention: The event draws mainstream and institutional focus, potentially increasing trading volume and price swings. Shifting Narratives: Discussions at the conference can reinforce or challenge existing market narratives, influencing trader psychology. While these factors could theoretically push the price in either direction, the current positioning in the Bitcoin options market suggests a bias towards preparing for a potential downturn or significant turbulence that favors those betting on lower prices. Expert Insights and BTC Price Prediction The analysis from Greeks.live provides a snapshot of this market positioning. Adam’s report underscores that this isn’t just retail speculation; it reflects the sentiment among potentially larger players in the options market. This kind of insight is crucial for understanding the short-term dynamics influenced by sophisticated trading strategies. Interestingly, alongside the general bearish tilt in options, there are specific BTC price prediction points being discussed. Some traders reportedly predict a potential surge first, perhaps reaching highs around $120,000, before a significant correction down to the $102,000 level. This indicates that the bearish view isn’t necessarily a belief in an immediate crash, but rather an expectation of a volatile period that might include an initial peak followed by a notable dip. This ‘up-then-down’ scenario is common in volatile markets and highlights the complex strategies employed by options traders who can profit from movement in either direction, or specifically hedge against unexpected turns after a potential peak. Further reinforcing the cautious outlook, Adam mentioned that algorithmic trading reports also show a slightly bearish outlook. Algorithmic trading systems often rely on quantitative models and historical data to execute trades, and their current positioning suggests that technical indicators or patterns are aligning with a less optimistic near-term view for Bitcoin’s price action. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Analysis What does this crypto market analysis mean for you as a participant? The dominance of bearish sentiment in the options market, especially tied to a major event like Bitcoin 2025, signals a period of potential heightened volatility and uncertainty. It’s a strong reminder that even during periods of potential excitement or bullish long-term outlooks, the short-term market can be heavily influenced by hedging and speculative strategies in the derivatives space. Key takeaways from this analysis include: Options Market as a Bellwether: The options market can offer insights into how sophisticated traders are positioning themselves for future price movements and volatility. Event-Driven Volatility: Major conferences like Bitcoin 2025 are often associated with increased market activity and potential price swings. Conflicting Signals: While some predict potential highs like $120,000, the dominant options positioning is defensive or bearish, anticipating a correction. Algorithmic Confirmation: The slightly bearish stance from algorithmic trading adds another layer to the cautious outlook. For traders and investors, this period necessitates careful risk management. Understanding that a significant portion of the market is braced for potential downside or high volatility is crucial. It might be a time to re-evaluate position sizes, set stop-losses, or explore hedging strategies if you hold significant spot positions. In conclusion, the commencement of Bitcoin 2025 coincides with a distinct shift towards bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin options market. Analysis from sources like Greeks.live points to traders favoring puts and preparing for volatility, potentially involving an initial price surge followed by a correction, aligning with some specific BTC price prediction targets. This comprehensive crypto market analysis underscores the need for vigilance and strategic planning as the market navigates this potentially turbulent period driven by event-specific expectations and sophisticated trading plays.

2025-05-28T20:40:47.000Z,"GameStop Bitcoin Purchase: Shocking 4,710 BTC Investment Revealed","BitcoinWorld GameStop Bitcoin Purchase: Shocking 4,710 BTC Investment Revealed In a move that sent ripples through both the traditional stock market and the cryptocurrency world, GameStop, the iconic video game retailer, has officially announced a significant investment in Bitcoin. The company revealed via its official communication channels that it has acquired a substantial amount of the leading digital asset, marking a notable step into the realm of corporate cryptocurrency holdings. What is the Scale of the GameStop Bitcoin Investment? The core of the announcement is the specific quantity of Bitcoin now held by GameStop. According to the company’s disclosure on its official X account, GameStop has purchased 4,710 BTC. This figure represents a considerable allocation, especially for a company navigating a significant business transformation. To put this into perspective, based on recent market prices at the time of the announcement, this acquisition is valued at tens of millions of U.S. dollars. This makes GameStop one of the public companies holding Bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves. The announcement was concise but impactful, delivered directly to the public and its dedicated community, often referred to as ‘apes’ or ‘redditors’, who have been closely following the company’s journey and have shown significant interest in digital assets. Why Would GameStop Pursue a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? GameStop’s decision to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors could be driving this strategic move: Treasury Diversification: Like many companies, GameStop holds cash reserves. Holding a portion of these reserves in Bitcoin can be seen as a strategy to diversify away from traditional fiat currencies and potentially hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. Alignment with Community: GameStop’s core community is heavily engaged online and often overlaps with individuals interested in technology, disruption, and digital assets. Embracing Bitcoin could resonate strongly with this key demographic, further solidifying their connection to the brand. Exploration of New Technologies: GameStop has previously shown interest in Web3 and NFTs, albeit with mixed results. A direct investment in Bitcoin could signal a deeper commitment to understanding and potentially integrating with blockchain technology in the future. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term appreciation potential. GameStop might view this investment as a way to grow its treasury value over time, though this comes with inherent risks. This move positions GameStop alongside other public companies that have embraced a corporate Bitcoin strategy, signaling a growing trend among forward-thinking businesses. How Does GameStop’s Holding Compare to Other Companies with Bitcoin Treasury? While 4,710 BTC is a significant amount for GameStop, it’s helpful to compare it to other major corporate holders to understand its relative scale in the broader landscape of institutional Bitcoin adoption . Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla are well-known for their substantial Bitcoin holdings. Here’s a simplified comparison (Note: exact figures for other companies fluctuate as they may buy/sell or disclose updates): Company Approximate BTC Holding MicroStrategy > 200,000 BTC Tesla ~ 9,720 BTC GameStop (GME) 4,710 BTC As you can see, GameStop’s holding is smaller than industry leaders like MicroStrategy but is still a notable amount, placing it among a growing list of public companies that have chosen to allocate capital to the digital asset space. This move adds to the narrative of increasing corporate interest in the asset class. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for GameStop (GME) Holding BTC? Like any strategic financial decision, holding Bitcoin comes with its own set of potential benefits and challenges for GameStop: Potential Benefits: Potential for Capital Appreciation: If the price of Bitcoin increases, the value of GameStop’s treasury holdings would also increase, potentially boosting its balance sheet. Attracting Tech-Savvy Investors: The move could appeal to investors interested in companies that are forward-thinking and embracing digital technologies. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, which could be a factor in protecting the purchasing power of their reserves. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile. A significant downturn could negatively impact the value of GameStop’s holdings and potentially affect its financial statements. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent loss or theft. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could introduce unforeseen challenges. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex and is subject to specific rules (like FASB updates in the US). GameStop must navigate these complexities carefully as it manages its new GME BTC asset. What Actionable Insights Can We Glean from This Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? GameStop’s entry into holding Bitcoin provides several insights for observers of both the stock market and the crypto space: Growing Corporate Interest: This is another data point suggesting that companies are increasingly considering Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset, moving beyond early adopters. Community Influence: For companies with highly engaged, digitally native communities, aligning corporate strategy with community interests (like crypto) can be a powerful factor. Transformation Efforts: GameStop’s willingness to make such a bold move highlights its ongoing efforts to transform its business model beyond traditional retail. Market Signal: While not the largest holder, GameStop’s brand recognition means this move could encourage other companies, particularly those with similar customer demographics, to explore cryptocurrency. This development underscores the broadening appeal of Bitcoin beyond individual investors and dedicated crypto firms, highlighting the trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . In Conclusion: GameStop’s Bold Step into Bitcoin GameStop’s disclosure of its 4,710 BTC purchase is more than just a line item on a balance sheet; it’s a statement. It signifies the company’s willingness to embrace new financial technologies and potentially align itself more closely with the digital future and the interests of its passionate community. While the amount is modest compared to the largest corporate holders, it represents a substantial commitment for GameStop and adds another layer to the narrative of corporate treasury diversification into digital assets. This move will be watched closely by investors and analysts alike, eager to see how this corporate Bitcoin strategy impacts GameStop’s financial health and market perception in the volatile world of both meme stocks and cryptocurrencies. The integration of GME BTC into the company’s assets marks a significant milestone in its ongoing evolution.

2025-05-28T20:30:04.000Z,"Forex Market Uncertainty: US Dollar Gains Tremble","BitcoinWorld Forex Market Uncertainty: US Dollar Gains Tremble In the dynamic world of global finance, where every ripple can create waves felt in markets from stocks to cryptocurrencies, the recent movement of the US Dollar has caught attention. While it has shown a tendency to edge higher, a cloud of uncertainty looms large over the sustainability of these gains. For those navigating the crypto landscape, understanding the dollar’s trajectory is key, as its strength or weakness often correlates inversely with risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Understanding the Current US Dollar Position The dollar, measured against a basket of other major currencies (the DXY index), has seen periods of modest appreciation. This upward movement is often influenced by several factors: Safe-haven demand during times of global economic or geopolitical stress. Expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Relative economic performance compared to other major economies. However, this Currency strength has not been a one-way street. The gains have been tentative, often reversing course quickly, indicating a lack of strong conviction among market participants. This hesitant performance is what fuels the uncertainty we are currently observing in the Forex market . Why Are US Dollar Gains Facing Uncertainty? The primary drivers behind the cautious outlook for the dollar are multifaceted. Several key elements contribute to this environment: 1. Federal Reserve Policy Ambiguity: The market is constantly trying to predict the next move from the Federal Reserve . Will they cut Interest rates ? When? How many times? The Fed’s communication, or lack thereof, on the future path of monetary policy creates significant volatility and uncertainty for the dollar. 2. Inflation Data Volatility: Recent inflation reports have been mixed. While headline inflation has shown signs of cooling, core inflation remains sticky in some areas. The Fed’s decisions are heavily data-dependent, particularly on inflation and employment. Any surprising data releases can quickly shift market expectations regarding Interest rates , directly impacting the dollar’s value. 3. Global Economic Outlook: The economic health of other major regions (like the Eurozone, China, Japan) also plays a role. If other economies show signs of strengthening or if their central banks adopt more hawkish stances, it can reduce the relative appeal of the dollar. 4. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing global conflicts and political instability can sometimes boost the dollar as a safe haven, but they can also disrupt trade and economic activity, adding another layer of unpredictability. The Federal Reserve’s Pivotal Role and Interest Rates Perhaps the most significant factor influencing the dollar’s short-to-medium term outlook is the action, or inaction, of the Federal Reserve . The Fed controls the benchmark Interest rates in the United States. Higher interest rates typically make a country’s currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns on their fixed-income investments, thus increasing demand for the currency. Conversely, expectations of lower Interest rates can weaken the dollar. The current debate revolves around when the Fed will begin cutting rates after a period of aggressive hikes. Market participants are constantly adjusting their forecasts based on every speech by a Fed official and every piece of economic data. This continuous recalibration creates the uncertainty that prevents the dollar from establishing a clear, strong trend. Here’s a simplified look at the relationship: Factor Potential Dollar Impact Higher Inflation Data Could signal Fed holds rates higher longer → Potential Dollar Strength Weaker Jobs Data Could signal Fed cuts rates sooner → Potential Dollar Weakness Hawkish Fed Commentary (leaning towards hikes/holding) Potential Dollar Strength Dovish Fed Commentary (leaning towards cuts) Potential Dollar Weakness Navigating the Forex Market : Implications for Other Assets The uncertainty surrounding the US Dollar has ripple effects across the entire financial system, including the Forex market itself, commodity markets, and digital assets. A stronger dollar makes US exports more expensive and imports cheaper. For international investors, a strong dollar can make US assets, including stocks and bonds, more expensive when converted from their local currency. For the cryptocurrency market, a strong dollar is often seen as a headwind. Cryptocurrencies are generally considered risk assets. When the dollar strengthens, it can indicate a ‘risk-off’ sentiment in the market, where investors prefer the safety of dollar-denominated assets. Conversely, a weakening dollar can signal ‘risk-on’ behavior, potentially benefiting assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The current uncertainty means this relationship is not always straightforward. Periods of dollar strength might coincide with crypto rallies if other factors (like positive crypto-specific news or institutional adoption) are at play. However, the general macroeconomic backdrop, heavily influenced by dollar dynamics and Interest rates set by the Federal Reserve , remains a crucial element to monitor. Key Data and Events to Watch To better gauge the potential direction of the US Dollar and understand the underlying uncertainty, market participants are closely watching specific economic releases and events: Inflation Reports (CPI, PPI): Provide insight into price pressures, directly influencing Fed policy expectations. Employment Data (Non-Farm Payrolls, Wage Growth): Indicates the health of the labor market, another key metric for the Federal Reserve . Retail Sales: Reflects consumer spending, a major component of economic activity. Manufacturing and Services PMIs: Offer a look into the health of different sectors of the economy. Federal Reserve Meetings and Speeches: Direct communication from policymakers regarding their economic outlook and plans for Interest rates . Paying attention to these data points and understanding how they might influence the Fed’s stance on Interest rates is vital for anyone with exposure to the Forex market or risk assets. Challenges and Opportunities Amidst Uncertainty The current environment presents both challenges and potential opportunities. The primary challenge is volatility and unpredictability. Sudden shifts in dollar value can impact investment portfolios quickly. For businesses involved in international trade, hedging against currency fluctuations becomes more complex. However, uncertainty can also create opportunities. Periods of dollar weakness might offer entry points into assets that are typically inversely correlated. For traders, increased volatility in the Forex market can provide trading opportunities, provided they have robust risk management strategies in place. Understanding the interplay between the US Dollar , Federal Reserve policy, and global economic trends is key to navigating these conditions. Conclusion: Awaiting Clarity The US Dollar’s recent move higher is undeniable, but the conviction behind it is weak. The path forward remains clouded by uncertainty, primarily driven by evolving expectations around the Federal Reserve’s approach to Interest rates and the broader global economic picture. While the dollar may continue to see periods of strength, significant and sustained gains appear unlikely until there is more clarity on monetary policy and a clearer global economic trend emerges. Market participants, including those in the crypto space, should remain vigilant, paying close attention to key economic indicators and central bank communications that will ultimately shape the dollar’s direction in the volatile Forex market .

If you’ve been following the world of cryptocurrencies, especially the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets, you’ve likely heard of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. Led by Michael Saylor, the company pioneered the corporate treasury strategy of holding significant amounts of Bitcoin (BTC). Their aggressive Strategy Bitcoin accumulation has been a major market narrative for years. However, recent reports suggest a shift in pace. Is Strategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Changing? According to analysis by The Block, Strategy is indeed continuing its policy of acquiring Bitcoin, but the speed at which they are adding BTC to their balance sheet appears to be moderating. This isn’t necessarily a halt or a reversal, but rather a downshift from the rapid pace seen in previous periods. The company recently announced another significant purchase: 4,020 BTC, acquired for approximately $427 million. While this is a substantial sum, it represents a lower volume compared to some of their previous weekly or monthly purchase figures during peak accumulation phases. This observation raises questions about the factors influencing their buying decisions. Why the Slower Pace for MicroStrategy BTC Buying? Several intertwined factors seem to be contributing to this adjusted pace, as highlighted by the report: Declining Premium on MSTR Stock: Historically, investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset often turned to MSTR stock. Strategy’s shares traded at a significant premium over the value of the company’s underlying assets, largely driven by the market valuing the stock based on its large BTC holdings. This premium essentially allowed Strategy to raise capital (often via stock offerings) at a valuation significantly higher than its software business alone, making BTC acquisition through equity financing very attractive. However, this premium has been shrinking. Increased Competition in Institutional Bitcoin Access: When Strategy began its aggressive buying in 2020, direct institutional access to Bitcoin was limited. Now, the landscape has changed dramatically. The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets has provided investors with a regulated, easily accessible, and often lower-fee alternative to gain BTC exposure. This increased competition means investors no longer solely rely on MSTR stock as the primary vehicle for institutional Bitcoin exposure. The report notes that the premium on MSTR Stock recently dropped to 163%, which is the lowest level recorded since April 8th. A lower stock premium means that raising capital through equity is less ‘efficient’ in terms of acquiring Bitcoin compared to when the premium was significantly higher. This directly impacts the economics of their preferred acquisition method. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Competition The rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs and other institutional products has fundamentally altered the market dynamics. Investors who previously might have bought MSTR shares as a proxy for BTC now have direct, regulated options. This diversification of investment avenues for Institutional Bitcoin exposure naturally spreads demand across different products and companies, rather than concentrating it heavily on Strategy’s stock. This competitive pressure reduces the unique advantage Strategy once held in the market for publicly traded companies with significant BTC exposure. While Strategy remains the largest corporate holder by a vast margin, the availability of alternatives dilutes the premium investors are willing to pay solely for the ‘Bitcoin proxy’ aspect of their stock. Strategy’s Current Bitcoin Holdings: A Colossal Figure Despite the recent slowdown in the acquisition pace, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings remain immense. The company now holds over 580,000 BTC. To put this into perspective, this represents approximately 2.75% of Bitcoin’s total estimated supply of 21 million coins. This staggering figure solidifies their position as the leading corporate accumulator of the digital asset. This massive accumulation started in August 2020 and has continued consistently through various market cycles, demonstrating a long-term commitment to their Bitcoin treasury strategy. Their journey involved various financing methods, including issuing convertible notes and selling stock, heavily leveraging the premium on their shares to fund BTC Acquisition . Understanding the MSTR Stock Premium The premium on MSTR Stock is a key metric for understanding Strategy’s funding strategy. It’s calculated by comparing the market capitalization of Strategy to the value of its Bitcoin holdings plus the value of its core software business. When the stock trades at a high premium, the market is essentially assigning a higher value to the company than the sum of its parts, largely because of the perceived value and scarcity of getting direct, large-scale Bitcoin exposure through a publicly traded company. Here’s a simplified breakdown: High Premium: Market Cap >> (Value of BTC Holdings + Value of Software Business). This makes raising capital via stock sales very attractive for buying more BTC. Lower Premium: Market Cap ≈ (Value of BTC Holdings + Value of Software Business). The advantage of using equity to fund BTC purchases diminishes. The recent drop in this premium suggests the market is recalibrating how it values MSTR, likely due to the new, more direct ways investors can get Bitcoin exposure via products like spot ETFs. This doesn’t mean the premium is gone, but it’s less exaggerated than it was during peak enthusiasm and limited alternatives. What’s Next for Strategy and Corporate BTC Adoption? Strategy’s approach has always been unique due to its scale and consistency. While the pace might slow, their commitment to Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset appears unchanged. Michael Saylor and the company leadership have consistently articulated their long-term bullish view on Bitcoin. The competitive landscape for Institutional Bitcoin is likely to continue evolving. As more traditional financial players enter the space and offer regulated products, the ways institutions and individuals gain exposure will diversify further. This could potentially put continued pressure on the MSTR stock premium over time. However, Strategy’s massive existing holdings mean they remain a significant player and their future moves will continue to be watched closely by the market. Their strategy has inspired other companies, albeit on a smaller scale, to consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The challenges they face now, like managing a lower stock premium and navigating a more competitive investment environment, offer insights into the complexities of being a large-scale corporate Bitcoin holder. Key Takeaways Strategy continues to buy Bitcoin but at a reduced pace compared to historical peaks. The primary reasons for the slowdown appear to be a shrinking premium on MSTR stock and increased competition from new institutional investment products like spot BTC ETFs. A lower stock premium makes raising capital via equity less advantageous for funding Bitcoin purchases. Increased competition from other Institutional Bitcoin avenues dilutes the unique value proposition of MSTR stock as a BTC proxy. Despite the slower pace, Strategy’s total holdings exceed 580,000 BTC, representing a significant portion of the total supply. The company’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin as a treasury asset remains strong, but their acquisition methods may adapt to the changing market conditions. Concluding Thoughts: A Maturing Market? Strategy’s adjusted BTC Acquisition pace is perhaps a sign of a maturing market. As Bitcoin becomes more accessible through traditional financial channels, the unique arbitrage opportunity that Strategy capitalized on via its stock premium naturally diminishes. This shift doesn’t invalidate their strategy but rather reflects the changing dynamics of institutional adoption and investment access. Their journey from being an outlier to a benchmark for corporate Bitcoin strategy highlights the evolving perception and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. While the road ahead involves navigating new competitive pressures and funding realities, Strategy’s colossal Bitcoin stack ensures they remain a central figure in the narrative of institutional cryptocurrency adoption.

Trader James Wynn, who has become especially popular with his on-chain transactions, earned $87 million in 70 days on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Hyperliquid. However, the unfortunate cryptocurrency whale lost almost all of it in the last 5 days. In his previous trades, it was reported that Wynn made a profit of $65.2 million from PEPE transactions.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) remains pinned below the breakout level of $109,588, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Bitfinex analysts said in a market note that profit-taking generally follows after Bitcoin hits a new all-time high after a sharp rally. The report added that a mild retracement or consolidation would be healthy and lay the foundation for the next leg higher. Glassnode had a similar view. In its latest report, the market intelligence company said that the relative strength indicator (RSI) has weakened, suggesting easing momentum , which could lead to “a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.” Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 Even if a correction happens, dips are likely to be purchased. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan remains bullish as Bitcoin continues to trade above $100,000, and the whales are accumulating. He expects Bitcoin to find support near the $94,000 level. What are the critical levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin’s failure to maintain above the $109,588 level may have attracted selling by short-term traders. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000. Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls. Ether price prediction Buyers could not push Ether ( ETH ) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000 and later to the pattern target of $3,153. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($2,467). The failure of a bullish setup may trap the aggressive bulls, sinking the pair to $2,323 and below that to $2,111. XRP price prediction XRP ( XRP ) has been trading between the moving averages, indicating a lack of aggressive buying or selling. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattish 20-day EMA ($2.33) and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price dips below the 50-day SMA ($2.24), the XRP/USDT pair could dive to the $2 support. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61. On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA opens the gates for a rally to $2.65. Buyers will have to drive the pair above $2.65 to catapult the price to $3. BNB price prediction Buyers pushed BNB ( BNB ) above the $693 resistance on May 27 but could not sustain the higher levels. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The price action of the past few days has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $693. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could rally toward the pattern target of $752. The 20-day EMA ($658) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could accelerate selling as the aggressive bulls may cover their positions. That could tug the pair to the 50-day SMA ($622). Solana price prediction Solana ( SOL ) has been consolidating inside a narrow range between the 20-day EMA ($169) and the overhead resistance at $180. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The SOL/USDT pair could descend to $159 and later to the 50-day SMA ($153), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the pair could swing between $153 and $180 for some time. A break and close above $180 signals the resumption of the up move. The pair could pick up momentum and rally to the $210 to $220 resistance zone. Dogecoin price prediction Sellers are trying to pull Dogecoin ( DOGE ) below the immediate support at the 20-day EMA ($0.22). DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the horizontal support at $0.21. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.21 level with all their might because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($0.19). Such a move brings the large $0.14 to $0.26 range into play. On the contrary, a rebound off $0.21 suggests the bulls are vigorously defending the level. That could keep the pair inside the $0.21 to $0.26 range for a few more days. Cardano price prediction Buyers have managed to keep Cardano ( ADA ) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern, but the bounce lacks strength. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView That increases the risk of a break below the 50-day SMA ($0.70). If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to the solid support at $0.60. That suggests the markets have rejected the breakout from the bullish setup. Buyers will have to push the price above the $0.86 resistance to indicate the resumption of the up move. The pair may then rally to $1.01, where the bears may mount a strong defense. Related: SUI price chart hints at 2x rally amid Nasdaq ETF filing Sui price prediction Sui ( SUI ) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($3.66) on May 28, indicating that the sentiment remains negative and the traders are selling on rallies. SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bears will try to sink the SUI/USDT pair to the 50-day SMA ($3.24), which is a key level to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to clear the 20-day EMA hurdle. If they can pull it off, the pair may rally to the $3.90 to $4.25 overhead zone. On the other hand, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests that the bears remain in control. The pair could then plunge to the $2.86 support. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid (HYPE) turned down from $40 on May 26 and broke below the breakout level of $35.73 on May 28. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView There is support at $32, but if the level cracks, the HYPE/USDT pair could extend the slide to the 20-day EMA ($30). Buyers will try to start a bounce off the 20-day EMA but may face stiff resistance at $35.73. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above $35.73. That suggests solid demand at lower levels. The bulls will then make one more attempt to drive the pair to the overhead resistance of $42.25. Chainlink price prediction Chainlink ( LINK ) continues to find support at the neckline of the H&S pattern, but the bulls have failed to start a strong rebound. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($15.66) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. Buyers will have to push the price above $18 to gain the upper hand. If they do that, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $19.80. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($14.68), it suggests that the markets have rejected the breakout above the resistance line. The pair could then drop to $13.20.

2025-05-28T19:36:07.000Z,"New Tension in US-China Trade War: Trump Issues Strong Order","US President Donald Trump has taken a new step in a bid to limit China’s capacity to manufacture advanced chips. The Trump administration has ordered American companies that develop software used to design semiconductors to stop selling those services to Chinese groups. According to sources familiar with the matter, the US Department of Commerce has told companies such as Cadence, Synopsys and Siemens EDA, which produce Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software, to end their sales to China. This decision was conveyed in official letters sent by the Bureau of Industry and Security responsible for Export Control within the department. However, it is not yet clear whether all EDA companies have received such letters. The move is seen as the Trump administration’s latest effort to curb China’s ability to produce AI chips. In April, the U.S. also restricted exports of Nvidia’s AI chips, which it developed specifically for China.

About 80 percent of the Chinese EDA market is controlled by Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Siemens EDA.

2025-05-28T19:30:05.000Z,"Old Bitcoin Wakes Up As 1y–5y Holder Activity Spikes – What Are LTH Signaling?","After reaching a new all-time high of $112,000, Bitcoin is now consolidating just below this level, holding strong above the key $106,000 support zone. Despite short-term resistance, the broader structure remains bullish, with analysts expecting an impulsive move once BTC reclaims higher ground. With global markets facing heightened economic uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to show resilience, thriving as a hedge and outperforming traditional risk assets. Market sentiment remains positive as on-chain signals strengthen the bullish outlook. According to new data from Glassnode, spending by older Bitcoin holders is heating up once again. Aggregate transaction volume from the 1-year to 5-year holding cohorts has surged to $4.02 billion, marking the highest level since February. This uptick in long-term holder activity often precedes major market shifts, as veteran participants begin to reposition. While some view this as potential profit-taking, it also signals renewed confidence and market engagement from experienced holders. As BTC consolidates near record highs, this behavior could reflect long-term investors preparing for broader market participation in the next leg up. Bitcoin Faces Pivotal Test as Long-Term Holders Move Billions Bitcoin is facing a critical moment as it consolidates just below its all-time high near $112,000. After rallying more than 50% since its April low, BTC now needs to hold above the $106K–$108K zone and decisively push past the $112K level to confirm a new bullish impulse. The coming days are likely to set the tone for the next leg of this cycle. Macroeconomic tensions are intensifying, with US and Japanese treasury yields flashing signs of systemic stress. In this climate, Bitcoin appears to be thriving as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Its non-sovereign, decentralized nature continues to attract capital in times of uncertainty, and the recent price action suggests that trend is gaining strength. On-chain data from Glassnode adds further depth to the picture. Spending by older Bitcoin holders—those in the 1–5 year cohort—has surged, with aggregate volume reaching $4.02 billion, the highest since February. The breakdown reveals notable outflows from long-term wallets: 3–5 year cohort: $2.16B (second-largest this cycle, behind March 2024’s $6B) 2–3 year cohort: $1.41B 1–2 year cohort: $450M This marks the fifth-largest 1–5 year spending spike of the current cycle, driven primarily by holders with three or more years of holding time. While some interpret this as profit-taking, it may also signal conviction among experienced participants rotating capital or positioning for further gains. With technical support holding and liquidity steadily returning, Bitcoin is on the verge of what could be a major breakout. A clean move above $112K with volume would validate the next phase of the bull market—and potentially open the door to $120K and beyond. BTC Consolidates Below ATH As Bulls Defend Key Levels Bitcoin is trading at $108,858 on the daily chart, consolidating just below its recent all-time high of $112,000. Price action shows that BTC is holding above the previous resistance zone turned support near $103,600, a level that provided the base for May’s breakout. The market structure remains bullish, with Bitcoin printing a series of higher highs and higher lows since its April bottom. The 34 EMA (green) at $102,277 and the 50 SMA (blue) at $96,844 are both trending upward, reinforcing a strong medium-term uptrend. These moving averages now act as dynamic support in the event of any pullbacks. Volume has slightly decreased during this consolidation, which is typical after a strong impulse move, suggesting that the market is pausing before its next major decision. To resume the bullish trend, BTC needs to close convincingly above the $112K mark. A breakout with strong volume could open the door to a rapid move toward $120K and beyond. On the downside, maintaining support above $103,600 is crucial to avoid a deeper retracement.

2025-05-28T19:29:14.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Sees Sharp Correction: Analysis Firm Shares Its Expectations for the Future","NYDIG, one of the leading financial services companies in the cryptocurrency markets, evaluated Bitcoin's recent rally and market indicators in its report this week. The firm noted that Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $112,000 last week, coinciding with turbulence in traditional markets. The rally also surpassed the previous peak of $109,358 set in January. The report recalled that Bitcoin experienced a sharp correction of 28.2% before reaching this level, falling to $ 74,400 after Trump's “Freedom Day” when he began to impose tariffs. However, according to NYDIG, these corrections are a natural part of the uptrend that started at $ 15,460 in November 2022. Interestingly, NYDIG data suggests that this cycle has been less volatile than previous Bitcoin bull markets. The current cycle has seen losses of 10% or more only seven times, compared to 13 and 10 in the previous two cycles, respectively. What’s more, these declines have been both more frequent and deeper.

Pointing out that Bitcoin has increased 7.1 times compared to closing prices (7.2 times compared to the current high price) since the $ 15,450 bottom seen in November 2022, NYDIG states that a repeat of the 20-fold increases in past cycles is not expected, but there is still significant upside potential. The report noted that perpetual swap and forward rates, which are indicators of speculative activity, are currently well below historical levels, suggesting that the current rally is not fueled by excessive speculation. Additionally, the MVRV ratio currently stands at 2.4x, which is low compared to past cycles. NYDIG notes that this indicator has peaked at 4.0x in previous cycles, but with each new cycle these peaks have trended downward. NYDIG analyzes the coefficients of the rise from bottom to top, indicating that there is still significant upside potential for Bitcoin across possible price scenarios. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738.

Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61.On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA opens the gates for a rally to $2.65.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5.

This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved.

David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets. At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.”The FCA also noted it will work with the UK’s central bank to regulate stablecoins. Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said, “For those stablecoins that expect to operate at systemic scale, the Bank of England will publish a complementary consultation paper later this year.”Related: UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini reportEnsuring stablecoins remain stableThe FCA said that its rules “aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value.” The regulator said customers must be clearly informed about how the backing assets are managed. It also recommended that stablecoin issuers appoint independent third-party custodians to hold reserve assets:“We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency, irrespective of the value of the backing assets portfolio, with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.“Breeden added that the FCA’s proposals are part of a broader effort to build the UK’s stablecoin regime.Related: UK to require crypto firms to report every customer transactionCrypto custody rules incomingThe FCA’s proposals also introduce new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services, as outlined in a separate discussion paper. The rules are designed to ensure that user assets are secure and can be accessed at any time:“The FCA's proposals would require firms providing crypto custody services, who have responsibility for keeping consumers’ crypto safe, to ensure they are effectively secured and can be easily accessed at any time.“Proposed measures also aim to reduce both the likelihood and impact of crypto firms failing, both in the crypto custody and stablecoin sectors.

2025-05-28T13:19:41.000Z,"NFT monthly sales break 2025 downward trend in May: CryptoSlam","Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) caught an uptick in monthly sales in May after months of consistent decline throughout 2025. Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT monthly sales.

The number of users buying NFTs rose by 50% to over 936,000 in May, up from around 622,000 in April.May’s figures are the largest buyer count since October 2024, hinting at growing investor participation during the month. While buyers increased, the number of unique sellers continued to decline. In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers.

The analyst believes real-world assets (RWAs) linking with NFTs could reignite the lending sector of digital collectibles. RWA NFTs also showed potential earlier this year.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42.

2025-05-28T09:59:06.000Z,"Fungible cryptos in secondary sales are not securities, Ripple tells SEC","Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP, argued that fungible cryptocurrencies are not securities when transferred in secondary transactions in a recent letter sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In its May 27 letter, Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation.

He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.

Still, it would be inaccurate to suggest Bitcoin has decoupled from traditional markets; its 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has remained above 70% over the past four weeks. As such, if equities enter a bear market, Bitcoin is likely to face downside as well.30-day correlation: Bitcoin/USD vs. S&P 500 futures.

While macroeconomic trends and correlations with traditional assets still matter, Bitcoin is increasingly being framed as a strategic asset with utility beyond speculation. As such, its performance could diverge, at least partially, from that of equities, especially as adoption broadens among influential companies and investors.While the stock market may remain sensitive to macro data and earnings surprises, Bitcoin’s upside potential appears to rest on a mix of monetary policy, institutional positioning, and its emerging role as a hedge against systemic financial risk.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
