The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As the Ethereum price targets $4,000, a new DeFi coin is catching the attention of Cardano holders. Discover how this AI-powered crypto is shaking up the crypto sector. Table of Contents Expert predicts ETH surge to $4,000 amid bullish signals Cardano forming symmetrical triangle How Unilabs is reimagining passive crypto income Unilabs rises as the leading DeFi project in the market The Ethereum price is expected to push toward the $4,000 mark in the coming days based on bullish technical indicators. Besides, AshCryptoReal noted that a second doji candlestick has formed on the chart, pointing at an uptrend. While ETH eyes a rally, Cardano holders are shifting to a new project because of its potential. Meet Unilabs, the AI-powered platform that is expected to transform the $120 billion DeFi market. Expert predicts ETH surge to $4,000 amid bullish signals The Ethereum price ( ETH ) may be on the verge of a major rally, according to crypto expert AshCryptoReal, who boldly declared on X, “SEND $ETH TO $4,000.” Backing his prediction with technical indicators, AshCryptoReal points out that the appearance of a second consecutive doji candle suggests that the uptrend has the potential to continue. Some key factors are aligning to support a move toward the $4,000 level within the next 4–6 weeks. The RSI and MACD signal renewed strength in the Ethereum price momentum. AshCryptoReal has pointed to Bitcoin’s performance as the most pivotal catalyst. If Bitcoin breaks its ATH, it could set off a wave of bullish sentiment that lifts all major altcoins, including the Ethereum price. Coupled with macroeconomic factors, ETH may surpass the $4,000 mark. ETH has profits of 38.3% on the monthly chart. Cardano forming symmetrical triangle The Cardano price ( ADA ) is still trading below the $1 mark despite the little uptick on the weekly chart. According to CoinMarketCap, ADA rose by 3.3% over seven days and currently hovers between $0.72 and $0.77. Looking ahead, Sssebi expects Cardano to skyrocket to $0.84 and even $1. According to them, the cryptocurrency is currently forming a symmetrical triangle with a potential breakout in the near term. In addition, Leader Alpha believes ADA shows one of the biggest bull flags. According to analysts, ADA is likely to jump over a major trend resistance in mid-June. When this happens, Leader Alpha believes ADA might form a big God candle which may push it up the chart. Investor confidence has risen to 71%, making it more likely that a Cardano ETF gets approval. An approval could push Cardano’s price to a record high.

This project is a passive income-generating opportunity for users who want to capitalize on the $120 billion DeFi market. Simply put, Unilabs is a DeFi project for those who want to participate in the best crypto investments without being glued to price charts and market trends. At the core of its offering is a set of four AI-optimized investment funds (AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund) each tailored to different risk appetites. Meanwhile, Unilabs has a unified yield engine, which redistributes profits from all strategies into a shared profit pool, allowing users to benefit across market verticals and not just one. Unlike top DeFi projects that rely solely on staking, Unilabs offers “multi-source yield,” a combination of arbitrage profits, staking rewards, mining returns, and algorithmic fund rebalancing. This blend mimics hedge fund logic, now made accessible to everyday users via one token: UNIL. Currently in the crypto ICO stage and trading at $0.0051, with over $1.27 million raised, the platform is drawing attention. If Unilabs reaches a $75 million market cap, the DeFi token could hit $0.025, offering early buyers a 5x return. With 30% of all fees redistributed and AI doing the heavy lifting, Unilabs could be the next income machine for the future. Unilabs rises as the leading DeFi project in the market As ETH builds momentum, Cardano holders are diversifying to new DeFi projects that offer more utility and earning opportunities. Unilabs is one of the fastest-growing crypto ICOs in the market and has the potential to outshine even top altcoins like ADA. Those who want to benefit from this new revolution have to join the presale early before it launches. To learn more about UNIL, visit the website and Telegram.

2025-05-29T06:46:46.000Z,"Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Takes Bullish Stance As It Eyes $0.8 Can It Reach $1 Before June?","The post Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Takes Bullish Stance As It Eyes $0.8 Can It Reach $1 Before June? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano is on the move, with an uptrend positioning ADA to hit $1 soon. With fresh tech, strong on-chain activity, and bullish sentiment building, the stage is set. The question now is simple: can ADA hit the fabled $1 mark before June ends? Let’s find out. Inside Cardano’s Latest Progress Cardano’s been busy. It’s now in its Voltaire governance phase, where decisions about upgrades, spending, and protocol changes are now on-chain, made by ADA holders. Founder Charles Hoskinson also recently stated that Cardano could be the first blockchain to launch a privacy stablecoin. That comes alongside a recent integration with Brave Browser. There’s more on the way too. The upcoming Leios upgrade, due sometime over the next year, is set to boost Cardano’s transactions per second to 11,000 and improve how developers create programmable currencies. Cardano is now expanding into Bitcoin territory, with the Lace wallet adding Bitcoin support to open up cross-chain DeFi options. Source: TapTools This tech progress is matched by a surge in activity. According to TapTools , daily transactions jumped to 50,000 in May, and developers logged 21,258 GitHub commits, putting Cardano ahead of Ethereum this year. It’s clear Cardano’s steady approach is paying off, with the token now up over 65% in the past year, at $0.76 as of May 28th . So do Cardano price predictions think it can reach $1 before June? Cardano Price Prediction: $1 Is In Sight ADA has recently recovered after pulling back from its March highs of around $1.14. A sharp tumble in April sent the token to $0.52, and after topping $0.84 in mid-May, it’s now bouncing between $0.72 and $0.83. In late May, it’s been finding resistance at the $0.77 mark, with $0.80 now the next key level to challenge. It’s held firm, and a breakout could be around the corner. If ADA clears $0.80, analysts are watching $0.85 as the next key level. Get past that, and it’s likely to quickly head toward $0.90 or possibly $1.00 according to CoinDCX , especially if market sentiment stays positive. But $1.00 before June seems unlikely without a significant catalyst. Still, Cardano price predictions for June are positive. If bulls stay in charge, ADA could close June around $1.10–$1.30. That’s not guaranteed, but it’s not out of reach either. The volume’s there, and ADA has held up well, trending higher since its April low. For now, the price action is coiling. The setup’s strong and ADA only needs a spark to explode. Keep an eye on that $0.80 level: that’s where things could get interesting. Remittix steps Up With a $15.4+ Million Raise Cardano looks bullish, but that hasn’t stopped investors from diversifying into the Remittix presale. Remittix is developing a new way to turn crypto into real-world money fast. It allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send the funds straight to any global bank account with a flat fee and instant settlement.

They’ve also revealed the first look at the Remittix Wallet, built for simplicity and speed, with beta testing set for Q3 2025. For businesses, Remittix Pay API opens the door to accepting crypto payments and settling them in fiat automatically. $15.4+ million has been raised so far, smart contracts are in place, and regulatory progress is steaming ahead. At $0.0781 right now, the RTX token is one to watch carefully. Watch Out for ADA and RTX ADA’s momentum is building, and all eyes are on the $1 mark. While it might not be reached by the start of June, it’s a viable target in the month ahead. Meanwhile, Remittix looks strong. There’s an active team building to disrupt the $194 trillion cross-border payments market, backed by thousands of investors. Both might just be June’s most bullish plays.

2025-05-29T06:40:23.000Z,"Dogecoin ETF: 21Shares Files Historic Application for Spot Crypto Investment","BitcoinWorld Dogecoin ETF: 21Shares Files Historic Application for Spot Crypto Investment Get ready, crypto enthusiasts! The world of digital assets just got another interesting development that could potentially shake things up, especially for fans of the popular meme coin. According to a report by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared on X, 21Shares , a well-known player in the crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) space, has officially filed an application to launch a spot Dogecoin ETF in the United States. This move is a significant signal of the continued interest in expanding Crypto Investment products into mainstream financial markets. Understanding the Buzz: What is a Spot Dogecoin ETF? Before we dive deeper into why this filing is making waves, let’s quickly clarify what a spot ETF is, especially in the context of cryptocurrency. Think of an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) like a basket of assets you can buy and sell on traditional stock exchanges. A Spot Crypto ETF , specifically, holds the actual underlying cryptocurrency – in this case, Dogecoin – directly. This is different from a futures ETF, which holds contracts speculating on the future price of the asset, not the asset itself. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Spot Dogecoin ETF Dogecoin Futures ETF Underlying Asset Actual Dogecoin (DOGE) Contracts speculating on Dogecoin’s future price Price Tracking Aims to track the current market price of Dogecoin closely May deviate from the spot price due to futures market dynamics Investor Exposure Direct exposure to Dogecoin’s current price movements Indirect exposure via derivatives Custody The ETF provider holds the actual Dogecoin securely Holds futures contracts, no direct Dogecoin custody needed by the fund The key takeaway is that a spot Dogecoin ETF would offer investors a way to gain exposure to the direct price movements of Dogecoin without needing to buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. This is particularly appealing to traditional investors who are more comfortable with brokerage accounts and regulated financial products. Who is 21Shares and Why Does Their Filing Matter? 21Shares is not new to the world of crypto investment products. They are actually one of the largest issuers of crypto ETPs globally, with a range of products tracking various cryptocurrencies available on European exchanges. Their experience in creating and managing regulated crypto financial products lends significant weight to their application for a Dogecoin ETF in the potentially lucrative, but often challenging, U.S. market. Their filing isn’t just another application; it’s a strategic move from a prominent player. Having successfully launched numerous crypto ETPs in other jurisdictions, 21Shares brings expertise in compliance, custody, and product structuring that is crucial for navigating the stringent requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing signals their confidence not only in the future of Crypto Investment but specifically in the potential for Dogecoin as an investable asset class for a broader audience. The Journey Towards a Spot Crypto ETF in the U.S. The path to getting a Spot Crypto ETF approved in the United States has been a long and winding one. For years, the SEC had expressed concerns primarily related to market manipulation and investor protection in the underlying spot crypto markets. However, the landscape shifted dramatically with the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs set a precedent. It demonstrated that the SEC is now seemingly more comfortable with the structure and surveillance mechanisms proposed by issuers for spot crypto products. This paved the way for applications for other cryptocurrencies. While Ethereum spot ETFs are currently undergoing the review process, 21Shares’ move to file for a Dogecoin ETF shows that issuers are now looking beyond the top two cryptocurrencies, indicating growing maturity and acceptance of the broader digital asset class within traditional finance. Why a Dogecoin ETF? Exploring the Rationale Some might find it surprising that a meme coin like Dogecoin is now the subject of a spot ETF filing by a major issuer like 21Shares . However, Dogecoin has a few unique characteristics that make it a candidate, albeit a controversial one, for such a product: Brand Recognition: Dogecoin has massive brand recognition, largely due to its community and high-profile endorsements (like Elon Musk). This makes it instantly recognizable to potential investors. Liquidity: Despite its origins, Dogecoin is one of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, traded on numerous exchanges globally. Liquidity is a key factor for ETF products. Market Cap: Dogecoin consistently ranks among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, indicating significant investor interest and market presence. While its fundamentals differ significantly from Bitcoin or Ethereum, its popularity and market presence make it a potential target for products aimed at capturing retail investor interest within a regulated framework. This filing is a bet by 21Shares on the enduring appeal and market viability of Dogecoin as part of the expanding universe of Crypto Investment options. What Could a Spot Dogecoin ETF Mean for Dogecoin Price and Investors? The potential approval of a Dogecoin ETF could have several significant implications, particularly for the Dogecoin Price and how people access this asset. Potential Benefits: Increased Accessibility: Millions of investors who prefer using traditional brokerage accounts could easily add Dogecoin exposure to their portfolios without dealing with crypto exchanges, wallets, or private keys. Enhanced Legitimacy: An SEC-approved ETF could lend an air of legitimacy to Dogecoin as an asset class, potentially attracting more conservative investors. Potential Demand Increase: If an ETF is approved and gains traction, the issuer would need to buy actual Dogecoin on the spot market to back the fund’s shares. This consistent buying pressure could positively impact the Dogecoin Price . Professional Custody: The ETF would handle the secure storage of the underlying Dogecoin, removing a significant hurdle and risk for individual investors. Potential Challenges and Risks: Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, approval for altcoins like Dogecoin is not guaranteed. The SEC might have specific concerns related to Dogecoin’s concentration, market structure, or meme-driven volatility. Market Volatility: Dogecoin is known for its extreme price swings. An ETF would not cushion investors from this inherent volatility; they would still be exposed to significant potential losses. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which would be an ongoing cost for investors compared to holding Dogecoin directly. Dilution of Direct Ownership: Investing via an ETF means owning shares in a fund that owns Dogecoin, not owning the Dogecoin directly. This means you cannot use the Dogecoin for transactions, staking (if applicable in the future), or other on-chain activities. The impact on Dogecoin Price is a subject of much speculation. While increased demand from an ETF could be bullish, the overall market sentiment, regulatory hurdles, and Dogecoin’s own supply dynamics will also play crucial roles. It’s essential for investors to consider these factors carefully. Broader Implications for the Spot Crypto ETF and Crypto Investment Landscape The 21Shares filing for a Dogecoin ETF is more than just a story about a single meme coin; it’s indicative of a larger trend in the financial world. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has clearly emboldened issuers to explore offering similar products for a wider range of digital assets. This signals a maturing Spot Crypto ETF market and a growing appetite from traditional finance to package and sell crypto exposure to a broader investor base. This development could potentially pave the way for ETFs tracking other altcoins in the future, assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared and sufficient market interest exists. It represents a significant step in the convergence of traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem, making Crypto Investment more accessible, albeit through different avenues than direct ownership. Expert Insights on the Dogecoin ETF Filing As mentioned by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this filing is a notable event. Analysts are closely watching how the SEC will approach altcoin spot ETF applications following the Bitcoin approvals. The unique nature of Dogecoin might present specific challenges or require different considerations from regulators compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. The filing itself, however, confirms that major financial product issuers see potential demand for a wide array of Crypto Investment vehicles. What’s Next for the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF Application? Now that the application is filed, it will undergo a review process by the SEC. This process can take several months, involving periods for public comment, potential amendments to the filing, and ultimately, a decision to approve, deny, or delay. There is no guarantee of approval, and the outcome will likely depend on how well 21Shares addresses the SEC’s concerns, particularly those specific to the Dogecoin market. Conclusion: A New Era for Dogecoin and Spot Crypto ETFs? The filing by 21Shares for a spot Dogecoin ETF marks a significant moment in the evolution of Crypto Investment products. It highlights the increasing institutional interest in bringing digital assets, even those that started as internet jokes, into regulated financial frameworks. While the approval is far from certain, the filing itself validates Dogecoin’s enduring market presence and signals a potential expansion of the Spot Crypto ETF market beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Whether this leads to increased adoption and positively impacts the Dogecoin Price remains to be seen, but it undeniably opens up a new avenue for traditional investors to potentially gain exposure to the world of meme coins.

2025-05-29T06:38:30.000Z,"Pakistan confirms plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve","Pakistan will create a strategic Bitcoin reserve as part of a government-led initiative to embrace digital assets. During his appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the newly established Pakistan Crypto Council, said the government is setting up a national Bitcoin wallet to hold reserves long term. He clarified that the initiative is not driven by market speculation but by a broader state strategy, adding that the government will “never, ever sell” the Bitcoin it acquires. Pakistan’s decision marks a clear break from past skepticism . Saqib said the move was directly inspired by the United States’ decision to establish its own Bitcoin reserve, noting that Pakistan intends to follow a similar path in embracing blockchain-based financial infrastructure. While the size of Pakistan’s intended Bitcoin holdings remains unspecified, the government has made clear its intent to acquire and retain the asset. It is still unclear whether the BTC will be purchased directly or obtained through other channels. The announcement comes alongside a broader push to integrate blockchain technologies into the country’s public and economic systems. You might also like: Texas approves Bitcoin reserve bill, awaits governor’s signature Saqib also confirmed plans to allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity toward Bitcoin mining operations and AI data centers, an initiative intended to generate revenue, create jobs, and attract foreign investment. Officials view this as a productive use of otherwise stranded energy and a path to modernize the power sector. As previously reported by crypto.news, Pakistan recently disclosed plans to establish the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), a regulatory body approved by the Ministry of Finance to oversee the country’s digital asset sector. The PDAA would be tasked with licensing and monitoring crypto exchanges, custodians, tokenization platforms, and related services, forming the backbone of Pakistan’s digital finance strategy. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has described the agency as central to placing Pakistan “at the forefront of financial innovation.” Beyond market oversight, the PDAA will also explore tokenizing state assets, enabling blockchain-based debt issuance, and guiding the development of decentralized finance infrastructure. Saqib’s Pakistan Crypto Council has been closely involved in shaping these reforms. Established earlier this year, the Council has engaged with international stakeholders , including Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who now serves as a strategic advisor on blockchain infrastructure and regulatory development.

Many of them called out the analytics platform for not respecting Saylor’s wishes and making the information available for social engineering hackers to exploit. “If Saylor doesn’t want it revealed, and u reveal isn’t that violation of privacy,” said one user. “You literally missed the ENTIRE point of his reply.

The company recently purchased 4,020 BTC at a price of $427.1 million on May 26. Most recently on May 27, Saylor refused to disclose Strategy’s on-chain addresses. He believed that revealing them to the public would pose a security risk, as it simultaneously jeopardizes various stakeholders: the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges, and the investors. “It’s like publishing the address and the bank accounts of all your kids and [the] phone numbers of all your kids and then thinking somehow that makes your family better,” said Saylor.

BitSource: YouTube Adams didn’t share details about how a Bitbond would work; however, a March 31 policy brief paper from advocacy group the Bitcoin Policy Institute proposed a model where holders receive an annual interest rate of 1% for 10 years. When the bond matures, holders also receive a percentage of any Bitcoin market gains . At the same time, 90% of the funds raised through the bonds are allocated to government spending, while 10% is used to purchase Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s bond policy brief. Adams again pushes to axe BitLicense Adams also called for repealing New York’s BitLicense program, which the state launched in 2015 and requires crypto businesses to apply for a license with the New York Department of Financial Services and meet strict compliance standards. The BitLicense program has received criticism from the industry , and Adams has also said the measure is too costly with high licensing fees, and is too stringent with its Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures. “You have a mayor who is the crypto mayor, is the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the city of New York, where you won’t be attacked and criminalized,” he said. “Let’s get rid of the Bitcoin license and allow us to have the free flow of Bitcoin in our city.” Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summit USDC stablecoin issuer Circle was one of the first crypto companies to receive a BitLicense; others have since followed, including crypto exchange Coinbase and trading firm Bakkt. Adams has been actively pushing to attract crypto firms to New York City. As part of his most recent effort, Adams told the inaugural New York City Crypto Summit on May 20 that he was creating a digital advisory council to attract jobs and investments. Meanwhile, on May 12, Adams announced financial services company Figure and private equity firms Traction and Scale would be assisting the city in its crypto efforts.

2025-05-29T06:09:53.000Z,"Bitcoin's $95K-$105K Range in Focus as $10B BTC Options Expiry Looms","Bitcoin BTC options worth billions of dollars are set to expire this Friday at 08:00 UTC on Deribit, making the $95,000 to $105,000 range a critical zone for potential volatility and directional cues. At press time, a total of 93,131 bitcoin monthly options contracts, worth over $10 billion, were due for settlement, with 53% being calls and the remainder being puts. A call option represents a bullish bet on the market, while the put option offers insurance against price slides. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC. The open interest distribution is such that a large amount of \""delta\"" exposure is clustered at the $95,000, $100,000 and $105,000 strikes. This means traders holding positions at these strikes have a significant net directional risk to bitcoin's price. Gamma, which measures the sensitivity of options to changes in BTC's price, will peak as the expiration nears. Therefore, price volatility could trigger widespread hedging by both investors and market makers (who are always on the opposite side of investors' trades), further exacerbating price turbulence. \""The largest delta concentration is in Deribit BTC’s May 30 expiry, with $2.8B delta exposure led by strikes at $100K, $105K, and $95K, which has a potential for strong gamma-driven flows into month-end,\"" decentralized crypto trading platform Volmex said in an explainer on X. \""Any move can trigger aggressive dealer hedging, fragile gamma environment! Expect volatility!,\"" Volmex added. At press time, Bitcoin changed hands at $107,700, having reached record highs above $111,000 the previous week, according to CoinDesk data. Deribit's DVOL index, which represents the options-based 30-day implied or expected volatility, continued to decline, suggesting minimal concern over volatility driven by the upcoming expiry. Volmex's annualized one-day implied volatility index ticked slightly higher to 45.4%. That implies a 24-hour price move of 2.37%.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/29/bitcoin-s-usd95k-usd105k-price-range-in-focus-as-usd10b-btc-options-expiry-looms,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T06:07:12.000Z,"Bitcoin $120K ‘epic mic drop’ rally set after US court blocks Trump tariffs","Bitcoin is poised to rally toward $120,000 after a US federal court blocked the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, a crypto analyst says. “The trade court decision was an epic mic drop, and it’s going to intensify momentum behind Bitcoin,” Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph. The US Court of International Trade reportedly blocked Trump from imposing his tariffs on May 28, arguing that he overstepped his authority. Court “blows a hole in trade talks” Hundal said the decision would have a domino effect on Bitcoin’s price and believes “new all-time highs are imminent, and the momentum is largely irreversible at this stage.” Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) current all-time high of $111,970 was reached on May 22, but it has since fallen to trade around $107,750, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is down 3.36% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap The Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed. “It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.” On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers , levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10% . Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified. “The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, rally — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said , “Buy everything round dos.” Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrow Crypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said , “So Trump tariffs are illegal? Does that mean we get green candles all around tomorrow?” Hundal said “a wall of money” is coming into Bitcoin through corporations, spot Bitcoin ETFs and retail. The trading week ending May 23 saw US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) record a total of $2.75 billion in inflows . Related: Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible “The court order has just accelerated that rotation into risk assets across the US and Asia,” Hundal said. He added all data signals “a solid floor for demand on spot Bitcoin and a very solid consensus for $120K in the option markets.” Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered , recently said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins.

At a recent Bitcoin conference 2025, Howells said that he’s preparing a $75 million plan involving tokenizing part of his missing fortune to raise But time is running out. The landfill is now facing closure, and the council still hasn’t granted him access. The Man Who Lost 8,000 Bitcoins James Howells , a British computer expert from Newport, Wales, accidentally threw away a hard drive in 2013. That hard drive, he says, contains the private keys to 8,000 Bitcoins, worth hundreds of millions of dollars today. For years, he’s fought to search the local landfill where he believes the drive is buried, but city officials have refused his requests, citing environmental and safety concerns. New Plan To Recover Lost Bitcoin Now, with the Newport City Council preparing to permanently shut down the landfill, Howells says he’s out of time and patience. Instead of begging for permission again, he plans to raise $75 million by tokenizing 1,675 of the 8,000 lost Bitcoins. These tokens will be sold as ordinals, a type of digital asset stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. James Howells, still chasing his lost 8,000 $BTC in a landfill, has a new plan: Tokenize 1,675 of those coins as ordinals. pic.twitter.com/qp01tZtvHB — TFTC (@TFTC21) May 28, 2025 This chunk represents about 21% of the lost coins, and the funds will go toward buying the landfill outright. “We’ll make them an offer they can’t refuse,” said Howells, clearly determined to take matters into his own hands. Lights, Camera, Landfill Howells’s story is more than just another crypto headline it’s a modern treasure hunt with emotional stakes. Recently, a U.S.-based production company named LEBUL has secured the exclusive rights to turn his journey into a documentary. Filming is expected to take place over the summer, with a release planned for October or November. Howells said he’s “excited” to finally tell the story in his own words. “This is the first time I can show the world exactly what we want to do at the landfill site,” he added. “Once people see this documentary, they won’t think this is a crazy plan—they’ll see it’s very achievable.”",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/james-howells-hasnt-given-up-a-new-75m-plan-to-rescue-his-lost-bitcoin/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","News",cryptocompare

Though it didn’t ban crypto outright, it significantly deterred adoption. That guidance has now been withdrawn.

2025-05-29T06:00:53.000Z,"Pakistan Embraces Bitcoin and Launches Strategic Reserve","Crypto Council head Bilal Bin Saqib credited the United States and Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin leadership as key inspiration for the shift. Pakistan’s pivot was made amid major reforms, including forming a Digital Asset Authority, allocating 2,000 megawatts of energy to crypto mining, and appointing Binance’s CZ as an adviser. Meanwhile, US officials like David Sacks and Vice President JD Vance were also at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, and talked about the growing federal interest in expanding Bitcoin reserves. Vance urged Bitcoiners to stay engaged in the political engagement. Pakistan Sets Up Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Pakistan made a historic shift in its stance on cryptocurrencies, with the announcement of a government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Bilal Bin Saqib, the head of Pakistan’s crypto council, made the announcement during the Bitcoin 2025 conference held in Las Vegas on May 28. The move makes Pakistan one of the growing number of nations embracing crypto, following in the footsteps of the United States under the administration of President Donald Trump. Saqib mentioned this inspiration,and stated that, “Today is a very historic day. Today, I announce the Pakistani government is setting up its own government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and we want to thank the United States of America again because we were inspired by them.” Bilal Bin Saqib at the Bitcoin 2025 conference This announcement is a dramatic departure from Pakistan’s previously hostile stance on cryptocurrencies. Not long ago, the government held firm that digital assets would never be legalized in the country. However, with geopolitical shifts and increasing global momentum toward digital asset adoption, Pakistan quickly reversed its position and is now actively pursuing a pro-crypto agenda. The journey toward this strategic pivot began in February of 2025 when the idea of a National Crypto Council was proposed. The Council was tasked with designing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and encouraging foreign investment. Key initiatives from the Council included leveraging the country’s excess energy to support Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. Pakistan allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus power in May 2025 to support these initiatives. Adding even more credibility to its crypto ambitions, the Council appointed Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao as an adviser in April. Zhao will guide the development of blockchain infrastructure, regulations, and overall digital asset adoption. On April 27, Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) signed a letter of intent with Pakistan to support the country in tokenizing real-world assets and developing decentralized finance (DeFi) products. Additionally, in May 2025, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance also greenlit the creation of a Digital Asset Authority , which is a dedicated body that will oversee crypto regulation and issue licenses to service providers in the digital asset space. US Could Buy More Bitcoin The US could soon inspire even more countries to turn to Bitcoin as the White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks opened the door to the possibility of the United States government buying even more Bitcoin. This could be the case provided it can be done in a way that doesn’t increase the national debt or impose new taxes. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference during a fireside chat with Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss on May 27, Sacks said the government already has the legal framework to expand its Bitcoin holdings—but only if the Commerce or Treasury departments can identify a budget-neutral method to fund such a purchase. Sacks said that while there are no guarantees, the executive order issued on March 6 gives the federal government the authority to create a crypto reserve that includes not only Bitcoin seized through criminal or civil asset forfeiture, but also Bitcoin that can be legally purchased if financed responsibly. The decision to increase the reserve will ultimately rest with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, who would need to find funding from underutilized programs or other existing sources in the federal budget. According to Sacks, the structure is already in place: “The question is, can we get either the Treasury Department or the Commerce Department to get excited about that because if they do and they can figure out how to fund it, they actually do have presidential authorization.” This could signal a potential policy shift toward more proactive Bitcoin acquisition by the US government, depending on internal budgetary decisions. Government Bitcoin holdings (Source: CoinGecko ) The US government currently holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoin, which is worth over $21 billion at current prices. These holdings primarily stem from major seizures, including 69,370 Bitcoin from the Silk Road case in 2020, 51,351 Bitcoin in a follow-up seizure in 2022, and another 94,636 Bitcoin that was confiscated from Bitfinex hacker Ilya Lichtenstein in 2022. In March 2023, the government sold a portion of its holdings—9,861 Bitcoin—for around $215.7 million. The Department of Justice has also been cleared to sell the full 198,109 Bitcoin it holds. JD Vance Urges Bitcoiners to Get Political United States Vice President JD Vance also delivered a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, and called on the Bitcoin community to stay politically engaged and proactive. He placed a lot of emphasis on the growing importance of Bitcoin on a geopolitical level, and urged Bitcoiners to leverage their political momentum from 2024 and carry it forward into future election cycles as political forces will inevitably impact the future of transformative technologies like Bitcoin. JD Vance at Bitcoin 2024 “What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we do not make the right decisions,” Vance said, stressing that the crypto industry can no longer afford to stay on the political sidelines. He added, “Politics is not going to ignore this community, not now, and not in the future.” Bitcoin quickly gained a lot of institutional credibility and is increasingly being seen as a macroeconomic and strategic asset on the global stage. With sovereign powers engaging in what analysts describe as a geopolitical race to acquire BTC, the digital currency is now recognized as more than just a speculative investment—it is a matter of national interest. Bitcoin advocates argue that countries failing to accumulate BTC may find themselves at a huge disadvantage as its scarcity and store-of-value properties become more widely appreciated. The shift in sentiment was amplified by the pro-crypto stance of President Donald Trump, whose administration established a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a crypto advisory council. These moves set a precedent that influenced other governments to rethink their own digital asset strategies. India , for example, is now reassessing its crypto policies, with Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth acknowledging that digital assets operate beyond national borders and require new approaches to regulation.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9354/pakistan-embraces-bitcoin-and-launches-strategic-reserve,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T06:00:25.000Z,"Bitcoin Up 15% in a Month, Analyst Cautions on MVRV Resistance Level","Bitcoin is currently trading at $109,000, marking a marginal decline of 0.6% over the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term dip, the broader market trend remains intact, with Bitcoin recording an approximate 15% gain over the past month. This performance comes after BTC set a new all-time high just above the $111,000 mark a few days ago, continuing its strong upward momentum through Q2 2025. Burak Kesmeci, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, recently discussed the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio in his latest analysis, “Bitcoin MVRV: Will the Long-Term Downtrend Break This Time?” The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value, effectively measuring holders’ profitability and offering insights into market sentiment and potential turning points. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Above $109K as Long-Term Holders Accumulate Amid Liquidations MVRV Ratio Approaches Crucial Resistance In his analysis, Kesmeci highlighted the importance of the 365-day Simple Moving Average (SMA365) as a benchmark for the MVRV metric. Historically, when Bitcoin’s MVRV crosses above and maintains weekly closes over the SMA365, it typically signals sustained upward momentum. Kesmeci provided the example from April 2025, when the MVRV ratio exceeded the SMA365, corresponding with Bitcoin’s substantial price increase from around $94,000 to $111,000, subsequently setting a new record high. Currently, the MVRV stands at 2.36, comfortably above the SMA365 level of 2.14. However, the analyst points out a significant resistance looming at 2.93, a critical historical level where previous rallies encountered headwinds. The upcoming test at this resistance could indicate whether Bitcoin will sustain its upward trajectory or experience a period of stabilization or correction. Kesmeci emphasized caution, suggesting that traders carefully monitor the MVRV behavior, as approaching these levels often prompts market participants to reassess risk. Bitcoin Retail Investors Remain Cautiously Absent Another factor shaping Bitcoin’s market conditions is the noticeable lack of retail investor engagement. Kesmeci observed that despite Bitcoin achieving new record highs in the second quarter of 2025, retail investor participation, measured by transfer volumes in smaller denominations (under $10,000), remains relatively subdued. While Bitcoin’s price trajectory has remained robust, retail volumes have seen minimal increases, indicating the current rally is primarily driven by institutional or large-scale investors. Historically, retail investor participation has served as an essential driver for sustained bull markets, amplifying price movements initially propelled by institutional investments. Related Reading: US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief Kesmeci notes that past major rallies, such as the one observed in 2020-2021, gained significant momentum when retail investors actively joined in. Thus, a critical aspect moving forward will be monitoring retail activity. Any uptick in retail investment could potentially catalyze further Bitcoin appreciation, reinforcing recent gains and setting the stage for a broader market rally.

The move extends its impressive recovery, with Ethereum ( ETH ) now up 53% over the past month after a rough Q1 that saw prices drop more than 45%. A major driver behind the rally appears to be growing institutional interest. U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds have attracted $402 million in inflows over the past month, according to SoSoValue data . BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust alone brought in $53 million in the past 24 hours, pushing its cumulative inflows to $4.3 billion. Some industry leaders are now pushing for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve staking for Ethereum ETFs. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce recently clarified that Ethereum’s proof-of-stake functions, such as node operations and validation, are not considered securities. If ETF staking requests from companies like 21Shares are approved, more inflows could follow. The trend is further highlighted by the large-scale ETH purchases made by institutions. Over 350,000 Ethereum, worth about $837 million, were purchased by Abraxas Capital between May 7 and May 21. In addition, the company pulled 185,000 ETH from exchanges during a 44% price increase at the beginning of May, demonstrating long-term conviction.

The news sent its stock soaring 400%, and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin joined the company’s board. On the daily chart, Ethereum is currently displaying bullish momentum as it tests the upper Bollinger Band. The price is still above the $2,573 20-day simple moving average, which has served as a crucial support level for the rally. ETH is forming a rising wedge pattern, which could indicate continuation if it breaks above the $2,800 resistance. ETH price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The 50-day and 100-day EMAs, as well as the majority of other significant moving averages, are flashing buy signals. The relative strength index, which is at 71.5, indicates that ETH may be approaching overbought territory. A brief pause or pullback may result from this, particularly as the market gets closer to the psychological $2,800 and $3,000 levels. Ethereum may retest support at $2,650 or the 20-day SMA at $2,573 if it is unable to maintain above $2,700. However, a breakout above $2,800 could result in $2,900 and higher if momentum continues.

Taking to social media, Xena sought to provide context to her earlier statements, emphasizing both the significance of such a price movement and the broader outlook for the digital asset. In her post, Xena acknowledged that moving from sub-dollar levels to $8 would represent a notable milestone for XRP. She emphasized that many investors, particularly those who have held the asset for years, would experience meaningful gains if this target were reached. However, she also stressed that not everyone would consider $8 to be a final destination, especially those who are waiting for much higher valuations. “For many of you, that would be life-changing,” she wrote. “While others would have to wait for higher levels, but with the confidence, it’s finally getting somewhere.” Her message pointed to the varied expectations within the XRP community, highlighting that gains are relative depending on entry point and investment horizon. Y'all have a way to write articles and sometimes I don't quite get it lol This one is about me and what I said about $8 XRP for this year. I want to be very clear : from cents to $8 would be a great achievement after years spent below a dollar. Many of you would have life… pic.twitter.com/HUj3UW16bw — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) May 27, 2025 A Message for Long-Time Holders and Recent Investors She added that even if XRP were to stabilize at $2, it would still be viewed as a positive outcome for early adopters. “Nobody can tell you XRP was a bad investment because you made money already,” she noted, particularly addressing those who entered the market when the token was priced significantly lower. Xena also spoke candidly about long-time holders who purchased during XRP’s previous all-time high around $3.30 in 2017–2018. She stated that most of those individuals have likely exited the market already, accepting their losses. “But that’s part of the game,” she remarked, suggesting that such volatility is a known and accepted part of crypto investing. Market Movements and Unnatural Price Behavior Addressing recent market turbulence, she reaffirmed her earlier prediction that XRP would not drop below $2. While acknowledging that a temporary dip occurred following tariff-related announcements, she noted that XRP recovered quickly and remained in the $2 range. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 She also alluded to historical concerns over XRP’s price behavior during its past rallies. Referencing an earlier claim by another community member, she said XRP’s previous surge to $3.30 did not appear to be a “natural” move. Without elaborating on the cause, she simply stated, “He was right. I’m just leaving this here,” followed by a general observation about XRP’s tendency to correct after brief rallies. Skepticism Toward Chart-Based Forecasts Xena pushed back against any suggestion that current price levels are being suppressed arbitrarily. “If it wasn’t on purpose, they would have brought this down back at 50 cents already. Believe it,” she wrote, arguing that XRP’s ability to stay above key psychological levels is evidence of underlying strength. Regarding the $8 prediction itself, she clarified that the figure originated from chart-based speculation, not insider information. She attributed the number to an analyst known as Water Above, whose forecast was amplified by another influencer, Bearable Bull. “It’s just a random number based on charts,” she said, urging caution in placing too much faith in projections that rely heavily on Bitcoin’s behavior. Ripple’s Long-Term Commitment and Global Expansion Xena concluded her post by reaffirming her long-term belief in XRP’s potential, pointing out the persistent efforts of Ripple, the company associated with XRP’s development and adoption. While Ripple has spent the past several years battling the SEC in court, she stressed that the company has continued to expand globally. “There is so much they are not talking about,” she added.

The strength of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) run from $75,000 on April 7 to its all-time high just below $112,000 on May 22 “is starting to break down,” Woo wrote to X on May 28. “This week is absolutely critical,” he said. “If we do not get follow-through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” Woo said that in the short term, “late comer speculators” are taking long positions while potential profit taking “is ready to dump” as seen in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is a measure of the price paid divided by the price sold. “This week’s spot buying will strongly influence the next 1-2 months of price action. We are in a pivot zone.” Bitcoin short-term models.

2025-05-29T05:50:34.000Z,"XRP Treasury Strategy: VivoPower Secures $121M for Pioneering Move","BitcoinWorld XRP Treasury Strategy: VivoPower Secures $121M for Pioneering Move Imagine a public company listed on a major stock exchange deciding to put a significant portion of its balance sheet into a volatile digital asset. That’s precisely what VivoPower International (Nasdaq: VVPR) is aiming to do, following a massive $121 million fundraising round. The goal? To launch an ambitious XRP corporate treasury strategy, a move that could position them as pioneers in the world of institutional crypto adoption. What is This VivoPower XRP Treasury Strategy All About? At its core, VivoPower plans to hold XRP , the digital asset associated with Ripple, as a primary component of its corporate treasury reserves. This isn’t just about holding a small amount; the substantial $121 million raised, led by Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud, is specifically earmarked to fund this strategy. The company intends to potentially become the first Nasdaq-listed entity to center its treasury operations around a digital asset like XRP . Traditionally, corporate treasuries hold assets like cash, short-term government bonds, or other low-risk, liquid investments. The idea is to preserve capital and ensure liquidity for operational needs. Shifting towards digital assets like XRP represents a significant departure and signals a strong belief in the future value and utility of cryptocurrencies. Why Choose XRP for Corporate Treasury? The decision to focus on XRP specifically for a corporate treasury strategy is noteworthy. While Bitcoin has gained some traction as a treasury asset among a few companies, XRP presents a different proposition. Supporters often highlight its speed and low transaction costs, features initially designed for facilitating cross-border payments. Factors that might influence a company like VivoPower to consider XRP could include: Potential for Growth: A belief that XRP ‘s value could appreciate significantly over time, offering potentially higher returns than traditional treasury assets. Utility Focus: Interest in leveraging XRP ‘s underlying technology for potential future business applications, especially if the company has international operations or payment needs. Strategic Positioning: Aiming to be at the forefront of digital asset integration within traditional finance structures. Connection to Ripple XRP: While legally distinct, the association with Ripple and its established network might offer perceived advantages or future opportunities. It’s crucial to remember that selecting any digital asset for a treasury involves careful consideration of its unique characteristics, market dynamics, and regulatory status. The Role of Institutional Crypto Adoption and Adam Traidman This move by VivoPower fits into the broader narrative of institutional crypto adoption . More and more traditional companies and financial institutions are exploring ways to engage with digital assets, whether through investment, integrating blockchain technology, or offering crypto-related services. A significant factor bolstering VivoPower’s strategy is the addition of former Ripple executive Adam Traidman, who will serve as chairman of VivoPower’s advisory board. Traidman’s experience within the Ripple XRP ecosystem brings valuable expertise and credibility to VivoPower’s ambitious plan. His involvement suggests a deeper understanding of the asset and its potential applications beyond simple speculation. The presence of experienced figures from the crypto space on corporate boards or advisory committees is becoming increasingly common as companies navigate this new landscape. It helps bridge the gap between traditional corporate governance and the nuances of digital assets. Potential Benefits and Challenges of a VivoPower XRP Treasury Adopting an XRP corporate treasury strategy comes with both potential upsides and considerable risks. VivoPower will need to navigate these carefully. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: If XRP performs well, the treasury holdings could significantly boost the company’s balance sheet value. Inflation Hedge: Some view digital assets as a potential hedge against inflation, though this is a debated topic. Innovation Leader: Positions VivoPower as an innovative company embracing future financial technologies. Attracting Investors: May appeal to investors interested in exposure to digital assets through a publicly traded stock. Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including XRP , are known for extreme price swings, which could negatively impact the company’s financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for XRP and other digital assets is still evolving globally, posing potential legal and compliance risks. The ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple adds a layer of complexity. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting and Tax Issues: The accounting treatment for crypto holdings is complex and can vary by jurisdiction. Tax implications need careful management. Market Perception: Some traditional investors may view this strategy as overly risky or speculative. Managing these challenges will be critical to the success of VivoPower’s pioneering approach. Is This a Trend for Corporate Treasury Going Forward? The question on many minds is whether VivoPower’s move is an isolated event or the start of a broader trend. While companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve, VivoPower ‘s focus on XRP is unique among publicly traded firms. Several factors could influence whether other companies follow suit: Regulatory Clarity: Greater regulatory certainty around digital assets would likely encourage more corporate adoption. Market Performance: Sustained positive performance of assets like XRP could make them more attractive as treasury holdings. Accounting Standards: Clearer and more consistent accounting standards for digital assets are needed. Peer Influence: If VivoPower demonstrates success (or struggles) with this strategy, it will certainly inform decisions at other companies. For now, VivoPower appears to be venturing into relatively uncharted territory for a Nasdaq-listed company, making its progress a key indicator for potential future trends in corporate treasury crypto strategies. Conclusion: A Bold Step in Institutional Crypto VivoPower’s decision to raise $121 million specifically for an XRP corporate treasury strategy, supported by significant investors and guided by former Ripple XRP expertise, represents a bold and potentially transformative step. It highlights the increasing interest in integrating digital assets into traditional financial structures and pushes the boundaries of what constitutes a corporate treasury asset. While the path forward involves navigating volatility and regulatory complexities, VivoPower’s initiative is a significant development in the evolution of institutional crypto adoption . The industry will be watching closely to see how this pioneering strategy unfolds and what it could mean for the future of corporate finance.

GOOD NEWS: Risk SIgnal is trending downwards, meaning over the broader environment buy-side liquidity is dominating. We are setting up for another solid run on the long time frame. pic.twitter.com/KUWNMc4HqB — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 28, 2025 Woo says that while the long-term trend still looks strong thanks to increasing buyer strength, there could be some turbulence ahead as many investors are already sitting on large profits and may soon cash out. Cycles Are Changing—The Old Rules Don’t Apply BTC is global macro this cycle. Which means don't necessarily bet on nicely manicured 4 year cycles. BTC is transitioning. Internal forces, the halvening, is getting weak, global liquidity powers BTC – hence BTC is becoming the canary in the coal mine for global macro moves. https://t.co/c56yYmn0Na — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 28, 2025 Woo explains that Bitcoin is no longer behaving like it did in past bull runs. Earlier, its four-year halving cycle had a big influence, but now, he says, the bigger force is global liquidity. That means BTC is acting more like a traditional asset, moving with global economic trends rather than its usual crypto patterns. Echoing Woo’s sentiment, crypto analyst Maui Jim believes it’s outdated to expect a predictable sell-off in September or a new bottom a year later. The market is maturing and becoming harder to predict. The fact that Bitcoin hit a new all-time high even before the halving was a major clue that the game has changed. Flat Buying Pressure Raises Eyebrows Despite the sharp price move from $75,000 to $110,000, Woo notes that capital inflows have been flat over the past few days, a surprising trend. This lack of buying pressure could spell trouble if U.S. markets don’t step in with more demand now that the long weekend is over. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan to Launch Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Will BTC Price Regain Bullish Momentum? , Still Room for $114K, But Warning Signs Flashing Woo hasn’t turned bearish just yet. He believes that if enough buyers return this week, Bitcoin could shoot up to $114,000 , potentially wiping out short positions. But if momentum fades, the market could cool off, forming bearish divergences and triggering another round of profit-taking. For now, Bitcoin sits just under $110,000, holding its recent gains but walking a fine line between continued rally and short-term correction. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Given the warning signs of speculation and market greed, it’s wise to consider taking partial profits, especially if you’re already sitting on significant gains. However, the long-term trend remains strong, so holding some position while setting stop-losses to protect profits can balance risk and reward. How might U.S. market demand influence Bitcoin’s price movement this week? Since capital inflows have been flat, renewed buying from U.S. institutions or retail could reignite momentum, pushing prices toward $114K. Conversely, if U.S. markets remain subdued, it may trigger selling pressure and a correction. Watching market open volumes and demand will be key. What does “flat buying pressure” signify for Bitcoin’s price? Despite the recent price jump, a lack of new capital inflows could lead to trouble if U.S. markets don’t inject more demand.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-bitcoins-rally-sustainable-willy-woo-highlights-risk-of-profit-taking-at-110k/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T05:40:49.000Z,"GameStop Bitcoin: Ryan Cohen Calls BTC a Potent Hedge Against Currency Devaluation","BitcoinWorld GameStop Bitcoin: Ryan Cohen Calls BTC a Potent Hedge Against Currency Devaluation In a move that grabbed headlines across both the finance and crypto worlds, Ryan Cohen, the CEO of GameStop, recently shared a significant perspective on the role of digital assets. According to reports citing Bitcoin Magazine via X, Cohen suggested that Bitcoin has the potential to act as a powerful hedge against global currency devaluation . This statement comes after Bitcoin World previously highlighted GameStop’s own substantial investment, having acquired 4,710 BTC. Why Does Ryan Cohen See Bitcoin as a Hedge? Ryan Cohen, known for his role in turning around Chewy and his involvement in the GameStop saga, is not a traditional finance insider. His perspective often comes from a place of challenging established norms. His view that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against currency devaluation likely stems from concerns about modern monetary policy and its potential impact on the purchasing power of traditional fiat currencies. Several factors could contribute to this viewpoint: Inflationary Pressures: Central banks globally have engaged in significant quantitative easing and stimulus measures over the past decade, particularly following economic crises. This increases the money supply, potentially leading to inflation, which erodes the value of savings and earnings held in traditional currencies. Government Debt: Rising levels of national debt in many countries can raise concerns about future economic stability and the temptation for governments to inflate away debt burdens. Centralization vs. Decentralization: Fiat currencies are controlled by central authorities (governments and central banks). Their supply and policies can be manipulated. Bitcoin, in contrast, is decentralized with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, making its issuance schedule predictable and beyond the control of any single entity. From this perspective, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature offer a potential escape hatch from the risks associated with centralized control and potential inflationary policies that lead to currency devaluation . Understanding the Bitcoin Hedge Concept The idea of using Bitcoin as a hedge is not new, but it gained significant traction during periods of economic uncertainty. A hedge is an investment intended to offset potential losses from another investment. Traditionally, assets like gold, silver, and real estate have been considered hedges against inflation or economic instability. How might Bitcoin function as a hedge, particularly against currency devaluation ? Limited Supply: Unlike fiat currencies, whose supply can be increased by central banks, Bitcoin has a hard cap on the total number of coins that will ever exist. This scarcity is often compared to precious metals and is seen as a fundamental defense against inflation driven by supply expansion. Decentralization: Bitcoin’s network operates independently of any government or financial institution. This makes it resistant to censorship, seizure, and policies that might negatively impact traditional assets or currencies within a specific jurisdiction. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin is a global asset, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This contrasts with national currencies, which are tied to specific countries and their economic fortunes. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the debate surrounding Bitcoin’s effectiveness as a hedge. Its relatively short history compared to gold, and its significant price volatility, mean it doesn’t always behave like a stable store of value in the short term. While it may protect against long-term currency devaluation , holders must be prepared for substantial price swings. GameStop’s Bold GameStop Bitcoin Investment Adding weight to Ryan Cohen ‘s public statements is GameStop’s tangible action: the purchase of 4,710 BTC. This investment signals a belief within the company’s leadership that holding Bitcoin is a strategic move for their corporate treasury. Details about the exact timing and rationale behind GameStop’s purchase of 4,710 BTC are key. While specific internal discussions aren’t public, the general motivations for a company like GameStop to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet likely align with the hedge concept mentioned by Cohen, alongside other potential benefits: Treasury Diversification: Moving a portion of corporate cash reserves out of traditional low-yield, inflation-susceptible assets into a potentially high-growth, uncorrelated asset class. Protection Against Inflation/Devaluation: Directly acting on the belief that Bitcoin can preserve purchasing power better than fiat over time, especially relevant given concerns about ongoing currency devaluation . Potential for Appreciation: While framed as a hedge, the potential for significant capital gains is undoubtedly a factor for companies adopting Bitcoin. Signaling: Adopting Bitcoin can signal forward-thinking, technological savvy, and potentially attract investors interested in digital assets. GameStop’s decision, under the leadership influenced by Ryan Cohen , positions it among a growing list of publicly traded companies embracing corporate Bitcoin adoption . The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption GameStop is not alone in adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Over the past few years, there has been a notable trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption among publicly traded companies. This movement was significantly popularized by firms like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has amassed a very large Bitcoin holding. Other notable examples include: MicroStrategy: A business intelligence firm that has become one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, consistently adding to its reserves. Tesla: The electric vehicle company, led by Elon Musk, made a significant Bitcoin purchase in early 2021, though they have also sold portions of their holdings at times. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s payments company has also invested in Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy. This trend underscores a shifting perception of Bitcoin , moving from a purely speculative retail asset to one considered viable for sophisticated corporate treasury management, often driven by the very concerns about currency devaluation that Ryan Cohen highlighted. Companies engaging in corporate Bitcoin adoption are making a calculated bet that the potential benefits – protection against inflation, diversification, and long-term appreciation – outweigh the risks associated with volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Navigating the Challenges of Using Bitcoin as a Hedge While the arguments for Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation are compelling to many, it’s essential to consider the challenges and risks involved. No investment is without its downsides, and Bitcoin is no exception. Key challenges include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile. While this offers potential for high returns, it also means significant drawdowns are possible, which might not align with the stability typically sought in a hedge asset. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact Bitcoin’s usability, legality, and market value. Security Risks: Holding Bitcoin requires secure storage solutions (wallets). Loss of private keys or security breaches can result in irreversible loss of funds. Market Manipulation Concerns: The crypto market is still relatively young and can be susceptible to large players influencing prices. These challenges mean that while Ryan Cohen and GameStop see Bitcoin as a potential hedge, it’s a strategy that requires a high tolerance for risk and a long-term perspective, acknowledging that short-term performance may not always align with traditional hedge characteristics. What Does This Mean for Investors and Businesses? Actionable Insights The statements from figures like Ryan Cohen and the actions of companies engaging in corporate Bitcoin adoption raise important questions for both individual investors and businesses considering their own financial strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Educate Yourself: Understand what Bitcoin is, how it works, and the economic principles behind the arguments for and against its use as a hedge. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and ensure it fits within your overall financial strategy. Consider Diversification: A hedge is typically part of a diversified portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Explore different asset classes. Evaluate Long-Term Trends: If you believe that concerns about currency devaluation are valid long-term risks, explore assets like Bitcoin or others traditionally considered hedges (like gold) that might offer protection. For Businesses: Carefully evaluate treasury management goals, risk appetite, and regulatory considerations before considering holding volatile assets like Bitcoin. Consult with financial and legal experts. The fact that a company like GameStop, influenced by Ryan Cohen , is publicly acknowledging Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge and backing it with investment is a significant data point in the ongoing evolution of how digital assets are perceived and utilized in the global economy. Summary: Bitcoin’s Growing Role in a Devaluing World Ryan Cohen’s assertion that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against global currency devaluation , coupled with GameStop’s concrete action of purchasing 4,710 BTC, highlights a growing recognition of digital assets in mainstream finance. This perspective is rooted in concerns about inflationary pressures and the stability of traditional fiat currencies in an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and government debt. While the concept of Bitcoin as a hedge is debated due to its volatility, its fixed supply and decentralized nature offer characteristics appealing to those seeking alternatives to centralized currency systems. GameStop’s move is part of a broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption , where companies are exploring digital assets for treasury diversification and potential long-term value preservation. For both individuals and businesses, this development underscores the importance of understanding the changing financial landscape, evaluating the risks and potential benefits of assets like Bitcoin, and considering how best to navigate a world where concerns about currency devaluation are becoming increasingly prominent.

2025-05-29T05:39:11.000Z,"HTX DeepThink: Rotation Signals Emerging–Crypto Credit and InfoFi Poised as New Market Focal Points","BitcoinWorld HTX DeepThink: Rotation Signals Emerging–Crypto Credit and InfoFi Poised as New Market Focal Points SINGAPORE, May 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — As May draws to a close, the crypto market continues its upward momentum, fueled by a renewed wave of macro liquidity. Bitcoin demonstrates resilience, with improved on-chain capital structure and a steady rise in risk appetite. High-beta assets and quality altcoins are drawing increasing attention, signaling an emerging rotation trend. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research explores the evolving potential and structural value of crypto credit and InfoFi as key sectors in this next phase. Structural Shift Under Macro Support: Bitcoin Holds Firm as Altseason Builds Momentum As of May 21, 2025, the Federal Reserve’s net liquidity has rebounded to 6,022.869, recovering strongly from its early-May low. Although it has not yet reached the key range of 6,100–6,200, this trend signals an initial return of liquidity, providing macro-level support for the crypto market. Despite last week’s long-bond auctions disappointing on both sides of the Pacific—with the U.S. 20-year yield pushed above 5 %, and Japan’s long-end rates setting 25-year highs—stoking global liquidity-squeeze fears, the impact is somewhat mitigated. The U.S. Treasury is primarily absorbing cash mainly via 3- to 6-month T-Bills, which tends to drain money-market funds rather than risk assets. Furthermore, the Fed retains the ability to pause quantitative tightening (QT) or open its repo facilities at will, capping potential spillover effects. Bitcoin has held firm. Spot ETFs continue to post modest daily inflows, over 70 % of Bitcoin supply has remained dormant for six months or more, exchange balances are falling, and Asian/Middle-East buyers continue to buy dips. Even if net Treasury issuance jumps to roughly $1.25 trillion in Q3, short-dated supply and repo backstops dilute the drag on high-beta assets, while ETF passive holdings and “hard hands” diffuse selling pressure; a weaker-dollar narrative adds further support. On-chain data shows that public chains like Solana and Base are seeing sustained increases in activity, with capital gradually shifting from BTC-dominated safe-haven assets to high-beta altcoins. BTC Dominance remains elevated and has not yet experienced a significant pullback, but if it drops below 52% in the coming sessions, coupled with further liquidity expansion, a new altcoin season could kick off. Analysis on Trending Sectors Wall Street Doubles Down on Crypto Credit: Maple Becomes the Institutional Capital Gateway Cantor Fitzgerald has launched a Bitcoin-collateralized credit program with a total size of $2 billion, signaling Wall Street’s formal and large-scale entry into the crypto credit market. Initial recipients of this facility include crypto broker FalconX and the decentralized lending protocol Maple Finance. FalconX has already drawn over $100 million under this framework, and Maple Finance has completed its first loan issuance through the program. The $SYRUP token , associated with Maple Finance, is available on HTX through spot trading, perpetual futures, and earn products. Since its spot listing, $SYRUP has surged by 110%, with strong performance also seen in derivatives—underscoring growing market recognition and investor confidence in the project. Maple’s newly launched syrupUSDC/USDT perpetual institutional credit pool offers 8–12% annual yields with high collateral transparency, rapidly attracting large volumes of idle institutional stablecoins. This month, the TVL surged from $800 million to $1.3 billion—markets are “voting with their feet,” fully validating the appeal and growth potential of the SYRUP model. InfoFi Rising Star: $COOKIE Poised to Trigger the Next Revaluation Cycle Based on current on-chain trends and macro liquidity data, $COOKIE is expected to be on the verge of explosive growth within the InfoFi sector. Compared to similarly positioned projects like Kaito, CookieDotFun’s current market cap is just one-fifth. Once the Cookie leaderboard, ad slot bidding, and other InfoFi monetization mechanisms go live, $COOKIE’ valuation ceiling could be lifted. HTX has launched COOKIE/USDT perpetual futures , while KAITO —previously featured in the HTX DeepThink column—has also been listed on HTX , with a remarkable 138% gain over the past 30 days. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

Which Is The Best Pick For Maximum Gains?","The post Litecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, Bitcoin, Dogecoin Or Mantix? Which Is The Best Pick For Maximum Gains? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Top investors looking for the best cryptos to buy in 2025 are paying attention to Litecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Mantix. Hedge Fund managers are making big moves into crypto and with crypto presales powered by AI craze gaining traction in 2025, now may be the last chance to get positioned for immense returns. In the broader market, Bitcoin continues to break through to new highs dragging along other top altcoins. Most altcoins are showing positive signals and Mantix has led the way by raising $600,000 in its presale in just weeks. Let’s look at some of the most popular assets and explain why Mantix is set to rise 100x shortly. Litecoin slumps amidst waning interest Litecoin has had it rough with the LTC price falling by 2.1% in the past 24 hours to $95.65 , due to general market pressures and a negative technical forecast. The SEC postponed its decisions on spot Litecoin ETFs from Canary Capital and Grayscale, now planning to decide in late 2025. This lowered the earlier odds of Litecoin’s ETF approval on Polymarket from 90% to 76% as of today. Yet, people remain optimistic, with analysts aiming for a push to $120 by Q3. Litecoin still remains a good choice for conservative traders. Current Litecoin price action suggests LTC will continue its slow grind higher, especially if Bitcoin keeps building momentum. Legal clarity improves Ripple price outlook With Ripple’s legal win versus the SEC, XRP is once again attracting massive investor interest. The price is now trading around $2.34, up 6% in the past month and consolidating after an unprecedented March surge. Market analysts have adjusted their Ripple price predictions, with the new target being a move towards $3.20 if the overall market sentiment heralded by Bitcoin’s surge above ATH remains positive. Ripple’s cross-border payment technology is already being implemented by a number of central banks, and if ETFs pegged to XRP are greenlighted later this year, prices could take off leaving Ripple as a formidable contender in 2025’s list of best crypto to buy. Solana and Tron are making their networks more stable by minting USDT. Both Solana and Tron are making a name for themselves as reliable and fast blockchains, with similar goals in scalability, affordable transactions and a strong DeFi sector. Solana and Tron rely on hybrid consensus methods PoH, PoS and DPoS respectively to handle thousands of transactions at once, making them suitable for stablecoin use. Since January 2025, Tether’s USDT has been minted in large amounts on both Tron ($3 billion) and Solana ($7.75 billion in USDC, a USDT rival), according to Spot On Chain data. The mints make trading and using DeFi smooth, since Tron’s fixed $1 fee and Solana’s very low fees guarantee cost savings. Analysts expect Solana to increase to $290-$364 by late 2025 and Tron’s strong use cases could see it reach $0.40 if stablecoin adoption and Tron’s gasless USDT transfers continue. Bitcoin and Dogecoin prove to be crypto’s steady giants; is there more upside to come? Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $109,500 after rebounding from April’s $74,000 dip, with analysts eyeing $120,000 soon and possibly $325,000 by July 2026. Top analysts from Coincodex and Standard Chartered project Bitcoin to hit $170,000–$200,000 by year-end. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has remained relevant thanks to its community loyal to its OG meme status. Many market experts believe Dogecoin is a dependable “crypto giant” that could still bring high ROI, as long as the overall crypto market keeps growing. Together, BTC and DOGE reflect crypto’s dual appeal: institutional trust and cultural relevance. Mantix is 2025’s unicorn set for explosive returns Among all the viable competitors for crypto investment in 2025, Mantix represents the highest-upside play for life-changing returns. The product is a new decentralized trading platform that combines deep liquidity, high-leverage futures of up to 1000x and zero-downtime. Mantix also offers instant buyback-and-burn mechanisms and revenue sharing for $MTX token holders, perks even top exchanges rarely offer. Mantix has come out with a new ICO currently in its first Stage. Right now, the $MTX token can be purchased for just $0.02, with more than $600,000 already invested by early believers. Unlike most of the top altcoins, Mantix is still under the mainstream radar, giving early adopters a first-mover advantage. When comparing user rewards, decentralization and token use case, Mantix is better positioned than most in the top 10 altcoins making it the best option for savvy investors looking for the best returns.

2025-05-29T05:35:08.000Z,"New Document: Bank of France Prefers XRP Features to Issuing Europe’s CBDC","A recent tweet by crypto researcher SMQKE has reignited attention on France’s ongoing exploration of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), highlighting the country’s apparent preference for the XRP Ledger’s architecture as a model for its digital currency ambitions. Citing official documentation and statements from French authorities, the tweet states: “Remember, the Bank of France ‘prefers’ the features of XRP to issue Europe’s Central Bank Digital Currency. Documented.” The documentation in question includes a report from Piper Alderman referencing a publication by CPA Australia, which states that France has “openly discussed Ripple/XRP as a possible platform to Europe’s central digital currency.” The report underscores the appeal of XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) due to its highly centralised architecture and permissioned network capabilities. These characteristics stand in contrast to open, public blockchain networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which, while decentralised, are less suitable for central banking requirements concerning transaction privacy, speed, and regulatory control. Remember, the Bank of France “prefers” the features of XRP to issue Europe’s Central Bank Digital Currency. Documented. https://t.co/DDvBlO58Cb pic.twitter.com/BX1HKzAkvg — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 28, 2025 XRP Ledger Highlighted for Its Permissioned Network and Centralised Design The XRP Ledger’s design offers a compelling framework for central banks, allowing only authorised validators to confirm transactions. This model enables a high level of control and compliance, which are essential for the issuance and management of digital currencies by state monetary authorities. According to the CPA Australia report, this configuration has earned XRP the trust of many banks that consider it a viable technological foundation for CBDCs. Ripple’s proposal, as highlighted in the Piper Alderman document, showcases how the XRP Ledger can meet critical requirements for speed and security that are not attainable with fully decentralised public networks. The same report adds that while some blockchain technologies may not align with CBDC goals, configurations like XRPL can still meet the high standards required for official monetary systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bank of France Emphasises Need for Secure Settlement Assets Further supporting this position is a recent speech delivered by Denis Beau, the First Deputy Governor of the Bank of France, at the Fintech R:Evolution summit in Paris on May 21, 2025. The speech, officially published by the Bank for International Settlements, outlines three pillars for developing the European financial ecosystem, one of which is the tokenisation of finance. Beau confirmed that the lack of a secure settlement asset is currently impeding tokenized finance in Europe. In response, he stated that the Eurosystem has committed to providing a wholesale CBDC by 2026 to meet this need. The Bank of France has identified that integrating such a secure asset is crucial not only for domestic financial stability but also for ensuring Europe’s monetary sovereignty. In this context, the suitability of platforms like the XRP Ledger becomes especially relevant. As the documentation notes, Ripple’s proposal demonstrates how certain configurations of blockchain technology can satisfy the security, efficiency, and scalability requirements for CBDC implementation. France Positions Itself as a Leader in European CBDC Development Denis Beau also emphasized the importance of harmonized regulatory frameworks such as MiCA and the Pilot Regime in facilitating the growth of tokenized assets across Europe. He pointed out that despite progress, significant obstacles remain, particularly the need for central bank-backed infrastructure to enable safe and scalable blockchain-based financial systems. The formal inclusion of market representatives in discussions about regulatory implementation and technological deployment signals a coordinated effort by French and European financial authorities to shape the digital economy. Beau concluded his speech by stating his conviction that the French ecosystem has strong potential in developing high-value-added CBDC use cases. XRP Features Align with Eurozone’s Digital Currency Vision Taken together, the statements from the Bank of France, the referenced CPA Australia report, and the documentation shared by SMQKE converge on a central message: the features of the XRP Ledger align closely with the operational demands of a European CBDC. While no final platform has been officially designated, XRP’s architecture remains under active consideration by key monetary authorities in Europe.

2025-05-29T05:30:00.000Z,"US and UK Advance Crypto Regulations for Retirement and Custody","Two of the world’s leading financial regulators took significant steps this week toward formalizing the role of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance. In the United States, the Labor Department officially reversed its 2022 guidance discouraging crypto assets in 401(k) retirement plans, restoring fiduciary discretion for plan managers. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) opened a public consultation on proposed rules for stablecoins and crypto custody, aiming to support innovation while reinforcing market trust and consumer protection. US Labor Department Rescinds Biden-Era Crypto Retirement Investment Limits in Major Shift The US Department of Labor has formally rescinded a 2022 guidance that discouraged the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans, signaling a major pivot in federal retirement investment policy and reflecting a broader pro-crypto shift under the Trump administration. The announcement, made on May 28, revokes a controversial compliance bulletin that had urged fiduciaries to “exercise extreme care” when considering digital assets for retirement offerings. At the time, the Biden-era agency cited volatility, valuation uncertainty, and security risks as key reasons for opposing crypto exposure in employer-sponsored plans. But the current Labor Department, under Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, has now reversed that stance, calling the 2022 guidance an “overreach” and a break from the agency’s historically neutral approach to fiduciary responsibilities. The move is being framed as a return to a “principled-based” framework, in which plan managers, rather than federal regulators, assess whether digital assets are suitable for long-term retirement strategies. Chavez-DeRemer emphasized that fiduciaries are in the best position to weigh the merits and risks of cryptocurrencies based on the unique needs of plan participants, as opposed to receiving top-down prohibitive mandates from Washington. This change effectively grants retirement plan providers more discretion to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets in 401(k) offerings, potentially opening the door to broader mainstream adoption among long-term savers. The American Banking Association (ABA), which had previously criticized the 2022 guidance for being issued without public review or comment, applauded the rollback. The ABA argued that the prior administration’s action amounted to de facto rulemaking without transparency or due process. Backstory: A Cautious Past The original guidance issued in March 2022 by the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) was widely viewed as a chilling message to retirement providers. The memo warned that cryptocurrencies were speculative, volatile, and susceptible to fraud, and that offering them in 401(k) plans could place fiduciaries at legal risk under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). It also coincided with high-profile crypto market collapses, including the TerraUSD meltdown and the eventual implosion of FTX, which reinforced skepticism among regulators and the public. Several asset managers, including Fidelity Investments, pushed back against the guidance at the time, insisting that digital assets offered a valid diversification strategy, particularly for younger investors. Fidelity, one of the few major financial institutions to defy the Biden-era resistance, launched its Digital Assets Account (DAA) for 401(k)s in 2022, allowing plan sponsors to offer Bitcoin exposure to their employees. The investment giant structured the product with robust compliance measures and minimal fees, arguing that retirement savers deserved optional access to emerging asset classes. Fidelity’s pioneering effort sparked debate about whether mainstream investors should have crypto exposure in their retirement portfolios—debate that is likely to intensify in the wake of the Labor Department’s new stance. Broader Crypto Policy Under Trump The Labor Department's reversal is part of a larger trend under President Donald Trump’s current administration, which has adopted a decisively pro-crypto posture. Trump has pledged to make the US “the world capital of crypto,” and federal agencies have taken steps to dial back regulatory crackdowns on high-profile crypto platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap. Simultaneously, the administration has launched exploratory frameworks for tokenizing real-world assets ( RWAs ), such as bonds and commodities, and for defining clearer rules around digital asset classifications—efforts praised by many in the blockchain industry. Despite these advances, some lawmakers remain wary of the Trump administration’s close alignment with the crypto industry, citing the need for guardrails to prevent systemic risks and ensure retail investor protection. Critics have also called for more transparency regarding Trump's own business interests in the sector. The Labor Department's updated position does not constitute a blanket endorsement of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans. Rather, it shifts the responsibility and liability back to fiduciaries, who must still uphold their duty to act in the best interests of plan participants. Industry analysts expect many asset managers to proceed cautiously, balancing client demand with evolving legal and regulatory standards. Nevertheless, the reversal may pave the way for a surge in crypto retirement product development, including new portfolio options, managed funds, and potentially tokenized pension models in the coming years. UK’s FCA Unveils Draft Rules for Stablecoins and Crypto Custody, Opens Door to Public Feedback Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has taken another critical step toward formalizing its cryptocurrency regulatory framework. On May 28, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a consultation paper requesting public feedback on proposed regulations for stablecoins and crypto custody services. The initiative marks what the FCA described as a “milestone on the road to crypto regulation” as the UK pushes forward with plans to become a global leader in responsible digital asset innovation. The proposals aim to provide a robust and secure environment for crypto users and investors, while preserving the flexibility necessary for continued technological growth in the fintech space. The consultation will remain open in the coming weeks, inviting perspectives from both industry stakeholders and the general public. David Geale, Executive Director of Payments and Digital Finance at the FCA, emphasized the regulator’s dual commitment to innovation and integrity. “At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets,” Geale said. “At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.” The new proposals reflect extensive input from roundtable discussions, industry consultations, and the broader global movement toward regulated digital assets. The FCA acknowledged that while crypto has become increasingly integrated into the UK’s financial ecosystem, the lack of clear rules has left investors vulnerable and market participants operating in a legal grey area. One of the FCA’s core objectives is to ensure that regulated stablecoins maintain their promised peg to a fiat currency, such as the British pound or US dollar. Under the proposed rules, issuers of qualifying stablecoins would be legally obligated to honor 1:1 redemption rights at par value, regardless of the fluctuating value of backing asset portfolios. “We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency,” the FCA wrote, “with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.” To reinforce consumer protections, stablecoin issuers would be required to appoint independent, third-party custodians to safeguard their reserve assets. Issuers must also disclose clear and accessible information about the structure and quality of the asset backing. This push for transparency comes amid growing global scrutiny over stablecoin reserve practices, especially after the collapse of poorly backed stablecoins like TerraUSD in 2022 triggered industry-wide contagion. Coordination with the Bank of England The FCA is working in tandem with the Bank of England (BoE) to construct a comprehensive framework for stablecoins, especially those that could operate at systemic scale. Sarah Breeden, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the BoE, confirmed that the central bank will release a complementary consultation paper later this year. In a separate discussion paper, the FCA introduced sweeping new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services. These proposals are designed to bolster investor confidence by ensuring that crypto assets are held securely and remain readily accessible at all times. Custodians will be expected to follow strict internal controls, implement high-security measures, and maintain transparent procedures for asset segregation, incident reporting, and recovery mechanisms. The proposed rules also seek to reduce both the likelihood and impact of institutional failure, in direct response to previous collapses such as Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX, where customers faced prolonged access delays or complete loss of assets.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9355/us-and-uk-advance-crypto-regulations-for-retirement-and-custody,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

The BlackRock fund saw another large inflow day on May 28 with $481 million entering the ETF. This has culminated in 33 consecutive trading days without an outflow, the last of which was on April 9. Another nearly *$500mil* into iShares Bitcoin ETF… Starting to get ridiculous. Inflows 30 of past 31 days. Nearly $9.5bil in new $$$. IBIT comfortably in top 5 ETFs by inflows this year (out of 4,200+ ETFs). — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) May 29, 2025 Institutional Bitcoin Consumption IBIT is comfortably in the top 5 ETFs by inflows this year out of more than 4,200 funds, observed Geraci. Additionally, IBIT has seen $3.86 billion in inflows over the past fortnight, with a daily average of $430 million. In total, the fund has seen $48.8 billion in inflows since it launched in January 2024. It holds $71 billion in assets under management, which is equivalent to around 650,000 BTC. BlackRock was the only Bitcoin ETF to see an inflow on Wednesday, with Fidelity and Ark 21Shares outflowing $14 million and $34.3 million, respectively, according to Farside Investors. IBIT has been on fire lately, now has $72 billion in assets, which ranks it 23rd overall, “absolutely bonkers for a one-year-old,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The big BlackRock figures emphasize the sentiment that this rally is institutionally driven, as large corporations are also adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, the latest being GameStop , and retail appears to be absent . Balchunas opined that it feels like it’s inevitable that a “Big Boy US company” adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet soon. “Could definitely see Meta being the one to break the ice,” he added. “If a Meta or Microsoft adds BTC to its balance sheet, it will arguably have a bigger impact than all the smaller companies doing it, kinda like when Tom Hanks got COVID, everyone was like ‘oh shit Tom Hanks got it’ which made it feel real even tho the cases had already been mounting.” Crypto Market Outlook Spot markets have dipped 2% on the day, with total capitalization falling to $3.55 trillion. The fall has been led by Bitcoin, which failed to reclaim $108,000 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session and dipped 1% on the day. Ethereum was moving in the opposite direction, adding 4% on the day to top $2,750 at the time of writing, while most of the altcoins were flat.

2025-05-29T05:19:44.000Z,"Elon Musk leaves DOGE as job was ‘uphill battle’","Elon Musk confirmed that he’s quitting as the White House’s government cost-cutting czar after admitting it was an “uphill battle” trying to slash federal jobs and programs. Musk’s status as a Special Government Employee leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) meant that by law, he could only serve for a maximum of 130 days, which was set to finish on May 30. Musk confirmed his exit in a May 29 X post, thanking President Donald Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.” Reuters reported that a White House official said his “off-boarding will begin tonight.” Musk told The Washington Post for a May 27 report that the “federal bureaucracy situation is much worse” than he expected, and it was “an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.” In separate comments to CBS, Musk criticized the multi-trillion-dollar tax break package that House Republicans approved on May 22, claiming it would increase the budget deficit and undermine the work that DOGE is doing. DOGE, which is named after the cryptocurrency, claims to have saved taxpayers $175 billion since Trump’s Jan. 20 return to the White House, a figure heavily disputed by multiple news outlets, which report the figures are overstated, have multiple errors and are inaccurate. The project’s claimed savings are only 8.5% of Musk’s initial ambition to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, which he later revised down to $150 billion. According to the Reuters report, DOGE has cut almost 12%, or 260,000, of the 2.3 million federal workforce through layoffs, buyouts and early retirement offers. Despite the criticisms, Musk said on X that DOGE’s mission will “only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” Source: Elon Musk It comes as a federal judge allowed a lawsuit to proceed that accuses Musk and DOGE of illegally exerting power over government operations. The lawsuit, filed by 14 states, alleged that Musk and DOGE violated the Constitution by illegally accessing government data systems, terminating federal employees and canceling contracts at federal agencies. Musk admits he spent too much time in politics In a May 28 interview with Ars Technica, Musk, the CEO of EV maker Tesla, admitted that he spent “a bit too much time” in politics, which some critics claim has impacted Tesla’s performance . “I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics,” Musk said. However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement. “It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.” When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income. As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin ( BTC ), currently valued at about $1.24 billion. Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launch Tesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter. However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.

A favorable decision was expected to push ADA past the $0.80 mark. However, the delay could now negatively impact the price. The MACD and short-term averages indicate selling pressure, but the long-term outlook is still positive for ADA. Traders on Polymarket are still positive, as it shows a 67% chance of a Cardano ETF approval by the year-end. The community is not surprised, as some see these setbacks as buying opportunities. They say that the regulators may slow the process, but they cannot stop the technology or the believers who keep accumulating. Grayscale filed for the Cardano Trust listing with NYSE Arca in February 2025, then updated the proposal for public feedback. The SEC had 45 days to decide, but pushed the deadline from April 14 to May 29, and now it’s delayed again.

They just lined up $750 million in private backing. There’s a plan to raise up to $1.5 billion if warrants get exercised. It’s a bold step that puts them in the club of top treasury buyers. Big Fundraise And Future Plans Based on reports , Strive’s $750 million comes from a group of VC firms that chose to stay unnamed. The money kicks off what the firm calls its “first wave of Bitcoin accumulation.” If all the warrants get pulled in, they’ll have nearly double that—$1.5 billion—to spend. That would make them one of the biggest corporate Bitcoin holders around. Using Active Trading Moves Instead of just buying and holding, Strive says they’ll mix in active trading.

Strategy keeps buying hard. In its last push, Strategy snapped up 4,020 BTC for $427 million. That move bumped its total above 580,250 BTC. Meanwhile, a business linked to US President Donald Trump landed $2.5 billion to grow its own stash. Strive will have to move fast to keep pace with those giants. Distressed Bitcoin Claims In View Strive also sees a chance in legal messes tied to old bankruptcies. They’ve talked about more than 75,000 BTC stuck in claims from events like Mt. Gox. Buying those coins at a discount could pay off if the legal side clears up. But those processes can drag on for years. A Push For Institutional Interest Earlier this year, Strive pitched a merger with Asset Entities to launch a public firm focused on Bitcoin as a treasury asset. In February, CEO Matt Cole even urged GameStop to swap its $5 billion cash pile for Bitcoin, saying it would turn the video game retailer into a market leader.

2025-05-29T05:00:28.000Z,"Shiba Inu Trapped Inside Triangle: 17% Move Incoming?","An analyst has pointed out that Shiba Inu is currently trading within a triangle pattern, which could set up a 17% move for the memecoin. 4-Hour Price Of Shiba Inu Has Been Consolidating Inside A Triangle Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that has been forming on the 4-hour chart of Shiba Inu recently. The pattern in question is a triangle from technical analysis (TA). This type of channel emerges when the price of an asset observes consolidation between two trendlines that converge at some common point. The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance, while the lower one is a source of support. Related Reading: Ethereum May Be One Dip Away From Mass Losses—Data Warns There are a few different types of triangles in TA, with the most popular ones being the ascending, descending, and symmetrical variations. The arrangement of the trendlines dictates which type of asset the asset is following. When one of the trendlines is parallel to the time-axis, one of the former two appears. The ascending variation forms when consolidation is toward a net upside. That is, when the upper line is flat and the lower one is sloped upward. Similarly, the descending one involves the opposite orientation. The third type, the symmetrical triangle, has both of the trendlines angled at an equal and opposite slope. In this variation, consolidation narrows down to a point in a sideways manner. In triangle patterns, a breakout from one of the trendlines often ends up being around the same length as the height of the triangle (that is, the distance between the upper and lower line at their extreme). Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the triangle that Shiba Inu’s 4-hour price has been moving inside over the last few weeks: From the graph, it would appear that the triangle that Shiba Inu has been inside recently is of the descending type, as its price has overall been moving down over this timeframe. Based on the pattern, Martinez has noted that SHIB could be heading toward a 17% swing. Related Reading: How Does Bitcoin Investor Behavior Shape Trends? Glassnode Reveals But which way could this move appear in? Generally, a descending triangle is considered to be a continuation pattern for a bearish trend. It can also, however, sometimes act as a reversal pattern, with a breakout coming in the upward direction instead. At present, Shiba Inu is sitting near the midway point between the two trendlines. As such, it only remains to be seen which of the two lines it might visit next. As the consolidation lengthens, the triangular channel is only getting tighter, so one way or the other, a break may occur soon. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.00001436, down about 2% in the last seven days.

The Trump administration immediately filed a notice that it was appealing the ruling . On Wednesday, the court in Manhattan ruled in favor of Democratic-led states and a group of small businesses that argued Trump had wrongfully invoked an emergency law to justify this part of economic policy. Recent trade negotiations by the US have not only roiled global equity markets but have also had a significant impact on Bitcoin as well. Asian Markets Open in Green, US Stock Futures Surge Global financial markets have experienced sharp fluctuations since Trump unveiled extensive tariffs on April 2, with some measures later eased or reversed amid ongoing negotiations between the White House and foreign governments . Though Bitcoin remained mostly unchanged, Asian stock markets climbed on Thursday morning, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 gaining roughly 1.67% and Australia’s ASX 200 posting modest gains. India’s Nifty and Sensex also opened in green. Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures surged following a favorable court decision. Arthur Hayes Issues “Buy Everything” Signal Reacting to the US Court striking down Trump’s liberation day tariffs, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes posted on X, “buy everything round dos,” issuing a buying signal to investors. Hayes also made a case for Bitcoin reaching $1 million at the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vega s in a keynote speech on Wednesday. Buy everything round dos. pic.twitter.com/VDPxGFYczX — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) May 29, 2025 Arthur pointed out how the $4 trillion stimulus injected into U.S. markets from 2020 to 2021 helped propel Bitcoin’s price from $3,800 to $70,000, driven by supply constraints from ETF demand and long-term holdings. He argued that the projected capital injection through 2028, which is double that of the post-COVID period, combined with shrinking Bitcoin supply, creates a strong macro environment where reaching $1 million per BTC is not only possible but likely.

You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said.“I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.”New York City Mayor Eric Adams wants a Bitcoin bond and to axe the State BitLicense program. BitSource: YouTubeAdams didn’t share details about how a Bitbond would work; however, a March 31 policy brief paper from advocacy group the Bitcoin Policy Institute proposed a model where holders receive an annual interest rate of 1% for 10 years.When the bond matures, holders also receive a percentage of any Bitcoin market gains. At the same time, 90% of the funds raised through the bonds are allocated to government spending, while 10% is used to purchase Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s bond policy brief.Adams again pushes to axe BitLicenseAdams also called for repealing New York’s BitLicense program, which the state launched in 2015 ﻿and requires crypto businesses to apply for a license with the New York Department of Financial Services and meet strict compliance standards.The BitLicense program has received criticism from the industry, and Adams has also said the measure is too costly with high licensing fees, and is too stringent with its Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures. “You have a mayor who is the crypto mayor, is the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the city of New York, where you won’t be attacked and criminalized,” he said.“Let’s get rid of the Bitcoin license and allow us to have the free flow of Bitcoin in our city.”Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summitUSDC stablecoin issuer Circle was one of the first crypto companies to receive a BitLicense; others have since followed, including crypto exchange Coinbase and trading firm Bakkt.Adams has been actively pushing to attract crypto firms to New York City.

Source: CoinMarketCapThe Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed.“It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.”On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers, levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10%.Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified.“The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, really — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said, “Buy everything round dos.”Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrowCrypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said, “So Trump tariffs are illegal?

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share.

Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends.

Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin’s failure to maintain above the $109,588 level may have attracted selling by short-term traders. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000 and later to the pattern target of $3,153.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($2,467). The failure of a bullish setup may trap the aggressive bulls, sinking the pair to $2,323 and below that to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been trading between the moving averages, indicating a lack of aggressive buying or selling.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($2.33) and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price dips below the 50-day SMA ($2.24), the XRP/USDT pair could dive to the $2 support. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61.On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA opens the gates for a rally to $2.65. Buyers will have to drive the pair above $2.65 to catapult the price to $3.BNB price predictionBuyers pushed BNB (BNB) above the $693 resistance on May 27 but could not sustain the higher levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe price action of the past few days has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $693. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could rally toward the pattern target of $752.The 20-day EMA ($658) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could accelerate selling as the aggressive bulls may cover their positions. That could tug the pair to the 50-day SMA ($622).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) has been consolidating inside a narrow range between the 20-day EMA ($169) and the overhead resistance at $180.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The SOL/USDT pair could descend to $159 and later to the 50-day SMA ($153), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the pair could swing between $153 and $180 for some time.A break and close above $180 signals the resumption of the up move. The pair could pick up momentum and rally to the $210 to $220 resistance zone.Dogecoin price predictionSellers are trying to pull Dogecoin (DOGE) below the immediate support at the 20-day EMA ($0.22).DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the horizontal support at $0.21. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.21 level with all their might because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($0.19). Such a move brings the large $0.14 to $0.26 range into play.On the contrary, a rebound off $0.21 suggests the bulls are vigorously defending the level. That could keep the pair inside the $0.21 to $0.26 range for a few more days.Cardano price predictionBuyers have managed to keep Cardano (ADA) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern, but the bounce lacks strength.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThat increases the risk of a break below the 50-day SMA ($0.70). If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to the solid support at $0.60. That suggests the markets have rejected the breakout from the bullish setup.Buyers will have to push the price above the $0.86 resistance to indicate the resumption of the up move. The pair may then rally to $1.01, where the bears may mount a strong defense.Related: SUI price chart hints at 2x rally amid Nasdaq ETF filingSui price predictionSui (SUI) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($3.66) on May 28, indicating that the sentiment remains negative and the traders are selling on rallies.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to sink the SUI/USDT pair to the 50-day SMA ($3.24), which is a key level to keep an eye on.

If they can pull it off, the pair may rally to the $3.90 to $4.25 overhead zone.On the other hand, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests that the bears remain in control. The pair could then plunge to the $2.86 support.Hyperliquid price predictionHyperliquid (HYPE) turned down from $40 on May 26 and broke below the breakout level of $35.73 on May 28. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThere is support at $32, but if the level cracks, the HYPE/USDT pair could extend the slide to the 20-day EMA ($30).

That suggests solid demand at lower levels. The bulls will then make one more attempt to drive the pair to the overhead resistance of $42.25.Chainlink price predictionChainlink (LINK) continues to find support at the neckline of the H&S pattern, but the bulls have failed to start a strong rebound.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($15.66) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoption","The Katana Foundation, a nonprofit focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) development, is launching its private mainnet, aiming to unlock greater crypto asset productivity via deeper liquidity and higher yields for users.The Katana Foundation launched a DeFi-optimized, private blockchain, Katana, on May 28, incubated by GSR Markets and Polygon Labs, with the public mainnet launch set for June.The new blockchain will enable users to earn higher yields and explore DeFi in a “unique, optimized yield environment” that unlocks latent value through an ecosystem that makes every digital asset “work harder,” according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph.“DeFi users deserve ecosystems that prioritize sustainable liquidity and consistent ‘real’ yields,” wrote Marc Boiron, the CEO of Polygon Labs and core contributor at Katana, adding: “Katana’s user-centric model turns inefficiencies into advantages, establishing a truly positive-sum environment for builders and participants alike.\""Source: KatanaKatana aims to solve the crypto industry’s liquidity fragmentation issue, which can cause significant price slippage, as one of the main barriers limiting institutional DeFi participationRelated: Here’s how abstraction minimizes fragmentation in DeFi, making it more fluidTo reduce the value slippage in DeFi, Katana’s blockchain concentrates the liquidity from numerous protocols and collects yields on all potential sources to create an ecosystem with deeper liquidity and more predictable lending and borrowing rates.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey. Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved. And when in doubt, always verify before sending funds.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/elderly-crypto-investors-are-getting-scammed-teach-them-these-key-safety-tips?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe relative strength index (RSI) has climbed to 47 from 31 on April 8, indicating that bullish momentum is building up.However, to sustain the ongoing recovery, XRP’s price has to first hold the support at $2.20 and then overcome the resistance between $2.60 and $2.80.Several analysts are optimistic about a rebound higher, with pseudonymous trader Cryptowzrd saying that a validation of a falling wedge could see XRP break out toward $2.90.“$XRP closed indecisively and is still maintaining a falling wedge formation,” the trader wrote in a May 28 post on X, adding: “A breakout of this wedge will push markets toward the $2.80 resistance.

2025-05-28T09:59:06.000Z,"Fungible cryptos in secondary sales are not securities, Ripple tells SEC","Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP, argued that fungible cryptocurrencies are not securities when transferred in secondary transactions in a recent letter sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In its May 27 letter, Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech.

My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past.

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
