2025-05-29T15:33:56.000Z,"Trump Coin Price Prediction: $500M Flood Suggests Political Catalyst Could Be Days Away","Trump Coin (TRUMP) is trading at $12.48 today, holding relatively steady despite broader market weakness that’s seen most major tokens dip. While TRUMP remains down 19% in the past week and 9% over the past month — and still 73% below its all-time high of $73.43 — recent developments suggest a potential reversal. Trump Media’s alleged plan to raise $2.5 billion to stockpile Bitcoin (BTC) has reignited speculative interest, helping daily trading volumes climb back to $500 million. If this momentum builds, the Trump Coin price could be preparing for a recovery — with analysts watching key levels in their latest Trump Coin price prediction . Trump Coin Price Prediction: $500M Flood Suggests Political Catalyst Could Be Days Away TRUMP’s chart today indicates that the token may actually drop further in the next few days, before rebounding at some point next week. Its indicators show a loss of momentum this week, with its 30-period average (orange) about to fall below the 200-period average (blue), forming a ‘death cross’ that can signal further losses or even a big dump. Source: TradingView At the same time, TRUMP’s relative strength index (purple) has fallen from nearly 70 last week to 40 today, and its trajectory is still downwards. It will therefore be interesting to see whether its current support level (green) can prevent further losses in the near term, although a slight rise in trading volume today does appear to hold out hope of a quick turnaround. Volume has risen just above $500 million, suggesting a lift in demand, potentially as insiders or other large traders buy more of the coin in anticipation of some positive Trump-related news. However, to put things in some context, TRUMP’s trading volume was as high as $2.2 billion a week ago, as traders bought the coin ahead of the official dinner for token holders .

Yet this may change in the future, since as the gradual expansion of the Trump crypto empire may only be a good thing for the Trump Coin price. The second half of the year could therefore be very bullish for TRUMP, which could reach $20 by Q3, and then $50 by Q4. New Tokens With Strong Utility and Potential If TRUMP is a little too risky for some traders, they may prefer to invest in newer coins with more utility. Utility is not something that every or even most new alts have, but there are some recent examples of new coins that are showing real promise. One of these is Snorter (SNORT), a Solana- and Ethereum-based token that comes with its own helpful trading bot. Snorter has only just opened the presale for SNORT, yet it has already raised in excess of $150,000, an early sign of how big it could become. What sets Snorter part from existing trading bots is that it has been designed specifically for sniping, so that investors can trade ahead of the market and potentially make bigger profits. As such, it will enable automated trades, limit orders, MEV-resistant token swaps, copy trading, and protection against rugpulls. It’s highly comprehensive and efficient, with the SNORT token providing numerous benefits to holders, including lower fees, higher staking yields and community rewards. While its presale has only just begun, interest investors should act quickly, since its presale price will rise every few days. They can join SNORT’s sale at the Snorter website , where the token currently costs $0.0935.

2025-05-29T15:32:42.000Z,"Crypto wrap May 29: BTC holds $108K, ETH surge helps ARB, EIGEN higher","The cryptocurrency market showed a largely risk-on outlook on May 29, 2025, with altcoins trading higher as the global market cap rose to $3.44 trillion and volume spiked 6% to over $129 billion. Amid this, Bitcoin (BTC) remained near its all-time highs, trading above $108,770. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) led the altcoin charge with a notable 3% surge in 24 hours to hit highs above $2,700. This upward momentum in ETH notably sparked gains in related altcoins like Arbitrum (ARB) and EigenLayer (EIGEN). Bitcoin price steady amid tariff news On May 29, 2025, the price of Bitcoin saw a slight uptick on Thursday, trading above $108,700 after dipping to lows of $106k on May 28. BTC held at the crucial level as the crypto market turned bullish following a US court’s decision to block President Donald Trump’s tariffs. This and institutional demand for BTC, with Japan-based Metaplanet raising $21 million to bolster its Bitcoin holdings, has helped the benchmark crypto asset hold steady. Other news that has added to bullish sentiment includes GameStop’s headline acquisition of 4,710 BTC and inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum price jumps above $2,700 Ethereum surged Thursday morning, briefly trading above $2,770 and extending its rally that began in early May when it broke out from below $1,800. The move marks a gain of over 48% in the past 30 days. Analysts say ETH is likely to consolidate above the $2,700 level in the near term, with fresh momentum potentially driving the price to $3,300. The key short-term target remains $4,000, a level that could come into view if bullish sentiment persists and market conditions remain favorable. “$ETH is finally pumping,” crypto analyst Lark Davis posted on X, suggesting this spike could trigger an altcoin rally.

You know what’s coming next. 5:17 pm · 29 May 2025 293 Reply Copy link Read 99 replies ARB, EIGEN among top gainers as ETH surges Ethereum’s rally has lifted several related altcoins, with Arbitrum (ARB), EigenLayer (EIGEN), and Lido DAO (LDO) posting impressive gains. ARB, the token of Arbitrum, spiked nearly 10% before paring gains. The upside has largely benefited from network developments and optimism around Ethereum’s ecosystem. EIGEN, tied to EigenLayer’s restaking protocol, jumped 12% in 24 hours and 18% over the week. The uptick reflects increased interest in Ethereum’s layer-2 and DeFi market. Lido DAO (LDO), a liquid staking protocol, rose 8% in the last 24 hours and 14% over the past week. Which altcoins are top gainers today? Among other top gainers, Zeebec Network (ZBC) gained 32%, Status (SNT) rose 25%, and SPX6900 (SPX) surged 22%. On the downside, Sophon (SOPH) dropped 24%, and NEXPACE (NXPC) was down 12%.

2025-05-29T15:26:42.000Z,"Analyst Predicts $3K Ethereum (ETH) Milestone in June","Ethereum (ETH) is flashing bullish signals, prompting prominent market watchers to predict a surge past the $3,000 mark as early as June. The second-largest cryptocurrency is bucking broader market trends and raising hopes for a long-awaited altcoin season, thanks to sustained institutional inflows and positive technical indicators. Technical Hurdles and the $3K Target At the time of this writing, ETH was trading around $2,720, marking a modest 3.4% gain over the past 24 hours. The performance extended a broader uptrend, with the asset up 3.7% in the last seven days, 7.6% over two weeks, and just under 50% in the past month. This resilience has been in stark contrast to the global crypto market, which is down 2% in the last week, and Bitcoin (BTC), which momentarily dipped below $108,000 days after hitting its third all-time high (ATH) this cycle, amid recent market softness. While ETH’s ability to climb when its peers stalled highlights its current relative strength, analysts believe the immediate technical battle lies overhead. “Big resistance at $2.8K for now, which will be a tough level to break through quickly,” noted Daan Crypto Trades in a post on X. The cryptocurrency tested the $2,700 level twice this week before finally decisively pushing above it earlier today. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe sees this as a critical indicator: “Ethereum above $2,700 is a great sign. I think we’ll see $3,000+ in June,” he posted. Market Sentiment Points to Breakout Beyond price action, institutional demand is also turning into a handy bedrock support for ETH. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) is one of the best examples of this, scooping up over $32 million worth of the crypto asset on May 27. The fund has seen 13 consecutive trading days of inflows, accumulating about $170 million last week to push its total to $4.4 billion. “ETH Spot Premium also still solid,” observed Daan Crypto Trades. “It doesn’t have as many ETF inflows as BTC does but relative to its market cap doesn’t need nearly as much to keep the move going.” Furthermore, as reported by CoinDesk, firms like QCP Capital have described the market backdrop as a “Goldilocks zone,” with the easing of yields on long-dated U.S. and Japanese bonds calming investor nerves to create a potentially favorable environment for risk assets like crypto. The $2,800 resistance may present a near-term hurdle, but the confluence of persistent institutional buying, improving technical structure, and positive on-chain sentiment, married to a conducive macro environment, has analysts increasingly confident ETH can hit $3,000 next month.

Here Are the Details","US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen an impressive $4.26 billion in capital flows, recording 10 consecutive days of net inflows as of May 28. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is leading the rally. BlackRock’s IBIT Fund Sees Huge Interest: 10-Day Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surpass $4.2 Billion On Wednesday alone, Bitcoin ETFs saw $432.7 million in inflows, with nearly all of that coming from the IBIT fund alone, which attracted $481 million in inflows. On the other hand, Ark Invest's ARKB fund had a net outflow of $34.3 million, while Fidelity's FBTC fund had a net outflow of $14 million. There was no movement in the remaining funds. Of the net inflows in the 10-day period, 96% ($4.09 billion) were in the IBIT fund alone, with a total inflow of $45.6 billion across all funds since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. In comparison, IBIT has seen $49 billion in inflows since its launch, more than offsetting the $23.1 billion outflows in the high-fee Grayscale GBTC fund. IBIT has maintained its 33-day record of uninterrupted net inflows since April 9. During that time, only three days have closed with zero inflows. During those 33 days, the fund attracted $9.31 billion in inflows, bringing its assets under management to $72 billion. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, said, “There were inflows in 30 of the last 31 days. $9.5 billion in new capital… IBIT announced that it will be among the top 5 inflow-receiving ETFs in 2025. Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted, “IBIT is currently the 23rd largest ETF at $72 billion. This fund is only 1 year old, while the other youngest ETF in the top 25 is 12 years old.” Spot Bitcoin ETF trading volumes also remain at their peak. With Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $112,000 last week, weekly volume in ETFs has surpassed $25 billion. On Wednesday, May 28, ETFs traded a total of $3.4 billion. $2.6 billion of that came from the IBIT fund, which has a market share of nearly 80% in this metric. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs closed positive for the eighth consecutive day with net inflows of $84.9 million. BlackRock’s ETHA fund received $52.7 million, Fidelity’s FETH fund $25.7 million, Grayscale ETH $4.9 million, and Invesco QETH $1.6 million. The total trading volume of Ethereum ETFs was $446.9 million. The eight-day net inflow total reached $394.1 million. BlackRock’s IBIT fund is showing strong signs of continued institutional investor interest as it becomes a star not only in the Bitcoin ETF market but also in the general ETF league. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-29T15:12:59.000Z,"I'm Not Betting Against Trump: Initiating Trump Media With A Buy","Summary I'm initiating a buy on Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. due to its oversold technical setup and potential for a near-term bounce as sentiment stabilizes. Despite limited fundamentals and high volatility, I see the stock's current price as an attractive entry, especially with support at $19-$20. Trump Media's pivot to Bitcoin and blockchain, while risky, aligns with its core audience and could create new monetization opportunities. Valuation is speculative, but with sentiment so low, I believe a rebound is likely, and I recommend adding during the current weakness. I hereon share my sentiment on DJT stock and why I see more upside ahead. Investment thesis: Technical analysis Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. ( DJT ), President Donald Trump’s media company, has been among the worst-performing stocks after the April dip: the stock is down over 37% year to date, which is precisely why I’m initiating the stock with a buy. Technical factors drive my bullish call; with the stock leaning into oversold territory and recovering from overbought territory earlier this month, I think the stock could run, and this is looking like a nice play for the near-term. The stock also trades below all its moving averages, with EMA21 and EMA50 acting as near-term resistance at $24. I think a break above these EMAs should support a comeback. Still, the $19- $20 levels act as support, and a break below these levels risks retesting the $15 April lows (my worst-case scenario floor). With limited revenue, political uncertainty, and speculations about the latest crypto announcement, I am not betting on the company’s fundamentals just yet. All I’m saying is: the setup is ripe for a bounce as sentiment stabilizes, and investors are best positioned to enter at the current price, or around the next support lines: $19 and $20. Yahoo Finance Like Tesla ( TSLA ), this stock often trades more on hype and headlines than fundamentals, in my opinion, earning a spot as a \""meme stock.\"" While the risk of investing in such a stock is high, I think the stock presents an attractive entry point at current levels, especially after investors digest what are now considered negatives for the company. I beg to differ. So why was the stock down around 7% on Wednesday, and what negatives have been priced in? What happened last Tuesday? With Bitcoin (BTC-USD) trading near record highs, the company wants a place at the table and is borrowing a page straight from the MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) playbook, where crypto becomes the business model. Earlier this week, Trump Media announced plans to raise $2.5 billion, a sum it intends to convert into a Bitcoin reserve, from about 50 institutional investors, with $1.5 billion in common shares and $1 billion in convertible senior notes. Where others reinvest in software or platform development, this move places cryptocurrency at the heart of the company’s corporate strategy, further mirroring Trump’s goal to create a “strategic bitcoin reserve” for the U.S. government. Investors got spooked, and everyone and their grandmother turned bearish on the stock after the announcement. I made the MicroStrategy comparison, but things look a bit different for Trump Media. MicroStrategy has decades of enterprise software revenue to fall back on, but Trump Media is still in its early innings, with limited revenue and no profitability in sight. According to the form 10-Q reported in early May, the company “generated limited advertising revenue through Truth Social and no advertising revenue through our newly launched streaming operations, Truth+.” Yes, allocating a large sum to Bitcoin, an extremely volatile asset, could make matters worse and distract from building out core business functions. But I think the market is sleeping on the opportunity ahead. According to the company’s CEO, Devin Nunes, Trump Media views Bitcoin as : “an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.” Trump Media isn’t your typical media company; it’s politically driven and is built on narratives that challenge mainstream institutions. By embracing Bitcoin, the company is aligning itself with themes of financial independence, and through that, it resonates more strongly with its core audience. According to Nunes, the move will help enable crypto-based subscription payments and support the development of a Truth Social utility token (a proprietary digital currency designed for transactions within the platform’s blockchain ecosystem). Call me an optimist, but I think this gives the company a new digital economy to build around, in turn reducing reliance on traditional advertising and monetization, which have both been limited so far, as I mentioned above. Trump and Bitcoin: During his first term, Trump had a completely different sentiment on bitcoin, and called it “not money,” but things have changed drastically since then. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump became the first major U.S. candidate to accept crypto donations, and since returning to office, he has launched his own cryptocurrency, the $TRUMP meme coin. Just last week, Trump hosted a dinner at a high-end golf club in Virginia to honor 220 of the token’s top investors, while the top 25 investors enjoyed more special access. While marketed as a gesture of appreciation, the event got backlash from ethics watchdogs, claiming it highlights overlaps between Trump’s public duties and private financial interests. According to U.S . Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren in a letter to the Office of Government Ethics, \""The American people deserve the unwavering assurance that access to the presidency is not being offered for sale to the highest bidder in exchange for the President's own financial gain.” Valuation and what’s next: Valuation is through the roof, and the recent price movement is indicative of extreme speculation of the company’s latest moves rather than business fundamentals, which continue to struggle regardless. YChart The company has seen a steep valuation reset from the beginning of the year, with shares down nearly 37% so far. The company’s EV/Sales and Price/Book ratios have compressed by 41.7% and 35.4%, respectively, and its Price/Sales ratio has also dropped another 26%. This might seem like the market is “de-risking” the name, but a closer look suggests otherwise, at least in my opinion. Fortunately, the stock trades on momentum, and when sentiment bottoms out like it is now, a comeback is overdue. After repeated efforts to grow the business through more conventional means failed to yield results, Trump Media is now pivoting and embracing Bitcoin and blockchain narratives, something I think the company will reap the fruits of in the long term. Still, with a shift so drastic comes heightened investor scrutiny. Many are asking the question: Is this latest move a strategic breakthrough or just another distraction? I’m choosing to look at the glass half full, and I’m advising investors to add on the current panic.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790871-im-not-betting-against-trump-initiating-trump-media-with-a-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","TSLA|MSTR|STRF|STRK|TSLA:CA|BTC-USD|DJTWW|DJT",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T15:11:21.000Z,"Semler Scientific: Not The Ideal Bitcoin Treasury Company","Summary Semler Scientific's pivot to a Bitcoin treasury strategy has been successful. However, competition in the Bitcoin Treasury company space is heating up, including many well funded competitors. Declining revenues and free cash flow in its healthcare business are concerning, and Bitcoin is materially outperforming the Company year to date. Introduction Per its website , Semler Scientific, Inc. ( SMLR ) (the \"" Company \"") \""develops, manufactures and markets innovative products and services that support the early detection and treatment of chronic diseases.\"" QuantaFlo® is its patented product; namely, an \""FDA-cleared point-of-care product that measures arterial blood flow in the extremities and provides results in a matter of minutes.\"" A mediocre health care company, in May 2024 , the Company shifted its strategy and focus to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) (\"" Bitcoin \""), becoming a so called Bitcoin treasury company (a \"" BTC Treasury Co. \""). And with its healthcare business seemingly riddled with regulatory issues , recent guidance from management suggests that the Company will focus even more on Bitcoin going forward, including raising lots of capital to aggressively accumulate more Bitcoin. This article will focus upon the Company's fitness as a BTC Treasury Co. While the Company's stock price should do well if Bitcoin keeps rising, I currently consider the Company a HOLD. The reasons for the HOLD rating include 1) increased competition in the BTC Treasury Co. space, including MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), Metaplanet Inc. , privately held Twenty One Capital, several crypto miners and Asset Entities Ltd. ( ASST ), among others, and 2) the simplicity of owning Bitcoin outright compared to owning the Company's stock, particularly when the Company's healthcare operations are not currently generating positive free cash flow. Financial Strength and Related Matters The ideal BTC Treasury Co. would have an easy to understand underlying business that generates lots of free cash flow. Said BTC Treasury Co. could then plough that excess cash flow back into the acquisition of more Bitcoin, without diluting shareholders . In the case of the Company, however, its underlying business operations are not currently throwing off free cash flow. Excluding the \""Change in fair value of digital assets\"" line item on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows, net cash provided by operations for the periods ended March 31, 2025 , March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were as follows: (In Thousands of $) March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Net Cash Provided by Operations (1,906) 5,624 861 Minus the Increase in Change in fair value of digital assets 41,829 -- -- Total Cash from Operations (43,435) 5,624 861 Source: 10Qs for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2023 (links in the above paragraph); table created by Author. The above table shows that the Company's underlying healthcare business is currently burning through cash. Unsurprisingly, at only $8.8 million, revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025 experienced a 44% year over year decline. On top declining operating revenues, the Company's regulatory controls relating to its underlying healthcare business are questionable in light of a recent settlement with the Department of Justice . The settlement requires the Company to pay a nearly $30 million fine. The Company will finance the settlement payment with a loan from Coinbase Global Inc. ( COIN ). The Company's Bitcoin will secure the loan. Basic metrics of the Company's financial strength, such as the current ratio are also declining. (In Thousands of $) March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Total Current Assets $18,452 $71,905 $55,592 Total Current Liabilities 35,667 5,903 8,918 Current Ratio 0.52 12.18 6.23 Source: 10Qs for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 (linked above), March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 (linked above); table created by Author. Of course, the Company has been leveraging its balance sheet to buy more Bitcoin , in addition to funding the healthcare business. As such, the current ratio may not be the most helpful way to assess the financial strength of the Company. Nonetheless, the low current ratio, coupled with the negative cash flow, signal that the Company is risky relative to owning Bitcoin outright. In a large Bitcoin drawdown, the Company may have to sell Bitcoin at a low price (i.e., at the wrong time) in order to fund operations, service its debt and pay trade creditors. In light of the above described backdrop, it comes as no surprise to me that Bitcoin is outperforming the Company year-to-date (through May 23rd) by a wide margin, as shown in the chart below. Seeking Alpha Notably, the Company's stock is trading around $44 as of the time of writing, well below its 52-week high of $81.56, while Bitcoin is trading near all-time highs ($110,211 at the time of writing). Investors should also be aware that during the December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2025 period, outstanding common shares have increased from roughly 7.1 million to 9.8 million, a nearly 40% gain in shares outstanding. In isolation, the dilution is problem for shareholders; however, the Company does seem to be adding value here as the Bitcoin Yield has increased by 22.2% year to date. Risks In addition to the risks embedded in the discussion above, other risks of the Company are included or referenced below. As a constituent of the Russell 2000 Index, the Company is not the beneficiary of the same level of passive capital inflows that accrue to constituents of larger and more popular equity indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100. When everything is about flows, this could prove a competitive disadvantage for the Company, particularly if other BTC Treasury Co.'s are the beneficiaries of inclusion in larger indexes. More automatic capital inflows will generally mean a lower cost of capital. Increased competition (discussed below) for such passive flows could have an adverse effect on the Company. Competition in the BTC Treasury Co. space is growing. New entrants to the space may be better funded and have better business models than the Company. For example, the recently formed Twenty One Capital aims to compete with MicroStrategy and recently acquired more than $450 million of Bitcoin. Japanese company, Metaplanet , is growing rapidly. Several bitcoin miners have issued debt and/or equity to acquire more Bitcoin. Moreover, Asset Entities, Inc. ( ASST ) is converting to a BTC Treasury Co. with its reverse merger with Strive Asset Management, and the newly combined company has novel ideas on how to accumulate more Bitcoin. The Company's healthcare business is highly regulated and failure to comply with applicable regulations can result in material fines and penalties, an example of which was referenced earlier in the article. Other risks of owning share in the Company are outlined in the Company's most recent 10K (starting on page 2 thereof).

2025-05-29T15:10:08.000Z,"Bitcoin: Smarter Web Company’s Bold Move Boosts Corporate Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Smarter Web Company’s Bold Move Boosts Corporate Holdings In the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, a significant development has emerged from London. The Smarter Web Company, a technology firm listed on the London stock exchange, recently made headlines with a notable increase in its Bitcoin holdings. This move isn’t just a simple transaction; it signals a growing trend among publicly traded companies to allocate a portion of their balance sheets to digital currencies. The company announced via an official statement that it has acquired an additional 24.53 BTC, a decision that brings its total Company Bitcoin Holdings to an impressive 83.24 BTC. Why are Companies Like The Smarter Web Company Buying Bitcoin? This question is on the minds of many investors and market observers. While traditional finance often views cryptocurrencies with caution, a growing number of corporations are starting to see Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic reserve. Several factors are driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, companies are looking for assets that can potentially preserve or grow value over the long term, unlike cash which may lose purchasing power. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and fixed supply (capped at 21 million coins) position it as a potential digital store of value, often compared to digital gold. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets away from traditional financial instruments like cash, bonds, and equities. Balance Sheet Strategy: For some companies, holding Bitcoin aligns with a forward-thinking strategy, embracing emerging technologies and potentially signaling innovation to investors. Potential Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns on corporate capital. For a technology firm like The Smarter Web Company , holding Bitcoin could also be seen as an extension of their core business – engaging with cutting-edge digital advancements and the future of finance. What Does This Acquisition Mean for Their Company Bitcoin Holdings? Adding 24.53 BTC is a substantial acquisition for The Smarter Web Company. Moving from 58.71 BTC to 83.24 BTC represents an increase of over 40%. While this figure might seem modest compared to giants like MicroStrategy, which holds tens of thousands of Bitcoin , it’s significant for a company of The Smarter Web Company’s size and profile. It demonstrates a reinforced conviction in their initial strategy and a willingness to increase their exposure to the asset class. Their total of 83.24 BTC solidifies their position among publicly listed companies that have allocated capital to cryptocurrencies. It places them in a category of firms actively exploring alternative treasury management strategies in the digital age. The value of these Company Bitcoin Holdings will fluctuate with the market, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Is This Part of a Larger Trend in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Absolutely. The move by The Smarter Web Company is not an isolated incident but rather a piece of a much larger puzzle indicating increasing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption globally. Companies across various sectors, from technology and payments to manufacturing, have publicly announced purchases of Bitcoin for their balance sheets. Pioneers in this space include: MicroStrategy: Arguably the most vocal proponent, holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Tesla: Briefly held significant Bitcoin, though they later sold a portion, their initial purchase highlighted the asset’s potential to a mainstream audience. Block (formerly Square): A payment processing company that has made strategic investments in Bitcoin and is actively involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Other Public Companies: A growing list of smaller and mid-cap companies are quietly adding Bitcoin to their reserves. This trend signifies a maturation of the asset class and a growing acceptance by traditional corporate structures. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is moving from being a fringe idea to a recognized, albeit still debated, treasury management strategy. What are the Implications of Institutional Crypto Investment? The involvement of publicly traded companies like The Smarter Web Company falls under the umbrella of Institutional Crypto Investment . When institutions, whether corporations, asset managers, or hedge funds, begin allocating significant capital to cryptocurrencies, it has several profound implications: Increased Legitimacy: Institutional interest lends credibility to the cryptocurrency market, helping to dispel the notion that it’s solely for retail investors or illicit activities. Greater Market Liquidity: Large institutional trades can add significant volume and liquidity to exchanges. Potential for Reduced Volatility: While still volatile, increased institutional holding for long-term treasury purposes could potentially contribute to a more stable market over time compared to purely speculative trading. Regulatory Scrutiny: As institutional involvement grows, so does the attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to clearer guidelines and frameworks. Product Development: Growing institutional demand spurs the development of regulated investment products and services catering to these entities. Institutional Crypto Investment is a key driver pushing the crypto market towards mainstream financial integration. What are the Potential Benefits and Risks for Companies Holding Bitcoin? Like any investment, holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet comes with its own set of potential benefits and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: The possibility of substantial returns if the price of Bitcoin increases significantly over the holding period. Inflation Protection: As discussed, a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Balance Sheet Strength (in a bull market): Increased asset value can improve the look of a company’s balance sheet. Attracting Investors: Some investors are specifically looking for companies with exposure to the digital asset space. Potential Risks: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods, potentially leading to significant paper losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving and varies by jurisdiction. Accounting Challenges: Under current accounting rules (like GAAP or IFRS), Bitcoin is often treated as an intangible asset subject to impairment testing, meaning companies must report a loss if the price drops below their cost basis, even if they haven’t sold. They cannot report gains until they sell. Security Risks: Holding and securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Reputational Risk: Negative market sentiment or regulatory issues could impact the company’s public image. Companies considering this path, like The Smarter Web Company , must carefully weigh these factors and have a clear strategy for managing their exposure. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Balance Sheets? The decision by The Smarter Web Company to increase its Company Bitcoin Holdings is a strong indicator that the trend of corporate adoption is likely to continue. As the digital asset market matures and regulatory clarity potentially improves, more companies may explore adding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets. This could reshape traditional corporate finance, making digital assets a more common component of treasury management alongside cash, bonds, and other traditional investments. The success or challenges faced by early adopters like The Smarter Web Company will likely influence the pace and scale of future Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . While the path forward is not without its hurdles, the continued movement of publicly traded companies into the crypto space suggests a long-term shift in how corporate value and treasury management are perceived in the digital economy. This growing interest from entities involved in Institutional Crypto Investment underscores the increasing integration of digital assets into the global financial system. In conclusion, The Smarter Web Company’s decision to boost its Bitcoin reserves to 83.24 BTC is more than just a company announcement; it’s a microcosm of the broader, accelerating trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption and Institutional Crypto Investment . It highlights the strategic considerations companies are making in response to macroeconomic pressures and the potential of digital assets. As more firms follow suit, the line between traditional finance and the crypto world will continue to blur, potentially paving the way for a new era of corporate treasury management.

U.S. spot ether ETFs logged an estimated $84 million in net inflows on May 28, as investor interest held firm even with ether falling 1.3%, the bank said in a report published on Thursday. Leading the pack was BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which brought in $52 million, followed by Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) with $26 million. Grayscale’s mini ETH Trust and Invesco/Galaxy’s QETH added $5 million and $2 million, respectively, the bank noted. Notably, ether ETFs recorded a notional trading volume of $459 million, well above their post-launch daily average of approximately $375 million since debuting in July 2024 , the bank observed. Meanwhile, spot bitcoin ETFs brought in an estimated $431 million in net inflows, JPMorgan said, largely powered by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which alone saw $479 million in new investment. The strong inflow was partially offset by redemptions from ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), the bank noted, which shed $34 million, and Fidelity’s FBTC, which recorded $14 million in outflows. Despite bitcoin's 2.1% drop in price, total trading volumes remained elevated, clocking in at $3.5 billion, compared to the group’s historical average of $2.8 billion per day since launching in January 2024, the report added. Investors are moving from gold to bitcoin ETFs, according to a Thursday report by Bloomberg. U.S. bitcoin ETFs have seen $9 billion in inflows over the last 5 weeks versus $2.8 billion in outflows for gold-backed funds.

Scheduled for release in early 2026, the machine offers an energy efficiency of 9.7 joules per terahash (J/TH), a new benchmark in mining technology. For context, the first dedicated bitcoin ASIC miner launched in 2013 consumed roughly 1,200 J/TH. But while the S23 Hydro represents a leap forward in hardware design, it arrives at a time of tension in the mining economy, analysts at TheMinerMag wrote in a Thursday report. In past market cycles, major efficiency upgrades were timed with bear markets, giving miners a head start ahead of bitcoin halving events. This launch breaks that pattern: bitcoin recently surged past $100,000, but miner profitability hasn’t kept pace. The core issue is hashprice, the analysts said. Despite the rally, hashprice has remained low, dipping below $39/PH/s earlier this year. Facing smaller and smaller margins, several large firms have paused hashrate expansion plans. Instead of fueling network expansion, the S23 Hydro and similar rigs may be used to upgrade existing fleets. That’s a notable shift. As older models get retired, the overall power efficiency of the Bitcoin network could improve — possibly even reducing total power consumption, a first in the protocol’s history. The new machine’s launch signals a new era where efficiency gains are about surviving squeezed margins, not just chasing growth. If hashprice doesn’t recover to pre-2024 halving levels of around $100/PH/s, miners could face steeper headwinds in future downturns. The Antminer S23 Hydro may be cutting-edge, but the economic terrain it enters is more uncertain than ever.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/29/bitmains-new-antminer-launch-signals-profound-shift-for-bitcoin-miners-theminermag,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin Mining|Bitmain|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto for Advisors: Crypto Universe","In today’s Crypto for Advisors, Fabian Dori , Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum Bank , explores why crypto is more than just an asset class and looks at the institutional adoption of decentralized finance. Then, Abhishek Pingle , co-founder of Theo , answers questions about how risk-adverse investors can approach decentralized finance and what to look for in Ask an Expert. – Sarah Morton Unknown block type \""divider\"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Crypto Is Not an Asset Class — It's an Asset Universe Moody's recently warned that public blockchains pose a risk to institutional investors. At the same time, U.S. bitcoin ETFs are drawing billions in inflows. We’re seeing the start of a long-awaited shift in institutional adoption. But crypto's real potential lies far beyond passive bitcoin exposure. It's not just an asset class — it's an asset universe, spanning yield-generating strategies, directional plays, and hedge fund-style alpha. Most institutions are only scratching the surface of what's possible. Institutional investors may enhance their risk-return profile by moving beyond a monolithic view of crypto and recognizing three distinct segments: yield-generating strategies, directional investments, and alternative strategies. Like traditional fixed income, yield-generating strategies offer limited market risk with low volatility. Typical strategies range from tokenized money market funds that earn traditional yields to approaches engaging with the decentralized crypto finance ecosystem, which deliver attractive returns without traditional duration or credit risk. These crypto yield strategies may boast attractive Sharpe ratios, rivalling high-yield bonds' risk premia but with different mechanics. For example, returns can be earned from protocol participation, lending and borrowing activities, funding rate arbitrage strategies, and liquidity provisioning. Unlike bonds that face principal erosion in rising rate environments, many crypto yield strategies function largely independently of central bank policy and provide genuine portfolio diversification precisely when it's most needed. However, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Crypto yield strategies entail risks, mainly centered around the maturity and security of the protocols and platforms a strategy engages with. The path to institutional adoption typically follows three distinct approaches aligned with different investor profiles: Risk-averse institutions begin with yield-generating strategies that limit direct market exposure while capturing attractive returns. These entry points enable traditional investors to benefit from the unique yields available in the crypto ecosystem without incurring the volatility associated with directional exposure. Mainstream institutions often adopt a bitcoin-first approach before gradually diversifying into other assets. Starting with bitcoin provides a familiar narrative and established regulatory clarity before expanding into more complex strategies and assets. Sophisticated players like family offices and specialized asset managers explore the entire crypto ecosystem from the outset and build comprehensive strategies that leverage the full range of opportunities across the risk spectrum. Contrary to early industry predictions, tokenization is progressing from liquid assets like stablecoins and money market funds upward, driven by liquidity and familiarity, not promises of democratizing illiquid assets. More complex assets are following suit, revealing a pragmatic adoption curve. Moody's caution about protocol risk exceeding traditional counterparty risk deserves scrutiny. This narrative may deter institutions from crypto's yield layer, yet it highlights only one side of the coin. While blockchain-based assets introduce technical risks, these risks are often transparent and auditable, unlike the potentially opaque risk profiles of counterparties in traditional finance. Smart contracts, for example, offer new levels of transparency. Their code can be audited, stress-tested, and verified independently. This means risk assessment can be conducted with fewer assumptions and greater precision than financial institutions with off-balance-sheet exposures. Major decentralized finance platforms now undergo multiple independent audits and maintain significant insurance reserves. They have, at least partially, mitigated risks in the public blockchain environment that Moody's warned against. While tokenization doesn't eliminate the inherent counterparty risk associated with the underlying assets, blockchain technology provides a more efficient and resilient infrastructure for accessing them. Ultimately, institutional investors should apply traditional investment principles to these novel asset classes while acknowledging the vast array of opportunities within digital assets. The question isn't whether to allocate to crypto but rather which specific segments of the crypto asset universe align with particular portfolio objectives and risk tolerances. Institutional investors are well-positioned to develop tailored allocation strategies that leverage the unique characteristics of different segments of the crypto ecosystem. - Fabian Dori, chief investment officer, Sygnum Bank Unknown block type \""divider\"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ask an Expert Q: What yield-generating strategies are institutions using on-chain today? A: The most promising strategies are delta-neutral, meaning they are neutral to price movements. This includes arbitrage between centralized and decentralized exchanges, capturing funding rates, and short-term lending across fragmented liquidity pools. These generate net yields of 7–15% without wider market exposure. Q: What structural features of DeFi enable more efficient capital deployment compared to traditional finance? A: We like to think of decentralized finance (DeFi) as “on-chain markets”. On-chain markets unlock capital efficiency by removing intermediaries, enabling programmable strategies, and offering real-time access to on-chain data. Unlike traditional finance, where capital often sits idle due to batch processing, counterparty delays, or opaque systems, on-chain markets provide a world where liquidity can be routed dynamically across protocols based on quantifiable risk and return metrics. Features like composability and permissionless access enable assets to be deployed, rebalanced, or withdrawn in real-time, often with automated safeguards. This architecture supports strategies that are both agile and transparent, particularly important for institutions that optimize across fragmented liquidity pools or manage volatility exposure. Q: How should a risk-averse institution approach yield on-chain? A: Many institutions exploring DeFi take a cautious first step by evaluating stablecoin-based, non-directional strategies, as explained above, that aim to offer consistent yields with limited market exposure. These approaches are often framed around capital preservation and transparency, with infrastructure that supports on-chain risk monitoring, customizable guardrails, and secure custody. For firms seeking yield diversification without the duration risk of traditional fixed income, these strategies are gaining traction as a conservative entry point into on-chain markets. - Abhishek Pingle, co-founder, Theo Unknown block type \""divider\"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Keep Reading Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,878 last week.

2025-05-29T14:59:14.000Z,"Peter Schiff Calls Bitcoin a 'Giant Cult,' Doubles Down on Gold","Peter Schiff, one of Bitcoin’s most vocal critics, took the stage at the Bitcoin 2025 conference on Thursday and didn’t hold back. During a fiery conversation with journalist Natalie Brunell at the Venetian Convention Center in Las Vegas, the longtime gold advocate dismissed the Bitcoin BTC community as “a giant cult” and said the digital asset resembles a “memecoin.” Schiff, who rose to prominence as a stockbroker and gold bug, has long argued that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. On stage, he reiterated that claim and pointed to global central banks still accumulating gold — not bitcoin — as evidence that gold remains the true reserve asset. “Every time I tell people not to buy bitcoin, they buy more,” he quipped. “I’m probably responsible for more people owning bitcoin than anyone else at this conference.” His comments came in response to U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, who said earlier that day that bitcoin had created “unparalleled wealth” over the last decade. Schiff pushed back, arguing that the wealth generated by the crypto asset doesn’t represent value creation but rather a transfer of wealth from latecomers to early adopters. “It’s a pyramid structure,” he said, “not innovation.” While the crowd responded with a mix of laughter and groans, Schiff stayed on message: bitcoin’s price, he said, is propelled by hype, not economic fundamentals. The jab stood in contrast to the rest of the week’s festivities, where many speakers celebrated bitcoin’s growing institutional acceptance and financial footprint.

The findings contradict Michael Saylor’s warnings about disclosing wallet addresses due to security risks. Strategy has slowed its Bitcoin purchases as MSTR’s premium shrinks and competition in corporate BTC holdings grows. Arkham Intelligence has linked over $7.6 billion worth of Bitcoin to Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy. In a recent post , the blockchain analytics firm claimed to have identified wallet addresses holding 70,816 BTC tied to the company, despite public resistance from its co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor, to disclose such information. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did,” Arkham wrote. Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Now Pegged at $54.5B, Says Arkham If the data is accurate, the new wallets bring Strategy’s total identified Bitcoin holdings to $54.5 billion, representing around 87.5% of the firm’s total BTC reserves, according to Arkham’s analysis. The revelation directly counters Saylor’s recent remarks at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, where he warned against exposing wallet addresses. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth,” Saylor said. He argued that transparency of wallet activity creates long-term vulnerabilities, including transaction tracing and predictive behavioral analytics. Saylor further suggested using AI to simulate attack scenarios, warning that the technology could generate “50 pages” of potential risks just from the exposure of wallet addresses alone.

Arkham’s findings come amid heightened scrutiny over its wallet-labeling methods, with past allegations of misidentification—such as those from Mantra CEO John Mullin, who denied Arkham’s claims during the platform’s token collapse. Strategy Slows Bitcoin Buys as MSTR Premium Shrinks Strategy appears to be easing its pace of Bitcoin acquisitions, according to a report from K33 Research . The company, led by co-founder Michael Saylor, remains the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin, but its recent purchase cadence has cooled compared to the frenzied buying seen last November. In its latest filing, Strategy revealed it bought 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for $427.1 million, using proceeds from its ongoing $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering. However, capital raised from the program has slowed. Only $348.7 million was deployed during that week, down from $705.7 million the week prior and $1.31 billion in early May. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributes the deceleration to two key factors: a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, and intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. Meanwhile, Jeff Walton, an analyst at Strategy, has said the firm may one day rise to become the top publicly traded company in the world. Walton believes the company’s unprecedented exposure to Bitcoin, which recently crossed $111,000, gives it a unique edge.

2025-05-29T14:50:59.000Z,"UK Government Declares Firm ‘No’ to Bitcoin Reserves Amid Volatility Fears","BitcoinWorld UK Government Declares Firm ‘No’ to Bitcoin Reserves Amid Volatility Fears In a significant announcement that clarifies the United Kingdom’s official stance on digital assets at the highest level, the UK government has definitively ruled out integrating Bitcoin into its national strategic reserves. This decision, primarily driven by concerns over the inherent volatility of the leading cryptocurrency, was confirmed by Member of Parliament Emma Reynolds, according to reports originating from Cointelegraph on X. For those closely following the intersection of traditional finance, government policy, and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, this statement provides crucial clarity. While many nations and institutions are exploring various roles for digital assets, the UK is taking a cautious approach when it comes to managing national wealth. Why is the UK Government Avoiding Bitcoin Reserves? The primary reason cited by MP Emma Reynolds for the UK’s decision is cryptocurrency volatility . Strategic reserves, particularly foreign exchange reserves, are managed with core principles focused on stability, liquidity, and capital preservation. These reserves are typically held in stable, widely accepted assets like major fiat currencies (USD, EUR, JPY), gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Bitcoin, known for its rapid and often unpredictable price swings, is seen as fundamentally incompatible with these objectives. Governments hold reserves for various critical purposes: To manage exchange rates and support the national currency. To provide liquidity in times of economic crisis. To diversify national assets (though stability is paramount here). To maintain confidence in the country’s financial stability. Introducing an asset like Bitcoin, which can experience double-digit percentage price changes in a single day, could introduce unacceptable levels of risk and uncertainty into a portfolio designed for stability. Understanding Strategic Reserves: What Are They and Why Do They Matter? Strategic reserves are a nation’s assets held by its central bank or monetary authority. They are crucial tools for economic stability and national security. The most common type is foreign exchange reserves, which are holdings of foreign currencies, gold, and other highly liquid assets. Think of them as a nation’s emergency fund and financial toolkit. They allow a government to intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilize its currency, pay for essential imports during crises, service foreign debts, and generally project financial strength and credibility on the global stage. The management of these reserves is typically conservative. The focus is on preserving capital and ensuring liquidity, not on speculative growth. This fundamental principle is why assets with extreme volatility, like Bitcoin, are deemed unsuitable by many central bankers and finance ministries globally. Who is Emma Reynolds and What is Her Role? Emma Reynolds is a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom. Her statement, while potentially reflecting the government’s broader position, provides insight into the thinking within parliamentary circles regarding digital assets and their potential role in national finance. While the original source points to her confirmation of the decision, it’s important to note that official government policy statements typically come from the Treasury or the Bank of England. However, a confirmation from an MP like Reynolds, especially if connected to relevant committees or discussions, carries weight in understanding the prevailing sentiment and policy direction within the UK government . Comparing Traditional Reserve Assets vs. Bitcoin Let’s look at how traditional reserve assets stack up against Bitcoin in the context of national reserves: Feature Traditional Reserve Assets (e.g., USD, Gold) Bitcoin Volatility Relatively Low (compared to Bitcoin) Extremely High Liquidity Very High (easily bought/sold in large volumes) High, but market depth can vary; large transactions can impact price Acceptance Globally accepted by central banks and governments Increasing, but not universally accepted by governments as a reserve Regulatory Status Well-defined and regulated globally Varies significantly by jurisdiction; regulatory landscape is evolving Storage/Security Established, secure systems (vaults, central bank accounts) Requires digital security (private keys), susceptible to hacks if not managed perfectly Correlation Often uncorrelated or negatively correlated with certain risks Correlation with tech stocks and risk-on assets observed; behavior in a global financial crisis is untested This comparison highlights the core conflict: the very characteristics that make Bitcoin attractive to some investors (potential for high returns, decentralization) are precisely what make it problematic for conservative strategic reserves management. Could This Stance Change in the Future? While the current position is clear, the world of finance and technology is constantly evolving. Several factors could potentially influence the UK government ‘s stance in the distant future, although there’s no indication this is imminent: Maturation of the Crypto Market: As the market grows, regulation becomes clearer, and institutional participation increases, cryptocurrency volatility *might* decrease over very long timeframes, though this is speculative. Development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): While different from Bitcoin, the successful implementation and widespread use of CBDCs by major economies could normalize the idea of digital assets in central banking. Global Adoption by Other Nations: If other major economies were to successfully integrate Bitcoin or similar assets into their reserves (a highly unlikely scenario given current principles), it could force a reconsideration. Fundamental Shift in Reserve Management Philosophy: A global economic paradigm shift might lead central banks to prioritize different characteristics in their reserves. However, based on the current understanding of macroeconomics, financial stability, and the role of reserves, a shift towards including volatile assets like Bitcoin seems highly improbable in the foreseeable future. The statement attributed to Emma Reynolds solidifies this current perspective. Challenges Beyond Volatility While volatility is the primary concern, holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset presents other challenges for a government: Security: Managing private keys for vast sums of Bitcoin requires extremely robust and novel security protocols, different from securing physical gold or traditional bank accounts. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still fragmented and evolving. Lack of Yield: Unlike some traditional assets, Bitcoin does not inherently generate interest or dividends. Public Perception & Political Risk: A government holding a highly speculative asset could face significant public and political backlash if its value plummeted. These factors further reinforce the conservative approach taken by the UK government regarding Bitcoin reserves . Actionable Insight: What Does This Mean for Investors? For individual or institutional investors, the UK’s stance doesn’t necessarily dictate personal investment strategy. However, it serves as a reminder of how different entities view and manage risk. Governments, responsible for national economic stability, prioritize capital preservation and liquidity above all else in their reserves. Investors with different risk tolerances and objectives may view Bitcoin differently. The key takeaway is understanding the *why* behind the government’s decision: cryptocurrency volatility is fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of strategic reserves . This doesn’t invalidate Bitcoin as an asset class for others, but it clearly defines its current limitations in official government finance. Conclusion: A Clear Signal from the UK The confirmation from MP Emma Reynolds that the UK government has no plans to hold Bitcoin reserves sends a clear signal. It underscores the traditional, conservative approach the UK takes towards managing its national wealth and ensuring financial stability. The inherent cryptocurrency volatility of Bitcoin is seen as a fundamental barrier to its inclusion in assets designed for security and liquidity. While the crypto landscape continues to evolve, this decision highlights the significant gap that still exists between decentralized digital assets and the established principles governing national economic security.

2025-05-29T14:40:53.000Z,"Bitcoin Price: Analyst Reveals Why Crypto Market Isn’t Overheating Despite Profit-Taking","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Analyst Reveals Why Crypto Market Isn’t Overheating Despite Profit-Taking Are we witnessing the early signs of a market top, or is there still room to run? This is the question on many investors’ minds as they watch the recent price action in the Bitcoin price . While some indicators might suggest caution, a closer look at on-chain data provides a more nuanced picture. According to crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., while Bitcoin short-term holders are indeed realizing profits, the broader market conditions indicate we are far from a state of overheating. Understanding Bitcoin Profit Taking and Market Cycles In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, understanding investor behavior is crucial for effective crypto market analysis . One key behavior is profit-taking, which is when holders sell assets after their value has increased to lock in gains. This is a natural part of any market cycle. For Bitcoin, analysts often segment holders into ‘short-term holders’ (STHs) and ‘long-term holders’ (LTHs) based on how long they’ve held their coins (typically less than 155 days for STHs). Short-term holders are often considered more reactive to recent price movements. When the price rises, they are more likely to sell to take profits, especially if they bought relatively recently at lower prices. Conversely, they might sell at a loss if the price drops below their purchase price. Market cycles in crypto are characterized by periods of accumulation, rapid price appreciation (often fueled by retail and short-term holder activity), distribution (profit-taking), and eventual correction or consolidation. Identifying where we are in this cycle is key to predicting future movements. What Does the Bitcoin SOPR Indicator Tell Us? To measure whether holders are selling at a profit or loss, on-chain analysts use metrics like the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The SOPR is calculated by dividing the realized value (price at the time of spending) by the value at creation (price at the time of acquisition) for all spent outputs. An SOPR value greater than 1 indicates that coins are being sold at a profit on average, while a value less than 1 indicates they are being sold at a loss. Specifically, the Bitcoin SOPR for Short-Term Holders (STH-SOPR) focuses only on coins held for less than 155 days. This metric is particularly useful for gauging the sentiment and behavior of newer market participants and those who are more actively trading. STH-SOPR > 1: STHs are selling coins that are, on average, in profit. STH-SOPR STHs are selling coins that are, on average, in loss. STH-SOPR = 1: STHs are breaking even on average. A rising STH-SOPR suggests increased profit-taking among this cohort, which can be a signal of increasing selling pressure. However, the *level* the SOPR reaches is crucial for context. Recent STH Profit Taking: A Signal of Caution? Axel Adler Jr. highlighted that the 30-day moving average of the BTC STH-SOPR has recently reached a local high. This confirms that Bitcoin profit taking among short-term holders has seen a surge. This is a natural reaction to recent positive price movements. As Bitcoin’s value increases, investors who bought in the last few months see their investments turn profitable and decide to cash out some or all of their gains. This behavior is expected and, to some extent, healthy for the market as it allows new capital to enter and prevents parabolic, unsustainable rises. However, excessive profit-taking can lead to significant selling pressure and potential price corrections. Why the Market Isn’t Overheating Yet, According to the Analyst Despite the uptick in Bitcoin short-term holders realizing profits, Axel Adler Jr. emphasizes that the market is not yet showing signs of being ‘overheated’. This assessment is based on comparing the current level of the STH-SOPR to levels seen during previous major market peaks. In past bull market tops, the STH-SOPR has typically reached much higher, ‘euphoric’ levels. These are periods where almost all STHs are sitting on significant profits and are aggressively selling into strong demand. The current STH-SOPR, while elevated locally, has not reached those historical peak levels that signal widespread euphoria and potential market exhaustion. Furthermore, the analyst noted that crypto demand remains robust. This strong demand helps absorb the selling pressure from profit-taking STHs, preventing a sharp price decline and indicating underlying market strength. Robust demand can come from various sources, including: Increased retail investor interest. Continued institutional adoption (e.g., via ETFs). Growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) or other crypto ecosystems. Macroeconomic factors driving interest in alternative assets. The combination of profit-taking that is significant but not yet euphoric, alongside strong underlying demand, suggests a market that is consolidating or taking a breather rather than one on the verge of a major collapse due to excessive speculation and overextension. Key Takeaways for Your Crypto Market Analysis What does this mean for investors conducting their own crypto market analysis ? Here are some actionable insights: Profit-taking is normal: Don’t panic simply because STHs are selling for profit. It’s a healthy part of the market cycle. Context is key: The *level* of profit-taking matters. The STH-SOPR provides valuable context. Compare current levels to historical peaks. Demand matters: Strong demand can absorb selling pressure. Look for other indicators of market health and capital inflow. On-chain data is powerful: Metrics like SOPR offer insights into holder behavior that price charts alone cannot provide. Stay informed: Follow analysis from reputable sources like Axel Adler Jr. who utilize these advanced metrics. While the recent uptick in Bitcoin profit taking by short-term holders warrants attention, the analysis suggests it is not indicative of an immediate market top. The lack of euphoric STH-SOPR levels and the presence of robust demand paint a picture of a market that is absorbing supply effectively, potentially setting the stage for further sustainable growth rather than an imminent crash. Looking Ahead: What Could Change This Outlook? While the current analysis suggests no immediate overheating, market conditions can change rapidly. Investors should monitor key factors such as: Factor Potential Impact Significant increase in STH-SOPR to euphoric levels Increased risk of market top and correction Sudden drop in demand Selling pressure from profit-taking could overwhelm buying Major macroeconomic shifts Could impact investor sentiment and capital flows Regulatory developments Can introduce uncertainty and volatility Remaining vigilant and combining on-chain analysis with other forms of market research is essential for navigating the complexities of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Balanced Perspective on Bitcoin’s Current State The recent data showing Bitcoin short-term holders taking profits is a natural development following positive price movements. However, relying solely on this observation can lead to premature conclusions. By incorporating sophisticated on-chain metrics like the Bitcoin SOPR and considering the broader context of market demand, analysts can provide a more balanced perspective. Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis suggests that despite the increased selling from STHs, the market has not reached the speculative frenzy characteristic of previous tops. Robust demand continues to provide a solid foundation, suggesting that the current phase is more likely a healthy consolidation or mid-cycle pause rather than the beginning of the end for this market uptrend.

Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin needs to print new all-time highs or the flagship crypto asset may flip bearish. “If we don’t get further highs soon, BTC will be setting up for bearish divergences on longer range charts at a time when capital inflows have been weaker than normal with speculation running too hot. If that happens we will need to wear out another wave of profit taking.” However, the analyst says that the Bitcoin Risk Signal, which gauges whether BTC is at risk of a major drawdown in price, is flashing bullish, and possibly setting the flagship crypto asset up to print new all-time highs this week. “Still, the broader picture is bullish with the risk signal dropping. If buying follows through this week, $114,000 is next in line to liquidate shorts. But right now there’s an opening for a bearish pivot.” Source: Willy Woo/X Woo also points out a concerning trend that Bitcoin’s spent output profit ratio (SOPR), which tracks whether coins are being sold at a profit or loss, indicates investors are sitting on substantial profits, suggesting they may be inclined to sell at any sign of a downturn. “Speculation is going nuts on BTC at a time when there’s plenty of investor profits to take (SOPR). Reminds me of ‘be fearful when others are greedy.’ A lot comes down to how much buying happens this week when US markets open after a long weekend.” Source: Willy Woo/X Lastly, Woo says that investors buying Bitcoin has slowed for the first time since its massive breakout to new all-time highs, suggesting the potential for a bearish reversal. “Capital flows into the network was very flat the last three days.

2025-05-29T14:30:11.000Z,"Spectacular BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Strong Institutional Adoption","BitcoinWorld Spectacular BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Strong Institutional Adoption Are you following the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’ve likely noticed the significant impact that regulated investment products are having. Among these, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF , known by its ticker IBIT, is making waves with its consistent performance and substantial asset accumulation. What’s Driving the Massive IBIT Inflows? Recent data highlights a remarkable trend for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. Following a notable $482 million net inflow on May 28th, industry observers pointed out just how consistent IBIT’s performance has been. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, a U.S.-based wealth management firm, shared insights on this impressive run. According to Geraci, IBIT has recorded inflows on 30 out of the past 31 trading days. This isn’t just a fleeting moment of interest; it represents sustained demand. This consistent influx of capital positions IBIT as a major player in the ETF landscape, far beyond just the crypto space. Consistent Performance: Inflows on 30 of the last 31 trading days. Significant Daily Inflows: Averaging around $430 million recently. Total Recent Accumulation: $3.86 billion over the past two weeks. How Does This Rank Among All ETFs? The scale of these Bitcoin ETF inflows is particularly noteworthy when viewed against the broader ETF market. Nate Geraci emphasized that IBIT now firmly holds a spot among the top five best-performing ETFs by inflows this year. This is out of more than 4,200 listed funds across all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and commodities. This high ranking underscores the significant investor interest specifically directed towards Bitcoin through this regulated investment vehicle. It suggests that capital is flowing into the crypto asset class at a rate comparable to, or even exceeding, many traditional investment areas. Understanding the Significance of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The consistent and large-scale inflows into funds like BlackRock’s IBIT are widely interpreted as a strong signal of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption . Large financial institutions, wealth managers, and even corporations are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin via accessible, regulated products like spot ETFs. Why is this significant? Validation: It provides a level of legitimacy and validation for Bitcoin as a serious, investable asset class. Accessibility: ETFs simplify the process of investing in Bitcoin for institutions and retail investors alike, removing technical hurdles like managing private keys. Scale: Institutional capital has the potential to move markets on a much larger scale than individual retail investors. Market Maturity: The presence of major players like BlackRock indicates a maturing market infrastructure around crypto assets. While retail interest remains a factor, the bulk of the significant, sustained inflows is attributed to larger players gaining exposure to Bitcoin through these channels. Comparing IBIT to Other Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance While IBIT has been a leader, it’s part of a group of newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Other funds, such as those from Fidelity, Ark Invest, and VanEck, have also seen significant inflows since their launch in January 2024. However, IBIT has consistently been one of the top performers in terms of attracting new capital, often vying for the top spot on any given trading day, alongside Fidelity’s FBTC. The collective success of these funds, particularly IBIT’s dominant performance, highlights the pent-up demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure in the U.S. market. Recent Inflow Snapshot (Example Data): ETF Ticker Issuer Approx. Inflows (Past 2 Weeks) IBIT BlackRock $3.86 billion FBTC Fidelity Significant (Specific data varies daily) ARKB Ark Invest/21Shares Notable (Specific data varies daily) Note: Inflow data is dynamic and subject to change. The figures mentioned for IBIT are based on recent reports. What’s Next for IBIT and Bitcoin? The sustained inflows into the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF suggest continued strong interest from investors seeking exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. This trend could potentially provide upward price pressure on Bitcoin as ETF issuers purchase BTC to back the new shares being created due to inflows. However, it’s important to remember that markets are complex and influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. While institutional adoption via ETFs is a powerful narrative, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. For investors, IBIT and other spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a convenient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin within traditional brokerage accounts. The consistent inflows indicate that a growing number of market participants are choosing this route. Summary: IBIT’s Inflow Streak is a Major Headline BlackRock’s IBIT has demonstrated exceptional performance in attracting capital, with inflows on 30 of the last 31 trading days and accumulating billions in recent weeks. This places it among the elite ETFs by inflows this year, signaling robust and ongoing institutional and potentially retail interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated products. The success of IBIT underscores the growing maturity of the Bitcoin market and the increasing comfort level of traditional finance with digital assets.

2025-05-29T14:28:59.000Z,"Square Flies the Flag for the Lightning Network With 9.7% Yield on Bitcoin Holdings","Square, the payment platform owned by Jack Dorsey's company Block (XYZ) is earning a yield of 9.7% on its bitcoin holdings through running a node on the Lightning network. Block's Bitcoin product lead Miles Suter said that the firm is earning \""real bitcoin returns from our corporate holdings...by efficiently routing real payments across the Lightning network,\"" in an appearance at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The yield is earned through Square's Lightning service provider c=, which was created two years ago to improve liquidity and efficiency on Lightning. Lightning Labs' Ryan Gentry referred to Suter's announcement as \""the biggest news\"" at Bitcoin 2025 in a post on X , estimating that Square's 9.7% yield equates to around $1 million a year. For many years, bitcoin layer-2 network Lightning was hailed as the savior to BTC's problems of scale and speed by creating micropayment channels that can process transactions away from the main blockchain. Over time though some of these hopes have faded owing to Lightning's faults, such as the requirement for inbound liquidity , whereby users must in effect commit BTC in order to receive BTC. This may deter adoption by smaller-scale nodes, which is a hindrance to decentralization. However, Square sees the layer-2 as fundamental to its plans to accelerate BTC payments adoption, with one in four of its outbound bitcoin payments now processed on Lightning, Suter said onstage in Las Vegas. The company is piloting Lightning-based payments at Bitcoin 2025 with plans for a rollout to all eligible Square sellers in 2026. \""When you enable real payments by making the. faster and more convenient, the network gets stronger, smarter and more useful,\"" Suter said. \""So if you're wondering if wondering if bitcoin is still just an asset, the answer is no.

2025-05-29T14:21:26.000Z,"Zebec Network price explodes after Science Card acquisition news","Zebec Network, a top crypto project in the payment industry, surged to a record high after acquiring Science Card. Zebec Network ( ZBCN ) price jumped to an all-time high of $0.00617, giving it a market capitalization of over $500 million. It has risen by more than 770% from its lowest level this month, making it one of the best-performing coins. ZBCN spiked after the company acquired Science Card, a U.K. fintech firm with over 50,000 users. Science Card allows users to send, receive, pay, and save money through its easy-to-use application. Users can then spend using physical and digital cards in over 210 countries, while also contributing to research in areas of interest. In a statement, Zebec said : “With this acquisition, we’re enabling students to spend crypto on campus while funding university research with every swipe, with expansion into education payments.” Zebec Network aims to be a top crypto project in the payment space. It offers debit cards that enable thousands of users to spend their cryptocurrencies globally. It has also become a major player in the payroll industry, serving over 250 enterprise clients and processing over $1 billion in payroll volume.

ZBCN’s surge helped push futures open interest to a record high of over $32 million, up from this month’s low of $2.5 million. Rising open interest is a sign of high demand and liquidity for the coin in the futures market. However, traders in the futures market still expect the coin to fall as the funding rate has remained negative since May 21. Zebec Network price technical analysis ZBCN price chart | Source: crypto.news ZBCN continued its strong rally on Thursday following the Science Card acquisition announcement. It has deviated from its moving average and is up 170% from the 50-day EMA. The token has also become highly overbought, with the Relative Strength Index and Stochastic indicators at extreme levels. As a result, the coin is likely to retreat due to profit-taking and mean reversion. It is common for a sharply rising asset to decline as early holders sell for profit. Mean reversion occurs when an asset returns to its historical moving averages. The Zebec Network token will likely drop and retest support at $0.002143, the highest swing in February.

The current options expiry is still smaller than the expected quarterly event, but open interest is the highest since the start of 2025. The Bitcoin and Ethereum markets are bracing for the monthly options expiry event, which may increase price volatility. Both assets are once again in search of a clear direction. Deribit warns about uncertainty as a total of $11.7B in options expire on Friday. The last Friday of the month arrives with the biggest accrued open interest, before the options close or roll over to the next month. Open interest on Deribit expands as the options market prepares for the upcoming quarterly close in June. 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $11.7B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $10.03B notional | Put/Call: 0.87 | Max Pain: $100K $ETH : $1.67B notional | Put/Call: 0.83 | Max Pain: $2,300 Calls dominate OI at higher strikes, reflecting… pic.twitter.com/VlISVbmL8t — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) May 29, 2025 This time, BTC has the bigger weight with $10.3B in notional value. The put/call ratio for both BTC and ETH signals still notable expectation for growth, but a more cautious positioning. Call options dominate put options for all prices above $100,000. The biggest accumulation of notional value is for the $120,000 call options. The monthly options expiry is often an event that leads to price uncertainty and volatility. Currently, the maximum pain prices are below the BTC and ETH market prices, but the selling pressure will probably not push the assets that low. BTC’s maximum pain price is $100,000, while ETH’s is $2,300, potentially leading to more volatility. Ahead of the options expiration event, BTC traded at $108,513, while ETH recovered close to $2,700. BTC and ETH options reach peak levels for 2025 The Q2 rally for BTC arrived with higher open interest. A year ago, May’s options expiry for BTC had just $4.7B in notional value. The notional value of options increased on Deribit, breaking above $42B as the May expiry looms. | Source: Into The Block The current accrued open interest for BTC and ETH is at the highest level, with almost constant growth since January. After the March options expiry, Deribit carried around $19B in notional value. The market recovery in May brought that value to over $42B. Options markets reacted to the renewed bullish direction for BTC, leading traders to add to their positions. ETH shows signs of outperforming BTC The monthly options expiration event for ETH reflects the recent slow market, as the asset hovered around $2,500. The notional value of just $1.7B for monthly options is relatively low for ETH. Despite this, ETH trading is gaining traction and the asset is starting to outperform BTC in the short term. ETH regained its positions to 0.025 BTC, while being the only major token in the green as of May 29. ETH open interest also expanded rapidly, adding $3B in the past three days. BTC open interest remained near its levels for the past few days, above $37B on major crypto exchanges. ETH is closely watched for signs of sparking an altcoin rally and returning above the $3,000 level. The options expiry event happens as traders are showing signs of greed. The Bitcoin fear and greed index grew to 74 points, up 3 points in a day. The recent setup is seen as a signal for both BTC and ETH to break out following the options expiry.

2025-05-29T14:16:21.000Z,"Want Americans to Trust AI? Decentralize It","A decade ago, Bitcoin felt like the internet in the early ‘90s—niche, experimental, and easy to dismiss. Today? It’s front and center on Capitol Hill. What began as a decentralized outlier many labeled as fringe is slowly becoming a pillar of America’s economy that many consider the future. People can now invest in Bitcoin through their 401(k)s, IRAs, and brokerage accounts. This year, the U.S. created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Roundtables and summits are being hosted at the White House, and pro-Bitcoin positions are showing up in campaign platforms. That shift wasn’t accidental. Bitcoin gained momentum because its core values—open access, transparency, and distributed control—offered an alternative when public trust in traditional finance was eroding. A similar pattern is unfolding today with artificial intelligence. AI Has a Trust Problem AI is booming, but so are questions about who controls it. If you're wondering where your data is going when you use a chatbot, who benefits from it, and why you have to surrender your privacy in the first place, you're not alone. According to a new Harris poll commissioned by DCG , 74% of U.S. respondents believe AI would benefit more people if it weren’t controlled by just a few big companies and 65% don’t trust elected officials to steer AI’s development. The public loves the potential of AI; they just don’t trust the players in charge. That trust gap isn’t new, and Bitcoin confronted it head-on with decentralization: when trust in institutions erodes, the answer isn’t more gatekeepers—it’s building systems that don’t require them. Decentralized technologies rebuild trust by removing human intermediaries, who are often prone to bias, error, or self-interest, and eliminating single points of control. By replacing these flawed gatekeepers with transparent, distributed systems, decentralization offers a more reliable and accountable foundation for trust and confidence, rooted in transparency, resilience, and user-aligned governance. This shift—from human-controlled to technologically decentralized systems—is what makes trust possible again. Decentralized AI: The Internet of Intelligence Unlike Big Tech models controlled by centralized entities, decentralized AI (deAI) is built, trained, and operated across a distributed network, preventing any single party from controlling the system. Decentralized AI (deAI) flips the script on traditional AI by putting power in the hands of users, not corporations. Networks like Bittensor (see Note below) are leading the way by enabling open, permissionless access to AI infrastructure where anyone can contribute models, computing power, or data. This approach levels the playing field for students, startups, and independent developers who would otherwise be shut out of today’s centralized AI giants. Instead of gatekeepers, Bittensor coordinates contributions transparently across a global network, using blockchain to embed trust and reward real value. The result is AI that’s more open, resilient, and fair, where incentives are based on merit, not monopolies. Voters Are Ahead of Lawmakers on Decentralized AI While Americans are still in the earlier stage of learning about AI technologies, they can already intuitively anticipate the advantages of decentralized AI. The Harris poll of 2,000 US adults found: 75% say decentralized AI better supports innovation 71% say it’s more secure for personal data Three out of four respondents say decentralized AI drives more innovation than closed AI, and 71% believe it offers stronger protection for personal data. What’s missing for consumers using AI is transparency and control, and they want to know they’re not just training someone else’s profit engine. Policy Can’t Ignore Infrastructure and Ownership Even with strong public support, the promise of decentralized AI depends on whether policymakers understand a simple fact: the structure of a system determines its behavior and outcomes.However, the regulatory conversation around AI is still catching up, and in many cases, seems to be missing a crucial point. We’re seeing big debates around safety and existential risk, but almost no airtime for how the foundational structure of these systems impacts trust. A centralized model run by a few powerful players is inherently vulnerable, opaque, and exclusionary and will ultimately erode trust. To encourage trust, technological adoption and innovation, policymakers should: Incentivize innovation in open ecosystems Ensure people can benefit from their data Avoid enshrining Big Tech dominance through regulation The same gatekeepers who shaped today’s AI shouldn’t control its future, especially with the public calling for real alternatives. The current Administration has taken a refreshingly pragmatic approach to AI, prioritizing innovation and American competitiveness over heavy-handed regulation and we hope Congress will do the same. Emphasizing private sector innovation and decentralized development lays the groundwork for a more open and resilient AI future. It’s Not Fringe. It’s the Future Decentralized AI is a forward-looking solution to one of the most urgent challenges of our time: how to ensure AI serves the public, not just the powerful. Just as Bitcoin moved from the margins to the mainstream, decentralized AI is quickly becoming the foundation for a more open, secure, and competitive AI ecosystem. The public gets it. Now policymakers must catch up. The choice is clear: protect open networks, reward real builders, and defend the freedom to innovate—or hand the future of intelligence to a few corporate gatekeepers. Decentralized AI isn’t fringe. It’s the foundation for a freer, fairer digital future. Let’s not miss the moment.

Regulatory clarity is also playing a role. Sentora noted that new U.S. federal stablecoin legislation — referred to as GENIUS Act — and a successor to the FIT 21 Act are expected to be introduced in 2025. Follow-up guidance from the SEC and CFTC could enable regulated bank custody of digital assets and introduce formal DeFi oversight frameworks by 2027.

2025-05-29T14:10:02.000Z,"Bitcoin Plunge: BTC Falls Below $107,000 Amid Market Volatility","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Plunge: BTC Falls Below $107,000 Amid Market Volatility The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a moment of heightened attention as the Bitcoin price takes a notable dip. According to the latest market monitoring data, the flagship cryptocurrency has fallen below the significant $107,000 mark, capturing the focus of traders and investors worldwide. This movement underscores the inherent volatility that remains a defining characteristic of the digital asset space. What’s Happening with the Bitcoin Price Right Now? As reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin has indeed slipped past the $107,000 threshold. Specifically, on the widely-used Binance USDT market, Bitcoin price is currently trading around $106,976.01. While seemingly a small numerical drop, breaching a psychological or technical level like $107,000 can often trigger further market reactions. This price point is being watched closely as participants assess whether this is a minor correction or the start of a larger trend. Here’s a quick look at the recent price action: Metric Value (Approx.) Recent High ~$107,500 Current Price (Binance) $106,976.01 Key Level Breached $107,000 This snapshot highlights the immediate impact of the recent selling pressure on the Bitcoin price . Why Did the BTC Price Drop Occur? A Look at Market Factors Understanding the reasons behind a BTC price drop is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Price movements are rarely due to a single factor but rather a confluence of global economic signals, market sentiment, technical indicators, and specific crypto-related news. Potential factors contributing to the recent BTC price drop could include: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic data, inflation reports, interest rate decisions, or geopolitical events can influence investor risk appetite, leading some to move away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Profit Taking: After periods of upward movement, some investors may decide to sell a portion of their holdings to realize gains, putting downward pressure on the price. Technical Indicators: Traders using technical analysis might have identified resistance levels or bearish patterns that triggered sell orders once the price reached certain points. Regulatory News: Any news or rumors concerning potential cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can cause uncertainty and impact prices. Liquidity Shifts: Large movements of Bitcoin by whales (large holders) or institutional players can significantly affect market depth and price. Pinpointing the exact cause in real-time is challenging, but these are common drivers behind a BTC price drop . Staying Informed with the Latest Crypto Market News In a fast-paced environment like cryptocurrency, keeping up with the latest crypto market news is paramount. Price movements like Bitcoin falling below $107,000 are often reactions to underlying events or shifts in sentiment that are first reported through news channels and market analysis platforms. What should you look for in the crypto market news ? Volume Analysis: Is the price drop accompanied by high trading volume? High volume on a downward move can indicate strong selling pressure. Altcoin Performance: How are other major cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum, Solana, etc.) performing? If they are also dropping, it might indicate a broader market sentiment shift. If they are holding steady or rising, the move might be specific to Bitcoin. Social Sentiment: What is the general mood on social media and crypto forums? Is there widespread fear (FUD – Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or is the sentiment still relatively positive? On-Chain Data: Metrics like exchange inflows/outflows, active addresses, and miner behavior can provide deeper insights into market activity not immediately visible in price charts. Staying informed through reliable crypto market news sources helps provide context to price action. What Does It Mean When Bitcoin Falls Below a Key Level? When Bitcoin falls below a previously established support level, like $107,000 in this instance, it can have several implications for traders and investors. Support levels are price points where buying interest is historically strong enough to prevent the price from falling further. Breaking below such a level can signal that selling pressure is currently overcoming buying demand. Implications when Bitcoin falls past support: Potential for Further Downside: Breaking support can lead to a test of the next lower support level as stop-loss orders are triggered and sentiment turns more bearish. Shift in Market Sentiment: It can increase fear and uncertainty among holders, potentially leading to more selling. Opportunity for Buyers?: Conversely, long-term investors might see this as a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, believing the price will recover. Technical Analysis Changes: Chart patterns and technical indicators may shift, requiring traders to reassess their strategies. The significance of when Bitcoin falls depends heavily on the context – the speed of the drop, the volume, and the broader market environment. Actionable Insights from Current Crypto Market Analysis For those engaged in the market, conducting thorough crypto market analysis is essential, especially during periods of volatility. A price drop isn’t just news; it’s data that informs potential actions. Actionable insights derived from current crypto market analysis could include: Review Your Strategy: Does your investment plan account for volatility? Are you a long-term holder or a short-term trader? This dip might test your conviction. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Market dips are a stark reminder of the risks involved. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t panic sell based on fear. Look at the fundamentals, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin, and reliable analysis before making decisions. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Some investors use dips as opportunities to buy a fixed dollar amount of Bitcoin regularly, regardless of price, potentially lowering their average cost over time. Set Alerts: Use price alerts to notify you of significant movements so you can react according to your plan. Effective crypto market analysis involves more than just looking at price charts; it requires understanding context, sentiment, and having a predefined strategy. Challenges and Opportunities in a Volatile Market The primary challenge highlighted by events like Bitcoin falling below $107,000 is market volatility. This can lead to significant unrealized or realized losses for investors who are not prepared. Emotional decision-making, often driven by fear or greed during rapid price swings, is another major hurdle. However, volatility also presents opportunities. For those with a long-term perspective, dips can be buying opportunities at potentially lower prices. Traders may find opportunities in both upward and downward movements through various trading strategies. Conclusion: Navigating the Dip Bitcoin’s recent dip below $107,000 serves as a fresh reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While short-term price movements can be unsettling, particularly a BTC price drop below a key level, it’s crucial to view them within the broader context of Bitcoin’s history and the evolving digital asset landscape. Staying informed with reliable crypto market news , conducting your own crypto market analysis , and sticking to a well-thought-out investment strategy are the most effective ways to navigate periods when Bitcoin falls . The market continues to mature, but volatility remains a constant companion on this exciting journey.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding.

He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

2025-05-29T11:05:29.000Z,"Reserve Bank of India to roll out new use cases for digital rupee","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to broaden the reach of its digital rupee pilots by introducing new use cases and features for both its retail and wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), according to the central bank’s Annual Report for 2024–25.The central bank said it aims to explore programmability and offline capabilities for the digital rupee, features that may increase its applicability in areas with limited internet access and tailor payments for specific use cases such as government subsidies or corporate spending controls.Currently, both versions of the CBDC are undergoing pilot testing. The retail CBDC pilot is being conducted with select customers and merchants through participating banks, while the wholesale pilot is targeting use in the interbank market.Per the report, the retail pilot has reached 600,000 users across 17 banks. To further scale adoption, the RBI has allowed “certain non-banks [...] to offer CBDC wallets.”The wholesale pilot has also seen increased institutional interest. The scope of the wholesale was further expanded and diversified with the addition of four standalone primary dealers (SPDs), the report confirmed.Related: Indian high court orders steps to block Proton MailIndia dominates real-time paymentsDuring the financial year 2024–25, digital payments in India experienced significant growth, both in terms of volume and value. According to the report, total digital payments recorded a growth of 34.8% in volume and 17.9% in value.Furthermore, India dominated global real-time payments during the year. The RBI noted that the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) “placed India in a leadership position with a share of 48.5 percent in global real-time payments by volume.”The central bank said several innovative features were introduced to extend the benefits of digital payments to wider segments of society.For instance, the report mentions that the “Delegated Payments” feature was rolled out, allowing “individuals (primary user) to allow another individual (secondary user) to make UPI transactions up to a limit from the primary user’s bank account.”An excerpt of the report.

New features include “Magic Nodes,” which uncover hidden wallet connections among tokenholders, and “Time Travel,” a tool that reconstructs the historical distribution of tokens, potentially detecting early insider activity or coordinated accumulation efforts.“Historical data in crypto is notoriously hard to access because it gets buried under endless new transactions,” Bubblemaps CEO Nicolas Vaiman told Cointelegraph.“Time Travel changes that. It’s like watching a Big Bang, from the initial burst of a single bubble to a full-grown distribution,” he said.Source: BubblemapsThe tool allows users to rewind the token’s entire life cycle and evolving distribution structure, which will help them spot “early signs of manipulation or coordinated dumps,” Vaiman added.Related: Sui validators vote on $162M Cetus recovery plan to restore user fundsSpotting tokens with a large portion of the supply concentrated across a few wallets can help investors detect scams such as rug pulls, where insiders remove liquidity or stage a mass sell-off, resulting in a steep price collapse that leaves investors with worthless tokens.A large-scale rug pull hit the crypto industry on March 16 after the sudden collapse of the Wolf of Wall Street-inspired WOLF token, created by Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) and the Libra token.Source: BubblemapsThe memecoin saw a 99% crash, wiping out most of its peak $42 million market capitalization within a few hours.

CEO Leah Wald said the move supports the company’s long-term growth plans.“The filing of a base shelf prospectus supports our growth strategy by providing us with the flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem,” she said.Source: Sol StrategiesIn a May 28 announcement, Solana treasury firm DeFi Dev announced its adoption of Solana liquid staking tokens. The firm will now divert part of its Solana holdings to the liquid staking token dfdvSOL.The announcement followed DeFi Dev’s addition of 88,164 SOL to its treasury in late April, valued at $11.5 million at the time, when it held $34.4 million worth of Solana (SOL).Related: Solana chart hints at 180% rally to $300 if key technical trend holdsWhat is liquid staking?Liquid staking allows tokenholders to earn staking rewards without locking up their assets. Instead, they receive a liquid token that can be traded or used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  DeFi Dev expects the adoption of this technology to “enhance the company’s validator operations and treasury management, consistent with its mission to maximize SOL Per Share” growth. Chief investment officer and chief operating officer Parker White said:The adoption of dfdvSOL not only creates additional ways to drive stake to our validators and increase SOL holdings, but also advances our role as a long-term participant in the Solana ecosystem.”Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard CharteredSol Strategies prepares to safeguard capitalSol Strategies also announced on May 28 that it had completed several key audits and certifications. The company passed SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1 audits and received ISO 27001 certification for its Solana staking platform.  SOC 2 Type 1 is a report assessing a company’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy at a specific point in time. Such an audit verifies that the firm’s controls meet trust service criteria at the time of the check.SOC 1 Type 1 is a similar report focused on internal controls over financial reporting at a specific point in time. This audit evaluates whether the controls are appropriately designed, but does not assess their effectiveness over time.Lastly, ISO 27001 is an international standard specifying requirements for an information security management system. These standards help manage risks pertaining to data confidentiality, integrity and availability through a continuous improvement framework.To obtain this ISO certificate, a company must demonstrate both the documentation and implementation of controls. Sol Strategies’ Wald explained that all these measures are meant to ensure institutional trust:“By achieving SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1, alongside our ISO 27001 certification, we’ve demonstrated that institutional clients can trust SOL Strategies with their Solana staking needs.”The compliance efforts come as the firm continues to position itself as a major Solana validator.

At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion.Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did,” Arkham wrote, adding that the amount represents 87.5% of the total Bitcoin holdings of Strategy. Cointelegraph reached out to Arkham and Strategy for comment but had not received a response by publication time.  Source: Arkham IntelligenceStrategy chairman says publishing addresses “not a good idea” Arkam’s claims follow comments from Saylor about the risks of publishing wallet addresses. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Saylor said that publishing wallet addresses is dangerous for companies holding Bitcoin. “No institutional grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth,” Saylor said. The executive said making wallets public allows every future transaction to be scrutinized, exposing a company to risks that may not be immediately apparent. To highlight his point, Saylor suggested using artificial intelligence to explore the issue. Saylor said if a user puts AI in deep think mode and asks about security problems associated with publishing wallet addresses, the executive said the response could get “50 pages” of security problems.Related: Metaplanet issues $21M in bonds to buy Bitcoin, a day after $50M raiseArkham previously accused of mislabelling walletsWhile blockchain data is publicly available, the accuracy of claims related to wallet ownership has been questioned before. At the height of the Mantra token collapse, Mantra CEO John Mullin denied accusations of insiders dumping their token.

It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

K33 could purchase up to 57 Bitcoin (BTC) at BTC’s current price of just over $108,000. Source: K33K33 CEO Bull Jenssen posted to X on May 28 that he thinks Bitcoin will be the “best-performing asset in the coming decade,” and his company will “accumulate as many as possible while unlocking powerful operational synergies with our brokerage operation.”“Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build you own? Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028. The remaining 15 million Swedish krona ($1.5 million) will come through a new share issuance and warrants, according to K33. If investors convert their warrants before March 2026, they are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling.

Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share.

Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends.

The net result favors the call instruments by $200 million.Between $2,500 and $2,600: $500 million calls vs. $130 million puts, favoring calls by $370 million.Between $2,600 and $2,700: $590 million calls vs. $35 million puts, favoring calls by $555 million.Between $2,700 and $2,900: $780 million calls vs. $10 million puts, favoring calls by $770 million.Bulls are strongly incentivized to push ETH past $2,700, yet the broader context may override those efforts. Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Blockchain security firm Dedaub released a post-mortem report dissecting the incident details. According to the report, the hack was caused by an exploit of the liquidity parameters used by the Cetus automated market maker (AMM).The hackers manipulated the field by altering values that went undetected in a most significant bits (MSB) check. Changes to a binary code’s most significant bits dramatically alter the values produced by that binary code.This allowed the hackers to add massive amounts of liquidity to the system with only a keystroke and drain other liquidity pools of hundreds of millions of dollars.Magazine: Weird ‘null address’ iVest hack, millions of PCs still vulnerable to ‘Sinkclose’ malware: Crypto-Sec",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cork-protocol-hacked-contracts-paused?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved.

The analyst believes real-world assets (RWAs) linking with NFTs could reignite the lending sector of digital collectibles. RWA NFTs also showed potential earlier this year. In April, digital collections in the RWA marketplace Courtyard drove Polygon-based NFT sales to $22.3 million. This allowed the blockchain to surpass Ethereum in weekly sales.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-sales-rebound-may-2025-cryptoslam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
