2025-05-29T05:58:08.000Z,"Ethereum reclaims $2.7K amid rising institutional interest — is 3K ETH price on the horizon?","Ethereum has crossed $2,700 for the first time since February, rising nearly 5% over the past 24 hours to trade at $2,736 at press time. The move extends its impressive recovery, with Ethereum ( ETH ) now up 53% over the past month after a rough Q1 that saw prices drop more than 45%. A major driver behind the rally appears to be growing institutional interest. U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds have attracted $402 million in inflows over the past month, according to SoSoValue data . BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust alone brought in $53 million in the past 24 hours, pushing its cumulative inflows to $4.3 billion. Some industry leaders are now pushing for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve staking for Ethereum ETFs. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce recently clarified that Ethereum’s proof-of-stake functions, such as node operations and validation, are not considered securities. If ETF staking requests from companies like 21Shares are approved, more inflows could follow. The trend is further highlighted by the large-scale ETH purchases made by institutions. Over 350,000 Ethereum, worth about $837 million, were purchased by Abraxas Capital between May 7 and May 21. In addition, the company pulled 185,000 ETH from exchanges during a 44% price increase at the beginning of May, demonstrating long-term conviction.

In another sign of growing adoption, online gambling firm SharpLink Gaming raised $425 million on May 27, led by ConsenSys, to establish an Ethereum treasury. The news sent its stock soaring 400%, and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin joined the company’s board. On the daily chart, Ethereum is currently displaying bullish momentum as it tests the upper Bollinger Band. The price is still above the $2,573 20-day simple moving average, which has served as a crucial support level for the rally. ETH is forming a rising wedge pattern, which could indicate continuation if it breaks above the $2,800 resistance. ETH price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The 50-day and 100-day EMAs, as well as the majority of other significant moving averages, are flashing buy signals. The relative strength index, which is at 71.5, indicates that ETH may be approaching overbought territory. A brief pause or pullback may result from this, particularly as the market gets closer to the psychological $2,800 and $3,000 levels. Ethereum may retest support at $2,650 or the 20-day SMA at $2,573 if it is unable to maintain above $2,700. However, a breakout above $2,800 could result in $2,900 and higher if momentum continues.

2025-05-29T05:57:46.000Z,"Pundit Who Predicted $8 XRP Price Says Everything Is Ready to Go","Xena XRP (@XenaXrp), a well-known voice in the XRP community, has clarified recent remarks surrounding a projected $8 price target for XRP in 2025, following an article published by The Crypto Basic that summarized her views. Taking to social media, Xena sought to provide context to her earlier statements, emphasizing both the significance of such a price movement and the broader outlook for the digital asset. In her post, Xena acknowledged that moving from sub-dollar levels to $8 would represent a notable milestone for XRP. She emphasized that many investors, particularly those who have held the asset for years, would experience meaningful gains if this target were reached. However, she also stressed that not everyone would consider $8 to be a final destination, especially those who are waiting for much higher valuations. “For many of you, that would be life-changing,” she wrote. “While others would have to wait for higher levels, but with the confidence, it’s finally getting somewhere.” Her message pointed to the varied expectations within the XRP community, highlighting that gains are relative depending on entry point and investment horizon. Y'all have a way to write articles and sometimes I don't quite get it lol This one is about me and what I said about $8 XRP for this year. I want to be very clear : from cents to $8 would be a great achievement after years spent below a dollar. Many of you would have life… pic.twitter.com/HUj3UW16bw — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) May 27, 2025 A Message for Long-Time Holders and Recent Investors She added that even if XRP were to stabilize at $2, it would still be viewed as a positive outcome for early adopters. “Nobody can tell you XRP was a bad investment because you made money already,” she noted, particularly addressing those who entered the market when the token was priced significantly lower. Xena also spoke candidly about long-time holders who purchased during XRP’s previous all-time high around $3.30 in 2017–2018. She stated that most of those individuals have likely exited the market already, accepting their losses. “But that’s part of the game,” she remarked, suggesting that such volatility is a known and accepted part of crypto investing. Market Movements and Unnatural Price Behavior Addressing recent market turbulence, she reaffirmed her earlier prediction that XRP would not drop below $2. While acknowledging that a temporary dip occurred following tariff-related announcements, she noted that XRP recovered quickly and remained in the $2 range. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 She also alluded to historical concerns over XRP’s price behavior during its past rallies. Referencing an earlier claim by another community member, she said XRP’s previous surge to $3.30 did not appear to be a “natural” move. Without elaborating on the cause, she simply stated, “He was right. I’m just leaving this here,” followed by a general observation about XRP’s tendency to correct after brief rallies. Skepticism Toward Chart-Based Forecasts Xena pushed back against any suggestion that current price levels are being suppressed arbitrarily. “If it wasn’t on purpose, they would have brought this down back at 50 cents already. Believe it,” she wrote, arguing that XRP’s ability to stay above key psychological levels is evidence of underlying strength. Regarding the $8 prediction itself, she clarified that the figure originated from chart-based speculation, not insider information. She attributed the number to an analyst known as Water Above, whose forecast was amplified by another influencer, Bearable Bull. “It’s just a random number based on charts,” she said, urging caution in placing too much faith in projections that rely heavily on Bitcoin’s behavior. Ripple’s Long-Term Commitment and Global Expansion Xena concluded her post by reaffirming her long-term belief in XRP’s potential, pointing out the persistent efforts of Ripple, the company associated with XRP’s development and adoption. While Ripple has spent the past several years battling the SEC in court, she stressed that the company has continued to expand globally. “There is so much they are not talking about,” she added. Echoing the popular phrase used by another content creator in the community, she closed with: “As DAI likes to say: The world’s a stage. Everything is ready to go.

2025-05-29T05:54:30.000Z,"Bitcoin in 'pivot zone' as potential consolidation looms: Analyst","Bitcoin markets could be in for another prolonged period of consolidation if there isn’t more buying pressure this week, says analyst Willy Woo. The strength of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) run from $75,000 on April 7 to its all-time high just below $112,000 on May 22 “is starting to break down,” Woo wrote to X on May 28. “This week is absolutely critical,” he said. “If we do not get follow-through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” Woo said that in the short term, “late comer speculators” are taking long positions while potential profit taking “is ready to dump” as seen in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is a measure of the price paid divided by the price sold. “This week’s spot buying will strongly influence the next 1-2 months of price action. We are in a pivot zone.” Bitcoin short-term models.

2025-05-29T05:50:34.000Z,"XRP Treasury Strategy: VivoPower Secures $121M for Pioneering Move","BitcoinWorld XRP Treasury Strategy: VivoPower Secures $121M for Pioneering Move Imagine a public company listed on a major stock exchange deciding to put a significant portion of its balance sheet into a volatile digital asset. That’s precisely what VivoPower International (Nasdaq: VVPR) is aiming to do, following a massive $121 million fundraising round. The goal? To launch an ambitious XRP corporate treasury strategy, a move that could position them as pioneers in the world of institutional crypto adoption. What is This VivoPower XRP Treasury Strategy All About? At its core, VivoPower plans to hold XRP , the digital asset associated with Ripple, as a primary component of its corporate treasury reserves. This isn’t just about holding a small amount; the substantial $121 million raised, led by Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud, is specifically earmarked to fund this strategy. The company intends to potentially become the first Nasdaq-listed entity to center its treasury operations around a digital asset like XRP . Traditionally, corporate treasuries hold assets like cash, short-term government bonds, or other low-risk, liquid investments. The idea is to preserve capital and ensure liquidity for operational needs. Shifting towards digital assets like XRP represents a significant departure and signals a strong belief in the future value and utility of cryptocurrencies. Why Choose XRP for Corporate Treasury? The decision to focus on XRP specifically for a corporate treasury strategy is noteworthy. While Bitcoin has gained some traction as a treasury asset among a few companies, XRP presents a different proposition. Supporters often highlight its speed and low transaction costs, features initially designed for facilitating cross-border payments. Factors that might influence a company like VivoPower to consider XRP could include: Potential for Growth: A belief that XRP ‘s value could appreciate significantly over time, offering potentially higher returns than traditional treasury assets. Utility Focus: Interest in leveraging XRP ‘s underlying technology for potential future business applications, especially if the company has international operations or payment needs. Strategic Positioning: Aiming to be at the forefront of digital asset integration within traditional finance structures. Connection to Ripple XRP: While legally distinct, the association with Ripple and its established network might offer perceived advantages or future opportunities. It’s crucial to remember that selecting any digital asset for a treasury involves careful consideration of its unique characteristics, market dynamics, and regulatory status. The Role of Institutional Crypto Adoption and Adam Traidman This move by VivoPower fits into the broader narrative of institutional crypto adoption . More and more traditional companies and financial institutions are exploring ways to engage with digital assets, whether through investment, integrating blockchain technology, or offering crypto-related services. A significant factor bolstering VivoPower’s strategy is the addition of former Ripple executive Adam Traidman, who will serve as chairman of VivoPower’s advisory board. Traidman’s experience within the Ripple XRP ecosystem brings valuable expertise and credibility to VivoPower’s ambitious plan. His involvement suggests a deeper understanding of the asset and its potential applications beyond simple speculation. The presence of experienced figures from the crypto space on corporate boards or advisory committees is becoming increasingly common as companies navigate this new landscape. It helps bridge the gap between traditional corporate governance and the nuances of digital assets. Potential Benefits and Challenges of a VivoPower XRP Treasury Adopting an XRP corporate treasury strategy comes with both potential upsides and considerable risks. VivoPower will need to navigate these carefully. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: If XRP performs well, the treasury holdings could significantly boost the company’s balance sheet value. Inflation Hedge: Some view digital assets as a potential hedge against inflation, though this is a debated topic. Innovation Leader: Positions VivoPower as an innovative company embracing future financial technologies. Attracting Investors: May appeal to investors interested in exposure to digital assets through a publicly traded stock. Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including XRP , are known for extreme price swings, which could negatively impact the company’s financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for XRP and other digital assets is still evolving globally, posing potential legal and compliance risks. The ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple adds a layer of complexity. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting and Tax Issues: The accounting treatment for crypto holdings is complex and can vary by jurisdiction. Tax implications need careful management. Market Perception: Some traditional investors may view this strategy as overly risky or speculative. Managing these challenges will be critical to the success of VivoPower’s pioneering approach. Is This a Trend for Corporate Treasury Going Forward? The question on many minds is whether VivoPower’s move is an isolated event or the start of a broader trend. While companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve, VivoPower ‘s focus on XRP is unique among publicly traded firms. Several factors could influence whether other companies follow suit: Regulatory Clarity: Greater regulatory certainty around digital assets would likely encourage more corporate adoption. Market Performance: Sustained positive performance of assets like XRP could make them more attractive as treasury holdings. Accounting Standards: Clearer and more consistent accounting standards for digital assets are needed. Peer Influence: If VivoPower demonstrates success (or struggles) with this strategy, it will certainly inform decisions at other companies. For now, VivoPower appears to be venturing into relatively uncharted territory for a Nasdaq-listed company, making its progress a key indicator for potential future trends in corporate treasury crypto strategies. Conclusion: A Bold Step in Institutional Crypto VivoPower’s decision to raise $121 million specifically for an XRP corporate treasury strategy, supported by significant investors and guided by former Ripple XRP expertise, represents a bold and potentially transformative step. It highlights the increasing interest in integrating digital assets into traditional financial structures and pushes the boundaries of what constitutes a corporate treasury asset. While the path forward involves navigating volatility and regulatory complexities, VivoPower’s initiative is a significant development in the evolution of institutional crypto adoption . The industry will be watching closely to see how this pioneering strategy unfolds and what it could mean for the future of corporate finance.

Cycles Are Changing—The Old Rules Don’t Apply BTC is global macro this cycle. Which means don't necessarily bet on nicely manicured 4 year cycles. BTC is transitioning. Internal forces, the halvening, is getting weak, global liquidity powers BTC – hence BTC is becoming the canary in the coal mine for global macro moves. https://t.co/c56yYmn0Na — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 28, 2025 Woo explains that Bitcoin is no longer behaving like it did in past bull runs. Earlier, its four-year halving cycle had a big influence, but now, he says, the bigger force is global liquidity. That means BTC is acting more like a traditional asset, moving with global economic trends rather than its usual crypto patterns. Echoing Woo’s sentiment, crypto analyst Maui Jim believes it’s outdated to expect a predictable sell-off in September or a new bottom a year later. The market is maturing and becoming harder to predict. The fact that Bitcoin hit a new all-time high even before the halving was a major clue that the game has changed. Flat Buying Pressure Raises Eyebrows Despite the sharp price move from $75,000 to $110,000, Woo notes that capital inflows have been flat over the past few days, a surprising trend. This lack of buying pressure could spell trouble if U.S. markets don’t step in with more demand now that the long weekend is over. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan to Launch Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Will BTC Price Regain Bullish Momentum? , Still Room for $114K, But Warning Signs Flashing Woo hasn’t turned bearish just yet.

But if momentum fades, the market could cool off, forming bearish divergences and triggering another round of profit-taking.

Given the warning signs of speculation and market greed, it’s wise to consider taking partial profits, especially if you’re already sitting on significant gains. However, the long-term trend remains strong, so holding some position while setting stop-losses to protect profits can balance risk and reward. How might U.S. market demand influence Bitcoin’s price movement this week? Since capital inflows have been flat, renewed buying from U.S. institutions or retail could reignite momentum, pushing prices toward $114K. Conversely, if U.S. markets remain subdued, it may trigger selling pressure and a correction. Watching market open volumes and demand will be key. What does “flat buying pressure” signify for Bitcoin’s price? Despite the recent price jump, a lack of new capital inflows could lead to trouble if U.S. markets don’t inject more demand.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-bitcoins-rally-sustainable-willy-woo-highlights-risk-of-profit-taking-at-110k/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T05:40:49.000Z,"GameStop Bitcoin: Ryan Cohen Calls BTC a Potent Hedge Against Currency Devaluation","BitcoinWorld GameStop Bitcoin: Ryan Cohen Calls BTC a Potent Hedge Against Currency Devaluation In a move that grabbed headlines across both the finance and crypto worlds, Ryan Cohen, the CEO of GameStop, recently shared a significant perspective on the role of digital assets. According to reports citing Bitcoin Magazine via X, Cohen suggested that Bitcoin has the potential to act as a powerful hedge against global currency devaluation . This statement comes after Bitcoin World previously highlighted GameStop’s own substantial investment, having acquired 4,710 BTC. Why Does Ryan Cohen See Bitcoin as a Hedge? Ryan Cohen, known for his role in turning around Chewy and his involvement in the GameStop saga, is not a traditional finance insider. His perspective often comes from a place of challenging established norms. His view that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against currency devaluation likely stems from concerns about modern monetary policy and its potential impact on the purchasing power of traditional fiat currencies. Several factors could contribute to this viewpoint: Inflationary Pressures: Central banks globally have engaged in significant quantitative easing and stimulus measures over the past decade, particularly following economic crises. This increases the money supply, potentially leading to inflation, which erodes the value of savings and earnings held in traditional currencies. Government Debt: Rising levels of national debt in many countries can raise concerns about future economic stability and the temptation for governments to inflate away debt burdens. Centralization vs. Decentralization: Fiat currencies are controlled by central authorities (governments and central banks). Their supply and policies can be manipulated. Bitcoin, in contrast, is decentralized with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, making its issuance schedule predictable and beyond the control of any single entity. From this perspective, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature offer a potential escape hatch from the risks associated with centralized control and potential inflationary policies that lead to currency devaluation . Understanding the Bitcoin Hedge Concept The idea of using Bitcoin as a hedge is not new, but it gained significant traction during periods of economic uncertainty. A hedge is an investment intended to offset potential losses from another investment. Traditionally, assets like gold, silver, and real estate have been considered hedges against inflation or economic instability. How might Bitcoin function as a hedge, particularly against currency devaluation ? Limited Supply: Unlike fiat currencies, whose supply can be increased by central banks, Bitcoin has a hard cap on the total number of coins that will ever exist. This scarcity is often compared to precious metals and is seen as a fundamental defense against inflation driven by supply expansion. Decentralization: Bitcoin’s network operates independently of any government or financial institution. This makes it resistant to censorship, seizure, and policies that might negatively impact traditional assets or currencies within a specific jurisdiction. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin is a global asset, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This contrasts with national currencies, which are tied to specific countries and their economic fortunes. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the debate surrounding Bitcoin’s effectiveness as a hedge. Its relatively short history compared to gold, and its significant price volatility, mean it doesn’t always behave like a stable store of value in the short term. While it may protect against long-term currency devaluation , holders must be prepared for substantial price swings. GameStop’s Bold GameStop Bitcoin Investment Adding weight to Ryan Cohen ‘s public statements is GameStop’s tangible action: the purchase of 4,710 BTC. This investment signals a belief within the company’s leadership that holding Bitcoin is a strategic move for their corporate treasury. Details about the exact timing and rationale behind GameStop’s purchase of 4,710 BTC are key. While specific internal discussions aren’t public, the general motivations for a company like GameStop to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet likely align with the hedge concept mentioned by Cohen, alongside other potential benefits: Treasury Diversification: Moving a portion of corporate cash reserves out of traditional low-yield, inflation-susceptible assets into a potentially high-growth, uncorrelated asset class. Protection Against Inflation/Devaluation: Directly acting on the belief that Bitcoin can preserve purchasing power better than fiat over time, especially relevant given concerns about ongoing currency devaluation . Potential for Appreciation: While framed as a hedge, the potential for significant capital gains is undoubtedly a factor for companies adopting Bitcoin. Signaling: Adopting Bitcoin can signal forward-thinking, technological savvy, and potentially attract investors interested in digital assets. GameStop’s decision, under the leadership influenced by Ryan Cohen , positions it among a growing list of publicly traded companies embracing corporate Bitcoin adoption . The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption GameStop is not alone in adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Over the past few years, there has been a notable trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption among publicly traded companies. This movement was significantly popularized by firms like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has amassed a very large Bitcoin holding. Other notable examples include: MicroStrategy: A business intelligence firm that has become one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, consistently adding to its reserves. Tesla: The electric vehicle company, led by Elon Musk, made a significant Bitcoin purchase in early 2021, though they have also sold portions of their holdings at times. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s payments company has also invested in Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy. This trend underscores a shifting perception of Bitcoin , moving from a purely speculative retail asset to one considered viable for sophisticated corporate treasury management, often driven by the very concerns about currency devaluation that Ryan Cohen highlighted. Companies engaging in corporate Bitcoin adoption are making a calculated bet that the potential benefits – protection against inflation, diversification, and long-term appreciation – outweigh the risks associated with volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Navigating the Challenges of Using Bitcoin as a Hedge While the arguments for Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation are compelling to many, it’s essential to consider the challenges and risks involved. No investment is without its downsides, and Bitcoin is no exception. Key challenges include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile. While this offers potential for high returns, it also means significant drawdowns are possible, which might not align with the stability typically sought in a hedge asset. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact Bitcoin’s usability, legality, and market value. Security Risks: Holding Bitcoin requires secure storage solutions (wallets). Loss of private keys or security breaches can result in irreversible loss of funds. Market Manipulation Concerns: The crypto market is still relatively young and can be susceptible to large players influencing prices. These challenges mean that while Ryan Cohen and GameStop see Bitcoin as a potential hedge, it’s a strategy that requires a high tolerance for risk and a long-term perspective, acknowledging that short-term performance may not always align with traditional hedge characteristics. What Does This Mean for Investors and Businesses? Actionable Insights The statements from figures like Ryan Cohen and the actions of companies engaging in corporate Bitcoin adoption raise important questions for both individual investors and businesses considering their own financial strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Educate Yourself: Understand what Bitcoin is, how it works, and the economic principles behind the arguments for and against its use as a hedge. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and ensure it fits within your overall financial strategy. Consider Diversification: A hedge is typically part of a diversified portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Explore different asset classes. Evaluate Long-Term Trends: If you believe that concerns about currency devaluation are valid long-term risks, explore assets like Bitcoin or others traditionally considered hedges (like gold) that might offer protection. For Businesses: Carefully evaluate treasury management goals, risk appetite, and regulatory considerations before considering holding volatile assets like Bitcoin. Consult with financial and legal experts. The fact that a company like GameStop, influenced by Ryan Cohen , is publicly acknowledging Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge and backing it with investment is a significant data point in the ongoing evolution of how digital assets are perceived and utilized in the global economy. Summary: Bitcoin’s Growing Role in a Devaluing World Ryan Cohen’s assertion that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against global currency devaluation , coupled with GameStop’s concrete action of purchasing 4,710 BTC, highlights a growing recognition of digital assets in mainstream finance. This perspective is rooted in concerns about inflationary pressures and the stability of traditional fiat currencies in an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and government debt. While the concept of Bitcoin as a hedge is debated due to its volatility, its fixed supply and decentralized nature offer characteristics appealing to those seeking alternatives to centralized currency systems. GameStop’s move is part of a broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption , where companies are exploring digital assets for treasury diversification and potential long-term value preservation. For both individuals and businesses, this development underscores the importance of understanding the changing financial landscape, evaluating the risks and potential benefits of assets like Bitcoin, and considering how best to navigate a world where concerns about currency devaluation are becoming increasingly prominent.

2025-05-29T05:39:11.000Z,"HTX DeepThink: Rotation Signals Emerging–Crypto Credit and InfoFi Poised as New Market Focal Points","BitcoinWorld HTX DeepThink: Rotation Signals Emerging–Crypto Credit and InfoFi Poised as New Market Focal Points SINGAPORE, May 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — As May draws to a close, the crypto market continues its upward momentum, fueled by a renewed wave of macro liquidity. Bitcoin demonstrates resilience, with improved on-chain capital structure and a steady rise in risk appetite. High-beta assets and quality altcoins are drawing increasing attention, signaling an emerging rotation trend. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research explores the evolving potential and structural value of crypto credit and InfoFi as key sectors in this next phase. Structural Shift Under Macro Support: Bitcoin Holds Firm as Altseason Builds Momentum As of May 21, 2025, the Federal Reserve’s net liquidity has rebounded to 6,022.869, recovering strongly from its early-May low. Although it has not yet reached the key range of 6,100–6,200, this trend signals an initial return of liquidity, providing macro-level support for the crypto market. Despite last week’s long-bond auctions disappointing on both sides of the Pacific—with the U.S. 20-year yield pushed above 5 %, and Japan’s long-end rates setting 25-year highs—stoking global liquidity-squeeze fears, the impact is somewhat mitigated. The U.S. Treasury is primarily absorbing cash mainly via 3- to 6-month T-Bills, which tends to drain money-market funds rather than risk assets. Furthermore, the Fed retains the ability to pause quantitative tightening (QT) or open its repo facilities at will, capping potential spillover effects. Bitcoin has held firm. Spot ETFs continue to post modest daily inflows, over 70 % of Bitcoin supply has remained dormant for six months or more, exchange balances are falling, and Asian/Middle-East buyers continue to buy dips. Even if net Treasury issuance jumps to roughly $1.25 trillion in Q3, short-dated supply and repo backstops dilute the drag on high-beta assets, while ETF passive holdings and “hard hands” diffuse selling pressure; a weaker-dollar narrative adds further support. On-chain data shows that public chains like Solana and Base are seeing sustained increases in activity, with capital gradually shifting from BTC-dominated safe-haven assets to high-beta altcoins. BTC Dominance remains elevated and has not yet experienced a significant pullback, but if it drops below 52% in the coming sessions, coupled with further liquidity expansion, a new altcoin season could kick off. Analysis on Trending Sectors Wall Street Doubles Down on Crypto Credit: Maple Becomes the Institutional Capital Gateway Cantor Fitzgerald has launched a Bitcoin-collateralized credit program with a total size of $2 billion, signaling Wall Street’s formal and large-scale entry into the crypto credit market. Initial recipients of this facility include crypto broker FalconX and the decentralized lending protocol Maple Finance. FalconX has already drawn over $100 million under this framework, and Maple Finance has completed its first loan issuance through the program. The $SYRUP token , associated with Maple Finance, is available on HTX through spot trading, perpetual futures, and earn products. Since its spot listing, $SYRUP has surged by 110%, with strong performance also seen in derivatives—underscoring growing market recognition and investor confidence in the project. Maple’s newly launched syrupUSDC/USDT perpetual institutional credit pool offers 8–12% annual yields with high collateral transparency, rapidly attracting large volumes of idle institutional stablecoins. This month, the TVL surged from $800 million to $1.3 billion—markets are “voting with their feet,” fully validating the appeal and growth potential of the SYRUP model. InfoFi Rising Star: $COOKIE Poised to Trigger the Next Revaluation Cycle Based on current on-chain trends and macro liquidity data, $COOKIE is expected to be on the verge of explosive growth within the InfoFi sector. Compared to similarly positioned projects like Kaito, CookieDotFun’s current market cap is just one-fifth. Once the Cookie leaderboard, ad slot bidding, and other InfoFi monetization mechanisms go live, $COOKIE’ valuation ceiling could be lifted. HTX has launched COOKIE/USDT perpetual futures , while KAITO —previously featured in the HTX DeepThink column—has also been listed on HTX , with a remarkable 138% gain over the past 30 days. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

2025-05-29T05:38:40.000Z,"Litecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, Bitcoin, Dogecoin Or Mantix? Which Is The Best Pick For Maximum Gains?","The post Litecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, Bitcoin, Dogecoin Or Mantix? Which Is The Best Pick For Maximum Gains? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Top investors looking for the best cryptos to buy in 2025 are paying attention to Litecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Mantix. Hedge Fund managers are making big moves into crypto and with crypto presales powered by AI craze gaining traction in 2025, now may be the last chance to get positioned for immense returns. In the broader market, Bitcoin continues to break through to new highs dragging along other top altcoins. Most altcoins are showing positive signals and Mantix has led the way by raising $600,000 in its presale in just weeks. Let’s look at some of the most popular assets and explain why Mantix is set to rise 100x shortly. Litecoin slumps amidst waning interest Litecoin has had it rough with the LTC price falling by 2.1% in the past 24 hours to $95.65 , due to general market pressures and a negative technical forecast. The SEC postponed its decisions on spot Litecoin ETFs from Canary Capital and Grayscale, now planning to decide in late 2025. This lowered the earlier odds of Litecoin’s ETF approval on Polymarket from 90% to 76% as of today. Yet, people remain optimistic, with analysts aiming for a push to $120 by Q3. Litecoin still remains a good choice for conservative traders. Current Litecoin price action suggests LTC will continue its slow grind higher, especially if Bitcoin keeps building momentum. Legal clarity improves Ripple price outlook With Ripple’s legal win versus the SEC, XRP is once again attracting massive investor interest. The price is now trading around $2.34, up 6% in the past month and consolidating after an unprecedented March surge. Market analysts have adjusted their Ripple price predictions, with the new target being a move towards $3.20 if the overall market sentiment heralded by Bitcoin’s surge above ATH remains positive. Ripple’s cross-border payment technology is already being implemented by a number of central banks, and if ETFs pegged to XRP are greenlighted later this year, prices could take off leaving Ripple as a formidable contender in 2025’s list of best crypto to buy. Solana and Tron are making their networks more stable by minting USDT. Both Solana and Tron are making a name for themselves as reliable and fast blockchains, with similar goals in scalability, affordable transactions and a strong DeFi sector. Solana and Tron rely on hybrid consensus methods PoH, PoS and DPoS respectively to handle thousands of transactions at once, making them suitable for stablecoin use. Since January 2025, Tether’s USDT has been minted in large amounts on both Tron ($3 billion) and Solana ($7.75 billion in USDC, a USDT rival), according to Spot On Chain data. The mints make trading and using DeFi smooth, since Tron’s fixed $1 fee and Solana’s very low fees guarantee cost savings. Analysts expect Solana to increase to $290-$364 by late 2025 and Tron’s strong use cases could see it reach $0.40 if stablecoin adoption and Tron’s gasless USDT transfers continue. Bitcoin and Dogecoin prove to be crypto’s steady giants; is there more upside to come? Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $109,500 after rebounding from April’s $74,000 dip, with analysts eyeing $120,000 soon and possibly $325,000 by July 2026. Top analysts from Coincodex and Standard Chartered project Bitcoin to hit $170,000–$200,000 by year-end. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has remained relevant thanks to its community loyal to its OG meme status. Many market experts believe Dogecoin is a dependable “crypto giant” that could still bring high ROI, as long as the overall crypto market keeps growing. Together, BTC and DOGE reflect crypto’s dual appeal: institutional trust and cultural relevance. Mantix is 2025’s unicorn set for explosive returns Among all the viable competitors for crypto investment in 2025, Mantix represents the highest-upside play for life-changing returns. The product is a new decentralized trading platform that combines deep liquidity, high-leverage futures of up to 1000x and zero-downtime. Mantix also offers instant buyback-and-burn mechanisms and revenue sharing for $MTX token holders, perks even top exchanges rarely offer. Mantix has come out with a new ICO currently in its first Stage. Right now, the $MTX token can be purchased for just $0.02, with more than $600,000 already invested by early believers. Unlike most of the top altcoins, Mantix is still under the mainstream radar, giving early adopters a first-mover advantage. When comparing user rewards, decentralization and token use case, Mantix is better positioned than most in the top 10 altcoins making it the best option for savvy investors looking for the best returns.

2025-05-29T05:35:08.000Z,"New Document: Bank of France Prefers XRP Features to Issuing Europe’s CBDC","A recent tweet by crypto researcher SMQKE has reignited attention on France’s ongoing exploration of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), highlighting the country’s apparent preference for the XRP Ledger’s architecture as a model for its digital currency ambitions. Citing official documentation and statements from French authorities, the tweet states: “Remember, the Bank of France ‘prefers’ the features of XRP to issue Europe’s Central Bank Digital Currency. Documented.” The documentation in question includes a report from Piper Alderman referencing a publication by CPA Australia, which states that France has “openly discussed Ripple/XRP as a possible platform to Europe’s central digital currency.” The report underscores the appeal of XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) due to its highly centralised architecture and permissioned network capabilities. These characteristics stand in contrast to open, public blockchain networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which, while decentralised, are less suitable for central banking requirements concerning transaction privacy, speed, and regulatory control. Remember, the Bank of France “prefers” the features of XRP to issue Europe’s Central Bank Digital Currency. Documented. https://t.co/DDvBlO58Cb pic.twitter.com/BX1HKzAkvg — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 28, 2025 XRP Ledger Highlighted for Its Permissioned Network and Centralised Design The XRP Ledger’s design offers a compelling framework for central banks, allowing only authorised validators to confirm transactions. This model enables a high level of control and compliance, which are essential for the issuance and management of digital currencies by state monetary authorities. According to the CPA Australia report, this configuration has earned XRP the trust of many banks that consider it a viable technological foundation for CBDCs. Ripple’s proposal, as highlighted in the Piper Alderman document, showcases how the XRP Ledger can meet critical requirements for speed and security that are not attainable with fully decentralised public networks. The same report adds that while some blockchain technologies may not align with CBDC goals, configurations like XRPL can still meet the high standards required for official monetary systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bank of France Emphasises Need for Secure Settlement Assets Further supporting this position is a recent speech delivered by Denis Beau, the First Deputy Governor of the Bank of France, at the Fintech R:Evolution summit in Paris on May 21, 2025. The speech, officially published by the Bank for International Settlements, outlines three pillars for developing the European financial ecosystem, one of which is the tokenisation of finance. Beau confirmed that the lack of a secure settlement asset is currently impeding tokenized finance in Europe. In response, he stated that the Eurosystem has committed to providing a wholesale CBDC by 2026 to meet this need. The Bank of France has identified that integrating such a secure asset is crucial not only for domestic financial stability but also for ensuring Europe’s monetary sovereignty. In this context, the suitability of platforms like the XRP Ledger becomes especially relevant. As the documentation notes, Ripple’s proposal demonstrates how certain configurations of blockchain technology can satisfy the security, efficiency, and scalability requirements for CBDC implementation. France Positions Itself as a Leader in European CBDC Development Denis Beau also emphasized the importance of harmonized regulatory frameworks such as MiCA and the Pilot Regime in facilitating the growth of tokenized assets across Europe. He pointed out that despite progress, significant obstacles remain, particularly the need for central bank-backed infrastructure to enable safe and scalable blockchain-based financial systems. The formal inclusion of market representatives in discussions about regulatory implementation and technological deployment signals a coordinated effort by French and European financial authorities to shape the digital economy. Beau concluded his speech by stating his conviction that the French ecosystem has strong potential in developing high-value-added CBDC use cases. XRP Features Align with Eurozone’s Digital Currency Vision Taken together, the statements from the Bank of France, the referenced CPA Australia report, and the documentation shared by SMQKE converge on a central message: the features of the XRP Ledger align closely with the operational demands of a European CBDC. While no final platform has been officially designated, XRP’s architecture remains under active consideration by key monetary authorities in Europe.

2025-05-29T05:30:00.000Z,"US and UK Advance Crypto Regulations for Retirement and Custody","Two of the world’s leading financial regulators took significant steps this week toward formalizing the role of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance. In the United States, the Labor Department officially reversed its 2022 guidance discouraging crypto assets in 401(k) retirement plans, restoring fiduciary discretion for plan managers. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) opened a public consultation on proposed rules for stablecoins and crypto custody, aiming to support innovation while reinforcing market trust and consumer protection. US Labor Department Rescinds Biden-Era Crypto Retirement Investment Limits in Major Shift The US Department of Labor has formally rescinded a 2022 guidance that discouraged the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans, signaling a major pivot in federal retirement investment policy and reflecting a broader pro-crypto shift under the Trump administration. The announcement, made on May 28, revokes a controversial compliance bulletin that had urged fiduciaries to “exercise extreme care” when considering digital assets for retirement offerings. At the time, the Biden-era agency cited volatility, valuation uncertainty, and security risks as key reasons for opposing crypto exposure in employer-sponsored plans. But the current Labor Department, under Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, has now reversed that stance, calling the 2022 guidance an “overreach” and a break from the agency’s historically neutral approach to fiduciary responsibilities. The move is being framed as a return to a “principled-based” framework, in which plan managers, rather than federal regulators, assess whether digital assets are suitable for long-term retirement strategies. Chavez-DeRemer emphasized that fiduciaries are in the best position to weigh the merits and risks of cryptocurrencies based on the unique needs of plan participants, as opposed to receiving top-down prohibitive mandates from Washington. This change effectively grants retirement plan providers more discretion to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets in 401(k) offerings, potentially opening the door to broader mainstream adoption among long-term savers. The American Banking Association (ABA), which had previously criticized the 2022 guidance for being issued without public review or comment, applauded the rollback. The ABA argued that the prior administration’s action amounted to de facto rulemaking without transparency or due process. Backstory: A Cautious Past The original guidance issued in March 2022 by the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) was widely viewed as a chilling message to retirement providers. The memo warned that cryptocurrencies were speculative, volatile, and susceptible to fraud, and that offering them in 401(k) plans could place fiduciaries at legal risk under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). It also coincided with high-profile crypto market collapses, including the TerraUSD meltdown and the eventual implosion of FTX, which reinforced skepticism among regulators and the public. Several asset managers, including Fidelity Investments, pushed back against the guidance at the time, insisting that digital assets offered a valid diversification strategy, particularly for younger investors. Fidelity, one of the few major financial institutions to defy the Biden-era resistance, launched its Digital Assets Account (DAA) for 401(k)s in 2022, allowing plan sponsors to offer Bitcoin exposure to their employees. The investment giant structured the product with robust compliance measures and minimal fees, arguing that retirement savers deserved optional access to emerging asset classes. Fidelity’s pioneering effort sparked debate about whether mainstream investors should have crypto exposure in their retirement portfolios—debate that is likely to intensify in the wake of the Labor Department’s new stance. Broader Crypto Policy Under Trump The Labor Department's reversal is part of a larger trend under President Donald Trump’s current administration, which has adopted a decisively pro-crypto posture. Trump has pledged to make the US “the world capital of crypto,” and federal agencies have taken steps to dial back regulatory crackdowns on high-profile crypto platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap. Simultaneously, the administration has launched exploratory frameworks for tokenizing real-world assets ( RWAs ), such as bonds and commodities, and for defining clearer rules around digital asset classifications—efforts praised by many in the blockchain industry. Despite these advances, some lawmakers remain wary of the Trump administration’s close alignment with the crypto industry, citing the need for guardrails to prevent systemic risks and ensure retail investor protection. Critics have also called for more transparency regarding Trump's own business interests in the sector. The Labor Department's updated position does not constitute a blanket endorsement of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans. Rather, it shifts the responsibility and liability back to fiduciaries, who must still uphold their duty to act in the best interests of plan participants. Industry analysts expect many asset managers to proceed cautiously, balancing client demand with evolving legal and regulatory standards. Nevertheless, the reversal may pave the way for a surge in crypto retirement product development, including new portfolio options, managed funds, and potentially tokenized pension models in the coming years. UK’s FCA Unveils Draft Rules for Stablecoins and Crypto Custody, Opens Door to Public Feedback Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has taken another critical step toward formalizing its cryptocurrency regulatory framework. On May 28, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a consultation paper requesting public feedback on proposed regulations for stablecoins and crypto custody services. The initiative marks what the FCA described as a “milestone on the road to crypto regulation” as the UK pushes forward with plans to become a global leader in responsible digital asset innovation. The proposals aim to provide a robust and secure environment for crypto users and investors, while preserving the flexibility necessary for continued technological growth in the fintech space. The consultation will remain open in the coming weeks, inviting perspectives from both industry stakeholders and the general public. David Geale, Executive Director of Payments and Digital Finance at the FCA, emphasized the regulator’s dual commitment to innovation and integrity. “At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets,” Geale said. “At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.” The new proposals reflect extensive input from roundtable discussions, industry consultations, and the broader global movement toward regulated digital assets. The FCA acknowledged that while crypto has become increasingly integrated into the UK’s financial ecosystem, the lack of clear rules has left investors vulnerable and market participants operating in a legal grey area. One of the FCA’s core objectives is to ensure that regulated stablecoins maintain their promised peg to a fiat currency, such as the British pound or US dollar. Under the proposed rules, issuers of qualifying stablecoins would be legally obligated to honor 1:1 redemption rights at par value, regardless of the fluctuating value of backing asset portfolios. “We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency,” the FCA wrote, “with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.” To reinforce consumer protections, stablecoin issuers would be required to appoint independent, third-party custodians to safeguard their reserve assets. Issuers must also disclose clear and accessible information about the structure and quality of the asset backing. This push for transparency comes amid growing global scrutiny over stablecoin reserve practices, especially after the collapse of poorly backed stablecoins like TerraUSD in 2022 triggered industry-wide contagion. Coordination with the Bank of England The FCA is working in tandem with the Bank of England (BoE) to construct a comprehensive framework for stablecoins, especially those that could operate at systemic scale. Sarah Breeden, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the BoE, confirmed that the central bank will release a complementary consultation paper later this year. In a separate discussion paper, the FCA introduced sweeping new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services. These proposals are designed to bolster investor confidence by ensuring that crypto assets are held securely and remain readily accessible at all times. Custodians will be expected to follow strict internal controls, implement high-security measures, and maintain transparent procedures for asset segregation, incident reporting, and recovery mechanisms. The proposed rules also seek to reduce both the likelihood and impact of institutional failure, in direct response to previous collapses such as Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX, where customers faced prolonged access delays or complete loss of assets.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9355/us-and-uk-advance-crypto-regulations-for-retirement-and-custody,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

The BlackRock fund saw another large inflow day on May 28 with $481 million entering the ETF. This has culminated in 33 consecutive trading days without an outflow, the last of which was on April 9. Another nearly *$500mil* into iShares Bitcoin ETF… Starting to get ridiculous. Inflows 30 of past 31 days. Nearly $9.5bil in new $$$. IBIT comfortably in top 5 ETFs by inflows this year (out of 4,200+ ETFs). — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) May 29, 2025 Institutional Bitcoin Consumption IBIT is comfortably in the top 5 ETFs by inflows this year out of more than 4,200 funds, observed Geraci. Additionally, IBIT has seen $3.86 billion in inflows over the past fortnight, with a daily average of $430 million. In total, the fund has seen $48.8 billion in inflows since it launched in January 2024. It holds $71 billion in assets under management, which is equivalent to around 650,000 BTC. BlackRock was the only Bitcoin ETF to see an inflow on Wednesday, with Fidelity and Ark 21Shares outflowing $14 million and $34.3 million, respectively, according to Farside Investors. IBIT has been on fire lately, now has $72 billion in assets, which ranks it 23rd overall, “absolutely bonkers for a one-year-old,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The big BlackRock figures emphasize the sentiment that this rally is institutionally driven, as large corporations are also adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, the latest being GameStop , and retail appears to be absent . Balchunas opined that it feels like it’s inevitable that a “Big Boy US company” adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet soon. “Could definitely see Meta being the one to break the ice,” he added. “If a Meta or Microsoft adds BTC to its balance sheet, it will arguably have a bigger impact than all the smaller companies doing it, kinda like when Tom Hanks got COVID, everyone was like ‘oh shit Tom Hanks got it’ which made it feel real even tho the cases had already been mounting.” Crypto Market Outlook Spot markets have dipped 2% on the day, with total capitalization falling to $3.55 trillion. The fall has been led by Bitcoin, which failed to reclaim $108,000 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session and dipped 1% on the day. Ethereum was moving in the opposite direction, adding 4% on the day to top $2,750 at the time of writing, while most of the altcoins were flat.

2025-05-29T05:19:44.000Z,"Elon Musk leaves DOGE as job was ‘uphill battle’","Elon Musk confirmed that he’s quitting as the White House’s government cost-cutting czar after admitting it was an “uphill battle” trying to slash federal jobs and programs. Musk’s status as a Special Government Employee leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) meant that by law, he could only serve for a maximum of 130 days, which was set to finish on May 30. Musk confirmed his exit in a May 29 X post, thanking President Donald Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.” Reuters reported that a White House official said his “off-boarding will begin tonight.” Musk told The Washington Post for a May 27 report that the “federal bureaucracy situation is much worse” than he expected, and it was “an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.” In separate comments to CBS, Musk criticized the multi-trillion-dollar tax break package that House Republicans approved on May 22, claiming it would increase the budget deficit and undermine the work that DOGE is doing. DOGE, which is named after the cryptocurrency, claims to have saved taxpayers $175 billion since Trump’s Jan. 20 return to the White House, a figure heavily disputed by multiple news outlets, which report the figures are overstated, have multiple errors and are inaccurate. The project’s claimed savings are only 8.5% of Musk’s initial ambition to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, which he later revised down to $150 billion. According to the Reuters report, DOGE has cut almost 12%, or 260,000, of the 2.3 million federal workforce through layoffs, buyouts and early retirement offers. Despite the criticisms, Musk said on X that DOGE’s mission will “only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” Source: Elon Musk It comes as a federal judge allowed a lawsuit to proceed that accuses Musk and DOGE of illegally exerting power over government operations. The lawsuit, filed by 14 states, alleged that Musk and DOGE violated the Constitution by illegally accessing government data systems, terminating federal employees and canceling contracts at federal agencies. Musk admits he spent too much time in politics In a May 28 interview with Ars Technica, Musk, the CEO of EV maker Tesla, admitted that he spent “a bit too much time” in politics, which some critics claim has impacted Tesla’s performance . “I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics,” Musk said. However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement. “It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.” When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income. As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin ( BTC ), currently valued at about $1.24 billion. Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launch Tesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter. However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.

JUST IN: The SEC has delayed the Cardano $ADA ETF decision to a later date. https://t.co/DFftBwtodG — TapTools (@TapTools) May 28, 2025 Cardano slipped 4% and AVAX dropped over 2% after the news. A favorable decision was expected to push ADA past the $0.80 mark. However, the delay could now negatively impact the price. The MACD and short-term averages indicate selling pressure, but the long-term outlook is still positive for ADA. Traders on Polymarket are still positive, as it shows a 67% chance of a Cardano ETF approval by the year-end. The community is not surprised, as some see these setbacks as buying opportunities. They say that the regulators may slow the process, but they cannot stop the technology or the believers who keep accumulating. Grayscale filed for the Cardano Trust listing with NYSE Arca in February 2025, then updated the proposal for public feedback. The SEC had 45 days to decide, but pushed the deadline from April 14 to May 29, and now it’s delayed again. However, Cardano is back on eToro’s trading platform as it joined 12 other cryptocurrencies. This comes after eToro paid a $1.5 million fine to the SEC, settling issues that caused ADA to be delisted in 2021.

The pattern in question is a triangle from technical analysis (TA). This type of channel emerges when the price of an asset observes consolidation between two trendlines that converge at some common point. The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance, while the lower one is a source of support. Related Reading: Ethereum May Be One Dip Away From Mass Losses—Data Warns There are a few different types of triangles in TA, with the most popular ones being the ascending, descending, and symmetrical variations. The arrangement of the trendlines dictates which type of asset the asset is following. When one of the trendlines is parallel to the time-axis, one of the former two appears. The ascending variation forms when consolidation is toward a net upside. That is, when the upper line is flat and the lower one is sloped upward. Similarly, the descending one involves the opposite orientation. The third type, the symmetrical triangle, has both of the trendlines angled at an equal and opposite slope. In this variation, consolidation narrows down to a point in a sideways manner. In triangle patterns, a breakout from one of the trendlines often ends up being around the same length as the height of the triangle (that is, the distance between the upper and lower line at their extreme). Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the triangle that Shiba Inu’s 4-hour price has been moving inside over the last few weeks: From the graph, it would appear that the triangle that Shiba Inu has been inside recently is of the descending type, as its price has overall been moving down over this timeframe. Based on the pattern, Martinez has noted that SHIB could be heading toward a 17% swing. Related Reading: How Does Bitcoin Investor Behavior Shape Trends? Glassnode Reveals But which way could this move appear in? Generally, a descending triangle is considered to be a continuation pattern for a bearish trend. It can also, however, sometimes act as a reversal pattern, with a breakout coming in the upward direction instead. At present, Shiba Inu is sitting near the midway point between the two trendlines. As such, it only remains to be seen which of the two lines it might visit next. As the consolidation lengthens, the triangular channel is only getting tighter, so one way or the other, a break may occur soon. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.00001436, down about 2% in the last seven days.

Source: K33 K33 CEO Bull Jenssen posted to X on May 28 that he thinks Bitcoin will be the “best-performing asset in the coming decade,” and his company will “accumulate as many as possible while unlocking powerful operational synergies with our brokerage operation.” “Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build you own? Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028.

In a May 28 Bloomberg TV interview , Behnam sided with the crypto industry on its long-standing argument that cryptocurrencies are commodities. “If you look at existing law, the few largest tokens are commodities, which means the SEC does not have jurisdiction over those tokens, which include Bitcoin and Ether,” he said. He added that the Securities and Exchange Commission currently cannot properly regulate crypto because its law doesn’t allow it to regulate commodities, and the CFTC cannot regulate because it is a derivatives regulator. Without new authority for the CFTC to regulate “cash markets in digital assets, non-securities,” this will remain an unregulated space, he claimed. Rostin Behnam on Bloomberg TV. Source: Bloomberg Behnam comments amid increasing scrutiny of the Trump family’s crypto ventures, which include the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, memecoins and a stablecoin. On May 28, American political strategist and political commentator Sanders Townsend said Donald Trump is boosting his family’s investments in cryptocurrency and “is using the presidency to do it.” The administration’s involvement in the regulatory process and legislative effort is “raising red flags” among some members of Congress, and there are “well-baked rules” for any elected or appointed government official that need to be complied with, he said. “Ultimately, until we do something, the [crypto] market will remain unregulated. Customers, investors, retail and institutional, will be more vulnerable to harm, fraud, manipulation and conflicts of interest, until the market is regulated.” Regulation critical to financial markets, says Behnam Behnam also weighed in on Vice President JD Vance’s speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, backing up the need for crypto regulations. Related: Trump’s use of presidential seal at memecoin event raises legal questions Vance said in a speech at the event that “we reject regulators” and that crypto “has a champion” in the White House. “Regulators are extremely important,” Behnam said. “They’re the reason American markets are the most desired in the world.” “Consumer protections and enforcement of the law are extremely critical to the health of our financial markets,” he added.

2025-05-29T04:01:20.000Z,"El Salvador Secures IMF Deal, Retains Bitcoin Holdings Amid Fiscal Changes","El Salvador and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have reached a staff-level agreement on the first review of the country’s 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. The agreement is pending approval by the IMF’s Executive Board and is dependent on the implementation of agreed-upon conditions. Progress and Fiscal Reforms According to a joint statement from IMF officials Rodrigo Cubeddu and Luis Torres, El Salvador’s early performance under the program has been strong. The country has met key fiscal and reserve targets while steadily advancing governance and financial resilience reforms. “The authorities have made significant progress in implementing their economic reform plan under the IMF-supported program. Most program targets set for the first review were comfortably met, and implementation of the structural benchmarks is progressing well,” said the officials. They added that the nation’s economy continued to expand, supported by investor confidence and resilient remittance inflows. The statement also emphasized the importance of maintaining momentum on fiscal consolidation and structural changes to address macroeconomic imbalances and support sustainable growth. Under the deal, El Salvador will continue its fiscal tightening measures. These include cuts to the public wage bill, restrained current spending, and upcoming civil service and pension system updates. The efforts will be supported by the upcoming Fiscal Sustainability Law, with the government also planning to increase deposits at the country’s central bank to boost external reserves. IMF Doubles Down on Bitcoin Stance Despite the progress, the IMF reiterated its concerns about El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy. It stated that efforts were being made to ensure the government does not add to its BTC holdings. “On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the statement read. Additionally, steps are underway to phase out public sector involvement in the Chivo wallet by the end of July. In December 2024, the two parties struck a $1.4 billion deal that included conditions to limit the nation’s crypto-related activities. The deal required BTC’s acceptance in El Salvador’s private sector to remain voluntary and restricted public sector involvement in related transactions. These conditions were later integrated into national policy through amendments to the Bitcoin Law approved by El Salvador’s Congress. The IMF Executive Board then approved the financing deal in February 2025, allowing an initial disbursement of $120 million, subject to approval. Despite the required limitations on crypto engagement, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office has continued its strategy of buying one BTC per day. As of May 28, 2025, the country holds approximately 6,190 BTC, valued at around $675 million. President Nayib Bukele has also publicly stated that cryptocurrency remains a central part of his vision for the nation.

2025-05-29T04:00:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest – Is A Second Wave Coming?","Recently, Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980 on Binance crypto exchange, surpassing its previous ATH of $108,786 recorded in January 2025. However, this rally is missing a crucial element that has historically fuelled sustained bull markets – retail investor participation. Bitcoin Rally Low On Retail Interest According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, retail activity during the current BTC rally is notably subdued. This is unusual, as fresh ATHs typically draw significant attention from smaller investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? The analyst shared the following chart highlighting this trend. It shows that BTC transfer volume in the $0 to $10,000 range – a proxy for retail demand – has only seen a slight uptick, even as prices surge. While Bitcoin’s price has been climbing steadily (white line), the 30-day percentage change in retail demand (green line) has remained largely flat. This indicates that the current momentum is likely driven by institutional investors, with retail participants yet to join in meaningfully. Recent developments support this view. For instance, institutional heavyweight Strategy continues to increase its BTC holdings, now closing in on the 600,000 BTC mark. Historical patterns – particularly from the 2020–2021 bull run – suggest that while institutional accumulation often kicks off a rally, retail investors are typically the fuel that propels it to sustained highs. Without significant retail volume, the current rally may lose steam. Concluding, the CryptoQuant analyst stated that for BTC to continue its price expansion, a clear uptick in retail participation is necessary. They added: We’re seeing early signs of movement, but it’s not yet a breakout. If retail volume kicks in over the next few weeks, new ATHs may just be the beginning. Predicting BTC’s Next Move Recent flows from crypto exchanges show that BTC reserves are dwindling at a fast pace. For instance, US-based exchange Coinbase recently saw a new outflow of 7,883 BTC, raising speculations of institutions loading up on the apex digital asset before its next leg up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Elevated Unrealized Profits Without Signs Of Panic Selling – New ATH Soon? Similarly, technicals point toward BTC hitting another ATH soon. The top cryptocurrency by market cap recently broke out of a double bottom pattern on the hourly chart, fuelling hopes of a surge toward the $112,000 mark. Meanwhile, whale behavior has been mixed. While short-term whales have taken profits, long-term holders remain steadfast, showing minimal signs of selling. That said, BTC’s medium-term outlook remains overwhelmingly positive, with some researchers predicting a $200,000 price target by the end of 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $108,802, down 0.6% in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-29T03:57:45.000Z,"Pakistan to Set Up Bitcoin Reserve, Echoing US Crypto Strategy","Pakistan has announced the creation of a government-led Bitcoin strategic reserve, marking a dramatic reversal from its previous anti-crypto stance and signaling its intent to become a serious player in the global digital asset arena. Bilal bin Saqib , head of the Pakistan Crypto Council, revealed the initiative at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. While addressing a packed audience, Saqib credited the US for leading the way. “Today is a very historic day,” he said. “I announce the Pakistani government is setting up its own government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. And we want to thank the United States of America again because we were inspired by them.” Today, rewrites history.

It also did not specify how much Bitcoin would be held. However, Saqib made it clear that the holdings are not meant for speculation. “We will be holding these Bitcoins and we will never, ever sell them,” he said. Pakistan Reverses Course on Crypto as Global Momentum Builds Just two years ago, Pakistan’s finance ministry declared that cryptocurrencies would never be legalized. Since then, global attitudes toward digital assets have shifted. As a result, that position has softened considerably in 2025. Countries including the US, under President Donald Trump, have moved to embrace blockchain, influencing Pakistan’s change in stance. Now, Pakistan’s pivot is part of a broader national strategy. Notably, the formation of the Pakistan Crypto Council earlier this year marked a major step in building out the country’s crypto infrastructure. Led by Saqib and advised by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao , the council aims to drive blockchain innovation and expand the use of stablecoins and decentralized finance within Pakistan’s financial systems. WLF Agreement, Federal Budget Plans Show Pakistan’s Crypto Focus In April, Pakistan signed a Letter of Intent with US-based World Liberty Financial . The crypto firm is backed by financial interests linked to former US President Donald Trump’s family. The agreement outlines collaboration on asset tokenization, stablecoin development and DeFi regulatory frameworks. It followed high-level meetings with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Army Chief General Asim Munir and senior WLF executives. Further, the government has also committed 2,000 megawatts of power for crypto mining and AI infrastructure. This move is expected to support large-scale digital operations. In addition, a legal framework for digital asset regulation is currently being developed. It is likely to be introduced in the upcoming federal budget. Taken together, these efforts reflect a strategic national push. With 25m active crypto users and an annual transaction volume of $300b, according to Chainalysis, Pakistan is working to establish itself as a credible player in the global crypto landscape.

2025-05-29T03:39:13.000Z,"HTX DeepThink: Rotation Signals Emerging—Crypto Credit and InfoFi Poised as New Market Focal Points","As May draws to a close, the crypto market continues its upward momentum, fueled by a renewed wave of macro liquidity. Bitcoin demonstrates resilience, with improved on-chain capital structure and a steady rise in risk appetite. High-beta assets and quality altcoins are drawing increasing attention, signaling an emerging rotation trend. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research explores the evolving potential and structural value of crypto credit and InfoFi as key sectors in this next phase. Structural Shift Under Macro Support: Bitcoin Holds Firm as Altseason Builds Momentum As of May 21, 2025, the Federal Reserve’s net liquidity has rebounded to 6,022.869, recovering strongly from its early-May low. Although it has not yet reached the key range of 6,100–6,200, this trend signals an initial return of liquidity, providing macro-level support for the crypto market. Despite last week’s long-bond auctions disappointing on both sides of the Pacific—with the U.S. 20-year yield pushed above 5 %, and Japan’s long-end rates setting 25-year highs—stoking global liquidity-squeeze fears, the impact is somewhat mitigated. The U.S. Treasury is primarily absorbing cash mainly via 3- to 6-month T-Bills, which tends to drain money-market funds rather than risk assets. Furthermore, the Fed retains the ability to pause quantitative tightening (QT) or open its repo facilities at will, capping potential spillover effects. Bitcoin has held firm. Spot ETFs continue to post modest daily inflows, over 70 % of Bitcoin supply has remained dormant for six months or more, exchange balances are falling, and Asian/Middle-East buyers continue to buy dips. Even if net Treasury issuance jumps to roughly $1.25 trillion in Q3, short-dated supply and repo backstops dilute the drag on high-beta assets, while ETF passive holdings and “hard hands” diffuse selling pressure; a weaker-dollar narrative adds further support. On-chain data shows that public chains like Solana and Base are seeing sustained increases in activity, with capital gradually shifting from BTC-dominated safe-haven assets to high-beta altcoins. BTC Dominance remains elevated and has not yet experienced a significant pullback, but if it drops below 52% in the coming sessions, coupled with further liquidity expansion, a new altcoin season could kick off. Analysis on Trending Sectors Wall Street Doubles Down on Crypto Credit: Maple Becomes the Institutional Capital Gateway Cantor Fitzgerald has launched a Bitcoin-collateralized credit program with a total size of $2 billion. signaling Wall Street’s formal and large-scale entry into the crypto credit market. Initial recipients of this facility include crypto broker FalconX and the decentralized lending protocol Maple Finance. FalconX has already drawn over $100 million under this framework, and Maple Finance has completed its first loan issuance through the program. The $SYRUP token , associated with Maple Finance, is available on HTX through spot trading, perpetual futures, and earn products. Since its spot listing, $SYRUP has surged by 110%, with strong performance also seen in derivatives—underscoring growing market recognition and investor confidence in the project. Maple’s newly launched syrupUSDC/USDT perpetual institutional credit pool offers 8–12% annual yields with high collateral transparency, rapidly attracting large volumes of idle institutional stablecoins. This month, the TVL surged from $800 million to $1.3 billion—markets are “voting with their feet,” fully validating the appeal and growth potential of the SYRUP model. InfoFi Rising Star: $COOKIE Poised to Trigger the Next Revaluation Cycle Based on current on-chain trends and macro liquidity data, $COOKIE is expected to be on the verge of explosive growth within the InfoFi sector. Compared to similarly positioned projects like Kaito, CookieDotFun’s current market cap is just one-fifth. Once the Cookie leaderboard, ad slot bidding, and other InfoFi monetization mechanisms go live, $COOKIE’ valuation ceiling could be lifted. HTX has launched COOKIE/USDT perpetual futures , while KAITO —previously featured in the HTX DeepThink column—has also been listed on HTX , with a remarkable 138% gain over the past 30 days. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

The crypto market remained unscathed, despite the stock drops among crypto miners. Uncertainty about the economic outlook looms The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on May 6 and 7, released on May 28, stated, “the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proves to be more persistent while the outlooks for growth and employment weaken.” The Fed had decided after its meetings in early May to keep interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, with the minutes revealing the reason was due to “a further increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and a rise in the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation.” Riot Platforms (RIOT) closed the May 28 trading day down 8.32%, CleanSpark (CLSK) tumbled 7.61%, and Mara Holdings closed down 9.61%, according to Google Finance data. MARA Holdings bounced back 2.56% in after-hours trading.

The S&P 500 declined 0.56% over the trading day. Tension between Trump and the Fed It comes after recent tension between US President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve, following Trump’s public criticism of the Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. On April 17, Trump said, “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Related: Bitcoin sags below $108K as rate-cut bets evaporate before Fed minutes The crypto market remained relatively stable over the same period.

2025-05-29T03:00:43.000Z,"Bitcoin Set For 50%+ Move Within 6 Months, Says Hedge Fund Boss","Bitcoin is currently changing hands just above $108,000, consolidating after Tuesday’s fresh all-time high. Charles Edwards, founder of the digital-asset hedge fund Capriole Investments, believes that price could be at least 50% higher by November. In his latest market note, “Saddle Up,” released on 27 May, the manager argues that a rare confluence of macro, technical and on-chain factors has created “the most bullish technical setup we could ask for for Bitcoin at all-time highs.” Bitcoin 50% Rally Is “Conservative” Edwards first set the stage for the call in late April, when Bitcoin was trading near $93,000. “We noted the bullish Bitcoin setup and expectation to be ‘pushing new all-time highs quite soon’,” he recalled. One month later the market has risen 16%, validating that view and, in Edwards’s telling, clearing the decks for the next leg higher. Central to the thesis is what Edwards dubs the “Hard Asset Era.” A breakout in the Gold-to-S&P 500 ratio above its 200-week moving average signals that investors are again favouring scarce stores of value over equities. Historically, such regimes are “sticky,” he writes, adding that the ensuing outperformance of gold over stocks has ranged from 150% to 650% in past cycles. “If you think gold has already rallied a lot, think again,” Edwards said. On that analogue, Bitcoin — which tends to lag gold by several months — could be poised for even steeper gains. Related Reading: US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief Recent policy changes have underpinned the rotation. Basel III rules elevated gold to Tier-1 reserve status in 2022, forcing banks to back paper positions with physical metal, while last year’s approvals of spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds opened institutional flood-gates to the cryptocurrency. Washington’s creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in early 2025 provided an additional layer of state-level legitimacy. Against the same backdrop, persistent inflation, tariff frictions and the precedent of freezing Russian foreign-exchange reserves have catalysed demand for politically neutral assets. Bitcoin Technicals And Fundamental From a market-structure standpoint, Bitcoin’s April slide to $75,000 and sharp recovery above $90,000 is described as a text-book “fake-out” — a failed breakdown that often precedes powerful upside trends. The weekly close reclaim above $90,000 “marked the start of a new trend,” Edwards contends, making the $104,000 level the first line of defence. “As long as price is above $104K, this is the most bullish technical setup we could ask for,” he wrote, reducing near-term risk management to a single number. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock Capriole’s machine-learning-driven Bitcoin Macro Index, which blends more than 100 on-chain, macro and equity-market variables, continues to register in “bullish growth.” Apparent demand (production minus dormant supply) has turned positive, US liquidity remains supportive, and Capriole’s new “Volume Summer” metric shows trend-confirming expansion in trading activity. Taken together with the historical three-to-five-month lag between gold breakouts and Bitcoin rallies, the firm argues that “a 50 %-plus rise over the next six months is a conservative target.” Policy Wild-Cards The clearest threats to the projection lie on the policy front. Edwards highlights a 30- to 60-day window for the United States to strike tariff compromises with China and the European Union; failure could dent risk appetite. He also warns that the flourishing “Bitcoin-treasury arbitrage” — whereby corporates issue low-cost debt to accumulate BTC — could amplify downside in a future deleveraging, though leverage levels remain manageable for now. For the moment, however, the combination of a hard-asset bull cycle, confirmed technical strength and improving fundamentals keeps Capriole “very optimistic about the mid- to long-term potential for both gold and Bitcoin.” As long as the market holds above that $104,000 weekly pivot, Edwards suggests investors should — in his own closing words — “saddle up.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,005.

2025-05-29T02:15:21.000Z,"Qubetics Might Be the Last Presale You’ll Regret Not Joining—Like SUI","The cryptocurrency ecosystem is experiencing another major shift. With Bitcoin stabilizing above critical resistance zones and Ethereum showing renewed strength, early buyers are recalibrating portfolios and aggressively seeking undervalued opportunities. In the aftermath of SUI’s meteoric rise, many find themselves reflecting on missed chances. The window to early entry has closed, and the market’s attention is shifting. In this new wave of momentum, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged not just as a promising presale—but as a technology platform purpose-built to resolve the persistent issues that hindered earlier blockchain projects. While SUI advanced the architecture of high-throughput Layer 1s, Qubetics delivers real-world applications through interoperability, decentralization, and unmatched user flexibility. With a presale that has already raised over millions, the narrative is clear: this project is quickly becoming the most popular cryptocurrency among informed adopters. Qubetics: A Strategic Entry into Practical Web3 Innovation For those who missed SUI, Qubetics offers a rare opportunity to enter at the ground level of a project engineered for real-world adoption. Positioned as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics brings cross-chain interoperability, a user-centric non-custodial wallet, and advanced transaction capabilities into one seamless ecosystem. Currently in its 36th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $17.5 million in contributions. The token, priced at $0.3064, has drawn widespread attention due to its strong performance metrics and expansive roadmap. Over 514 million $TICS have been sold to a rapidly growing community of over 27,200 holders—clear evidence of market confidence. At the heart of Qubetics lies its multi-chain, non-custodial wallet application—designed for professionals, businesses, and everyday users who require flexibility, speed, and control over their digital assets. This wallet allows seamless asset management across various blockchains without requiring multiple interfaces or custodial intermediaries. A digital design agency accepting global payments can simplify accounting by aggregating multi-chain revenues in a single dashboard. There’s no need for constant wallet switching or managing several DeFi apps. One of the most compelling aspects of Qubetics lies in its wealth-building potential. With $TICS currently priced at $0.3064 during the presale, projections for post-launch returns are turning heads across the investment community. If $TICS reaches $1, early participants could secure a return on investment of 226%. Should the token climb to $5, the ROI surges to 1,531%. At $6, that jumps to 1,858%, while a $10 valuation would represent an astonishing 3,163% return. And if $TICS hits $15 following the mainnet launch, early holders could see a remarkable 4,795% ROI. Investing in $TICS at this stage isn’t merely speculation—it’s securing a position in the backbone of tomorrow’s decentralized web. Qubetics addresses the usability gap left by earlier platforms and positions itself as the most popular cryptocurrency for practical Web3 deployment. SUI: A Breakthrough with Limited Access SUI, developed by Mysten Labs, introduced an advanced Layer 1 blockchain architecture that utilized the Move programming language and parallel transaction execution. Its design offered significant scalability improvements and real-time finality—ideal for decentralized applications in gaming, DeFi, and NFTs. The launch was widely anticipated and gained substantial traction, particularly among developers seeking new, high-performance chains. For builders, this means longer timelines. For early buyers, it introduces uncertainty and missed compounding opportunities. This scenario has become familiar: a groundbreaking concept launches, early access is limited, and by the time the broader market is onboard, the upside potential has largely diminished. It’s a pattern that defines many most popular cryptocurrency projects in hindsight. Conclusion: An Opportunity That Demands Action History rewards those who act with foresight. While SUI delivered exceptional performance, many were excluded from its earliest and most profitable stages. Qubetics presents a fresh opportunity—with advanced technology, a clear roadmap, and significant backing. The next most popular cryptocurrency is unlikely to resemble the last. It will solve new problems, unlock new efficiencies, and deliver returns to those who recognize its value early. Do not allow another opportunity to pass by unnoticed. Participate in the Qubetics presale, evaluate its utility, and secure a position before the narrative changes again. This is a rare convergence of timing, technology, and upside potential. And for those who take action now, the rewards may be transformative.

2025-05-29T02:01:04.000Z,"XRP Price Prediction Today: A Dip Below $2 Could Be Next","The post XRP Price Prediction Today: A Dip Below $2 Could Be Next appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The price of XRP, much like the rest of the crypto market, is facing a short-term pullback. On the daily time frame, XRP has been losing momentum as Bitcoin cools off, and since most altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead, XRP is no exception. When Bitcoin dips or moves sideways, altcoins often react with sharper drops, and that’s exactly what’s happening now. Bitcoin dominance is currently quite strong, which means Bitcoin is holding its value better than many altcoins. This puts added pressure on coins like XRP, which are now struggling to stay above important support levels. Recently, XRP slipped below a key support area around $2.30. Is There a Bullish Pattern Forming? With this level lost, analysts are now keeping a close eye on the next important zone, which sits between $2.10 and $2.15. If XRP fails to hold here, the next significant level to watch would be around $2.00, and below that, there’s some support near $1.80. Interestingly, there’s a bullish setup forming on the daily chart. There are early signs of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is a classic reversal formation that could hint at a bigger move to the upside. Short-Term Outlook However, for this pattern to actually play out, XRP would need to stabilize somewhere in the lower $2 range, likely between $2.00 and $2.15, before bouncing back towards $2.62. A confirmed breakout above this higher level would be a strong bullish signal, possibly opening the door to new highs. But for now, this pattern is only a possibility and not confirmed. In the shorter time frames, XRP has also lost a bit of positive momentum. A short-term bullish divergence recently failed as the price and RSI both made lower lows, canceling out the divergence. This signals the potential for further downside in the immediate term, with the next likely stop being around the $2.10 area.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-today-a-dip-below-2-could-be-next/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T02:00:05.000Z,"Bitcoin Diamond Hands Are Buying Again, Here’s Why It’s Bullish For The Market","Bitcoin has spent the last five days trading within a relatively narrow range between $106,229 and $111,807, following its recent all-time high of $111,814. Despite the increase in selling pressure from miners after the all-time high, the price of Bitcoin has managed to hold above $108,000, with on-chain data showing Bitcoin diamond hands absorbing all the selling pressure. Long-Term Holders Accumulating With Minimal Spending According to data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Spending Binary Indicator has fallen to its lowest level since September 2024. This interesting trend was initially noted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst Alex Adler Jr. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next The 15-day moving average of this metric, as shown in the chart by CryptoQuant, has dropped to the minimal spending zone. Notably, this zone has consistently preceded a more bullish move in the Bitcoin price. In parallel, long-term holder supply has risen by approximately 300,000 BTC over the past 20 days. This marks a deviation from the trend of declines in the long-term holder supply since 2024. At the time of writing, 14.6 million BTC, representing about 74% of the total current circulating supply of BTC, is in addresses classified as long-term holders. This pattern suggests that so-called “diamond hands”, i.e., investors with a strong conviction who hold through volatility, are not only refraining from selling with Bitcoin’s recent new peak, but are actively accumulating. The chart below shows the correlation between minimal LTH spending and rising price action, a behavior that also aligned with phases of Bitcoin’s uptrend in 2019, late 2020, and late 2024. Why It’s Bullish For The Market The significant uptick in long-term holder supply, combined with minimal selling activity, reveals a hidden strength in the market. The current behavior of long-term investors also indicates their confidence in Bitcoin’s valuation at current levels, despite the recent price surge. Many of these long-term holders are in substantial profit, yet still choose to hold. This is unlike short-term holders, who have collectively realized over $11.6 billion in profits over the past month alone. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Drawing a parallel with historical data, the current decline in long-term holder (LTH) spending mirrors a similar pattern observed in September 2024. At that time, the LTH Indicator was in the minimal zone, and the long-term holder supply was also increasing steadily. What followed was a remarkable 96% surge in Bitcoin’s price, rising from approximately $54,000 to peaks around $106,000 in December and January. If the market were to follow a similar trajectory from the current price level, a comparable 96% rally would see Bitcoin rise to a new peak near $212,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,000.

2025-05-29T01:56:37.000Z,"Nvidia posts mixed Q1, predicts $8B hit with US chip curbs","Chip-making giant Nvidia has posted mixed results in its first quarter earnings, beating Wall Street expectations on revenue but missing predictions on its income amid US restrictions on its exports to China. In earnings released May 28 for its first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year ended April 27, Nvidia reported revenues of $44.1 billion, up 12% from its previous quarter and 69% from a year ago and beating Zacks analyst estimates of $42.91 billion by nearly 2.7%. However, the chip maker posted an earnings per share of 81 cents, missing analyst estimates of 85 cents per share. Nvidia recorded a net income of $18.8 billion, up 26% compared to a year ago. In an earnings call, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said that the “global demand for Nvidia’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong” as countries start recognizing “AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet.” Source: Nvidia “AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate,” he said. US export rules to deliver $8 billion hit Nvidia said the lower-than-expected income resulted from a $4.5 billion charge due to the US government’s restrictions on exporting its high-powered H20 artificial intelligence chips to China. In its outlook for its Q2 results, the company said it expects revenues around $45 billion, which “reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations.” Nvidia will reportedly launch a new lower-cost AI chip specifically for China, with mass production expected to start in June. Nvidia’s data center revenue accounted for most of the firm’s total revenues, hitting $39.1 billion, up 10% from the previous quarter. Related: El Salvador works with Nvidia to develop sovereign AI infrastructure Shares in Nvidia Corp (NVDA) closed trading on May 28 down 0.51% at $134.81 but rallied 4.89% after the bell on its results to $141.40, according to Google Finance. Nvidia Corp shares jumped nearly 5% after trading following its financial results release. Source: Google Finance Huang has previously said his firm is focused on being at the forefront of agentic AI as the race around the tech heats up. Other US firms have also begun ramping up AI expansion . Microsoft said in September that it was establishing two AI centers in Abu Dhabi . At the same time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining companies have been diversifying their income streams to include AI , converting some of their crypto mining operations to help run compute-intensive large language models.

2025-05-29T01:56:03.000Z,"Eric Trump and Don Jr. predict $170k Bitcoin by 2026","Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, sons of former President Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin could surpass $170,000 by 2026. They shared this bullish outlook during a discussion on stage at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Don Jr. anticipated that Bitcoin could trade from $175,000 to $150,000 after Eric joked that the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market value could soar “to the moon” by the close of next year . Eric said that every day, people put billions and billions of dollars into Bitcoin. He forecasted that 0.1 Bitcoin would be worth an absolute fortune, adding that demand for the digital asset overtook supply. Saylor urges Trump’s family to invest in Bitcoin Don Jr. and Eric have become strong supporters of the crypto industry . They are involved in various crypto projects, such as the World Liberty Financial DeFi project and an American Bitcoin mining company. Moreover, most recently, Nasdaq-listed Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind Truth Social and Truth. Fi revealed its plans to raise $2.5 billion to launch a Bitcoin treasury. American Bitcoin is also “staking sats” as part of a plan to boost its “Bitcoin per share” metric, which it uses to calculate the value of Bitcoin treasury companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Meanwhile, World Liberty intends to introduce a stablecoin. Don Jr. stated that they are actively working on all these projects, bearing in mind that crypto is for the long term. He further stated that this was a major focus for them. Eric revealed that Saylor was helping the Trump family transition into “crypto magnates.” At one point, Saylor had tried to convince the Trumps — with whom he has been family friends in New York for a long time — to mortgage the Mar-a-Lago property so they could use the money to buy Bitcoin. Eric mentioned that Saylor told them to follow his lead, urging them that there was an amazing chance of getting Bitcoin. He then admitted that he had never seen anything like this in any other field where a major leader is actually encouraging talented individuals to challenge them. Bitcoin reached a greater height on May 22, closing at $111,390 after briefly rising to a high of $112,000. The milestone capped a 45% surge in early April when Bitcoin was traded at around $76,450. Based on CoinMarketCap reports, Bitcoin is trading at $108,105.47, reflecting an approximately 1% decrease in the past 24 hours. Eric says everyone wants to be associated with Bitcoin Eric observed in his daily experiences with the Trump organization that he is seeing more institutions create strategies for holding Bitcoin, including royal families and private offices. He mentioned that just a year ago, fewer than 100 companies were likely treasuring Bitcoin, and now this has changed. Following this, he stated that this trend is not limited to America. It includes the entire Middle East, Africa, and all of Asia. Based on his argument, everyone wants to be associated with Bitcoin and not to part with it. Eric further highlighted that his interest in cryptocurrency was strengthen after he experienced some difficulties with the traditional financial system, including the process of being debanked. “All of my accounts just stopped working,” he said. “Then you start to see how corrupt the system is… it was used to be against people.” “I don’t like using the word hate, but I can’t think of a better word,” he added, before admitting that he would like to see some of the big banks vanish entirely, because, in his opinion, they really ought to.

2025-05-29T01:30:43.000Z,"Circle IPO: BlackRock Makes Strategic Cryptocurrency Investment Move","BitcoinWorld Circle IPO: BlackRock Makes Strategic Cryptocurrency Investment Move Hey everyone, got some potentially huge news coming out of the finance and crypto worlds! The word is that BlackRock , the absolute giant in asset management (we’re talking trillions under management here), is eyeing a significant stake in the upcoming Circle IPO . This isn’t just any company; we’re talking about Circle Internet Financial, the issuer behind the widely used USDC stablecoin. What’s Happening with the Circle IPO ? According to reports, citing a Bloomberg story via Unfolded, BlackRock plans to snap up a substantial 10% chunk of the shares Circle intends to issue during its initial public offering on the U.S. stock market. This is a major signal from traditional finance towards the digital asset space. Here are some key details being reported about the IPO: Issuer: Circle Internet Financial (known for the USDC stablecoin) Planned BlackRock Stake: 10% of shares issued Expected Price Range: Between $24 and $26 per share Fundraising Target: Approximately $624 million Market: U.S. Stock Market This move highlights the growing intersection between Wall Street and the crypto economy, particularly focusing on regulated entities like Circle. BlackRock ‘s Increasing Presence in Crypto This isn’t BlackRock’s first foray into the crypto space, but it’s certainly one of the most direct endorsements of a crypto-native company’s public offering. BlackRock has been increasingly active, notably launching a highly successful spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) earlier this year. Their interest in Circle and USDC demonstrates a broader strategy to engage with various facets of the digital asset ecosystem beyond just Bitcoin. For a firm of BlackRock’s size and influence, a 10% stake isn’t just a passive investment; it could signal a strategic partnership or a deep belief in Circle’s business model and the future of stablecoins. It positions BlackRock even more firmly as a key player in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment . The Significance of USDC and the Stablecoin Market Circle’s primary product is USDC , one of the largest and most regulated stablecoins globally. Stablecoins are crucial bridges between traditional fiat currency and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. They are used for trading, lending, payments, and as a safe haven within the crypto market. BlackRock’s investment interest validates not only Circle as a company but also the critical role that regulated stablecoins like USDC play in the financial system. It suggests that major traditional finance players see stablecoins as a legitimate and necessary infrastructure for future financial transactions and cryptocurrency investment strategies. Consider the implications: Validation: A stamp of approval from the world’s largest asset manager. Liquidity & Stability: Potentially increases confidence and usage of USDC . Regulatory Confidence: Suggests BlackRock is comfortable with Circle’s approach to regulation. Bridging TradFi & DeFi: Further connects traditional finance with decentralized finance applications that heavily rely on stablecoins. Why This Cryptocurrency Investment Matters A cryptocurrency investment of this magnitude from a firm like BlackRock into a company like Circle during its IPO is a landmark event. It signifies the continued maturation of the crypto market and its integration into the global financial system. It’s not just about the money being raised; it’s about the trust and legitimacy being conferred by one of the most respected names in finance. This could pave the way for other major institutions to look at direct investments in crypto infrastructure companies, not just the assets themselves. It underscores a broader trend: digital assets, including stablecoins, are becoming an undeniable part of the financial future, attracting serious capital from the traditional world. Looking Ahead: Implications for TradFi and Crypto The potential BlackRock investment in the Circle IPO has ripple effects. For Circle, it could mean a highly successful IPO, increased visibility, and potentially future collaborations with BlackRock. For BlackRock, it deepens their footprint in the digital asset space and positions them strategically in the stablecoin market. For the broader crypto market, it’s a vote of confidence that could attract more institutional interest and capital. It reinforces the narrative that regulated and compliant crypto companies are appealing investment opportunities for even the most conservative financial players. While this is still a plan and subject to the IPO’s successful execution, the intention itself speaks volumes about where the smart money sees future growth. In Conclusion BlackRock’s reported plan to acquire 10% of Circle’s IPO shares is a monumental development. It’s a powerful signal of institutional confidence in Circle, USDC , and the stablecoin market as a whole. This strategic cryptocurrency investment from the world’s largest asset manager further blurs the lines between traditional finance and the digital asset space, highlighting the increasing mainstream acceptance and integration of crypto infrastructure.

2025-05-29T01:20:16.000Z,"Momentum: JD Vance Predicts 100M Bitcoin Holders, Champions Pro-Crypto Policy","BitcoinWorld Momentum: JD Vance Predicts 100M Bitcoin Holders, Champions Pro-Crypto Policy The world of cryptocurrency is constantly buzzing with predictions and political discourse, and a recent appearance by JD Vance , the U.S. Vice President, at the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas certainly added fuel to the fire. Vance didn’t mince words, offering a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and a clear stance on the future of crypto policy in the United States. Why Does JD Vance See Crypto as a “Ground-Up Innovation”? Speaking before a crowd of crypto enthusiasts and industry leaders, JD Vance characterized cryptocurrency, and particularly Bitcoin , as a genuine “ground-up innovation.” This framing is significant as it positions digital assets not as a fringe financial tool or a speculative bubble, but as a fundamental technological advancement driven by individuals and market forces rather than top-down governmental mandates. His remarks at Bitcoin 2025 highlighted: Decentralized Nature: Emphasizing that the technology and adoption are growing organically from users and developers. Economic Empowerment: Suggesting it provides new avenues for financial participation outside traditional systems. Technological Progress: Recognizing the underlying blockchain technology as a significant leap forward. This perspective aligns with a view that sees crypto as an unstoppable force, one that policy should seek to understand and integrate rather than stifle. Vance’s embrace of this narrative signals a potential shift in how a future administration might approach the digital asset space, moving away from skepticism towards recognition of its innovative potential. Can We Really Expect 100 Million Bitcoin Holders Soon? Perhaps one of the most striking predictions from JD Vance was his forecast that 100 million people would soon own Bitcoin . While he didn’t provide a specific timeline or the data underpinning this prediction, it reflects a strong belief in the accelerating pace of global Bitcoin adoption. To put this number into perspective: Metric Current Estimate (Approx.) Vance’s Prediction Global Crypto Owners ~500-600 million N/A (Prediction specific to BTC) Global Bitcoin Holders ~200-300 million An additional 100 million soon % of World Population ~2.5% – 3.8% Potentially pushing towards 5% Reaching 100 million new holders would represent a substantial increase, suggesting Vance foresees a significant acceleration in mainstream adoption. This could be driven by various factors, including increased institutional interest, clearer regulatory frameworks (which he advocated for), growing awareness, and potentially macroeconomic conditions pushing people towards alternative assets like Bitcoin . Is Crypto the Ultimate Hedge Against Inflation and Government Overreach? A core tenet of Vance’s argument for Bitcoin and crypto is their perceived role as a hedge. He explicitly mentioned hedging against both inflation and government overreach. This is a common theme among crypto proponents: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often contrasted with fiat currencies, which can be subject to inflationary pressures through quantitative easing and government spending. The narrative is that as traditional currencies potentially lose purchasing power, scarce assets like Bitcoin can retain or increase value. Government Overreach: The decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin , means they operate outside the direct control of any single government or central authority. This offers a potential hedge against excessive financial surveillance, censorship, or control over personal assets. Vance’s articulation of these points resonates deeply within the crypto community, highlighting the philosophical underpinnings that attract many to the space beyond just investment potential. It frames crypto not just as an asset class, but as a tool for financial sovereignty and protection. Why the Criticism of Regulators Like Gary Gensler? The current regulatory landscape in the United States has been a major point of contention for the crypto industry. JD Vance echoed these frustrations by criticizing regulators, specifically mentioning Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The criticism typically centers on: Regulation by Enforcement: The SEC has been accused of using enforcement actions against crypto companies rather than providing clear rules of the road beforehand. Lack of Clarity: The industry has long called for clear guidelines on how digital assets should be classified and regulated, which many argue has not been adequately provided. Jurisdictional Disputes: Uncertainty exists regarding which regulatory body (SEC, CFTC, etc.) has primary oversight over different aspects of the crypto market. Vance’s critique suggests that the current regulatory approach is hindering innovation and creating uncertainty, rather than fostering responsible growth. His comments imply a desire for a more predictable and perhaps less aggressive regulatory environment for the crypto sector. What Does Pledging Trump Administration Support Mean for US Crypto Regulation? A significant part of JD Vance’s speech focused on the potential policy direction under a future Trump administration. He pledged support for the industry, indicating a potential pivot from the current administration’s approach. This pledge included a commitment to ending policies perceived as hostile to crypto, most notably Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . Understanding the potential impact requires looking at what “support” might entail: Clearer Legislation: Pushing for congressional action to create a defined legal framework for digital assets. Industry Dialogue: Engaging with crypto businesses and experts to understand their needs and concerns. Appointments: Appointing regulators who may be more favorable or knowledgeable about the crypto space. Ending Restrictive Policies: Actively dismantling initiatives seen as targeting the crypto industry indirectly. This kind of high-level political backing, if materialized, could significantly de-risk the U.S. market for crypto businesses and investors, potentially attracting more capital and talent to the country. Dismantling Operation Chokepoint 2.0: A Key Policy Promise One specific policy target mentioned by JD Vance was the promise to end Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . This term, coined by the crypto community, refers to a perceived coordinated effort by regulators and financial institutions to limit or cut off banking services to legitimate crypto businesses. While not an official government program name, the effects described are real: Crypto companies facing difficulty opening or maintaining bank accounts. Increased scrutiny and pressure on banks that service crypto clients. Delays or denials of payments related to crypto transactions. The original ‘Operation Chokepoint’ from the Obama administration targeted businesses deemed high-risk (like payday lenders) by pressuring banks to cease doing business with them. ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ is seen as a similar tactic applied to the crypto sector. Ending such practices would be a major win for crypto businesses, providing them with essential access to the traditional financial system and fostering a more stable operating environment. What Are the Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community? JD Vance’s statements offer several key takeaways: Political Engagement Matters: The fact that high-profile politicians are speaking at crypto conferences and discussing specific policy changes underscores the growing political relevance of the industry. Policy Shift Potential: A potential change in administration could bring a significant shift in US crypto regulation , potentially favoring growth and clarity over enforcement. Continued Advocacy Needed: While promises are made, the industry must continue to advocate for clear, supportive, and innovation-friendly regulations. Adoption Narrative Strengthened: Predictions like 100 million Bitcoin holders reinforce the long-term growth narrative for the asset. For investors and businesses, these signals suggest paying close attention to the political landscape and advocating for policies that support responsible innovation rather than hinder it. Conclusion: A Glimpse into a Potentially Brighter Regulatory Future? JD Vance’s appearance at Bitcoin 2025 delivered a clear message: the potential future leadership views crypto not as a threat to be contained, but as an innovation to be fostered. His prediction of 100 million Bitcoin holders reflects a bullish long-term view, while his pointed criticism of current regulators and specific policy promises, like ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0 , signal a desire for a dramatic shift in US crypto regulation . While political promises are subject to the complexities of governance, Vance’s statements provide a glimpse of a potentially more supportive and predictable environment for the digital asset industry in the United States, offering hope to many within the community.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

K33 could purchase up to 57 Bitcoin (BTC) at BTC’s current price of just over $108,000. Source: K33K33 CEO Bull Jenssen posted to X on May 28 that he thinks Bitcoin will be the “best-performing asset in the coming decade,” and his company will “accumulate as many as possible while unlocking powerful operational synergies with our brokerage operation.”“Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build you own? Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028. The remaining 15 million Swedish krona ($1.5 million) will come through a new share issuance and warrants, according to K33. If investors convert their warrants before March 2026, they are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate. If fully exercised, K33 could raise up to 75 million Swedish krona ($7.7 million) for its Bitcoin buy. Bitcoin treasury part of expansion plans In K33’s interim report for the first quarter, released May 28, Jenssen said K33 is working with other Bitcoin treasury companies in the Nordics and hopes to use its treasury as a foundation to offer new services, such as BTC-backed lending. “For K33, Bitcoin is not only a high-conviction asset — it’s also a strategic enabler.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart.

The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling.

Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share. Ethereum no longer ranks among the top ten protocols in terms of fees, creating a supply imbalance that contributes to inflationary pressure on ETH.Sell (put) options ill-prepared for ETH prices above $2,600ETH options aggregate open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $2,300 and $2,500: $420 million in calls (buy) vs. $220 million in puts (sell).

2025-05-28T21:49:46.000Z,"Labor Department rescinds Biden-era guidance for crypto in 401(k) plans","The US Labor Department has officially rescinded guidance issued during the Biden administration that limited the inclusion of cryptocurrency in 401(k) retirement plans.On May 28, the Labor Department revoked a 2022 guidance that had urged fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” when considering cryptocurrency for 401(k) retirement plans. The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”“We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats,” said US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. The Labor Department under Biden criticized the practice of marketing cryptocurrencies to 401(k) participants. At the time, the agency claimed cryptocurrencies posed “significant risks and challenges” to participants’ retirement accounts due to their “speculative and volatile” nature and “valuation concerns,” among other reasons.The American Banking Association (ABA) criticized the 2022 compliance release, claiming that it did not make the guidance available for public comment and review prior to issuance.Related: Fidelity introduces retirement accounts with minimal-fee crypto investingTrump administration shifts crypto landscapePresident Trump has pledged to make the United States “the world capital of crypto” during his 2024 campaign.Under his administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has scaled back several enforcement actions and investigations involving Web3 companies such as Uniswap, Coinbase, and Kraken, while also engaging in policy discussions on topics like real-world asset tokenization and the regulatory status of certain tokens.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5.

This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved.

2025-05-28T13:33:33.000Z,"UK FCA requests public comments on stablecoin, crypto custody regulation","The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has requested public feedback on proposed regulations for stablecoins and cryptocurrency custody.In a May 28 request for comment, the United Kingdom’s financial regulator announced that its regulatory proposals are “the latest milestone on the road to crypto regulation.” The draft rules are based on prior roundtables and industry feedback. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets. At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.”The FCA also noted it will work with the UK’s central bank to regulate stablecoins. Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said, “For those stablecoins that expect to operate at systemic scale, the Bank of England will publish a complementary consultation paper later this year.”Related: UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini reportEnsuring stablecoins remain stableThe FCA said that its rules “aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value.” The regulator said customers must be clearly informed about how the backing assets are managed. It also recommended that stablecoin issuers appoint independent third-party custodians to hold reserve assets:“We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency, irrespective of the value of the backing assets portfolio, with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.“Breeden added that the FCA’s proposals are part of a broader effort to build the UK’s stablecoin regime.Related: UK to require crypto firms to report every customer transactionCrypto custody rules incomingThe FCA’s proposals also introduce new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services, as outlined in a separate discussion paper. The rules are designed to ensure that user assets are secure and can be accessed at any time:“The FCA's proposals would require firms providing crypto custody services, who have responsibility for keeping consumers’ crypto safe, to ensure they are effectively secured and can be easily accessed at any time.“Proposed measures also aim to reduce both the likelihood and impact of crypto firms failing, both in the crypto custody and stablecoin sectors.

2025-05-28T13:19:41.000Z,"NFT monthly sales break 2025 downward trend in May: CryptoSlam","Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) caught an uptick in monthly sales in May after months of consistent decline throughout 2025. Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT monthly sales. Source: CointelegraphNFT sellers dwindle, while buyers increaseMay also showed a significant jump in unique buyers. The number of users buying NFTs rose by 50% to over 936,000 in May, up from around 622,000 in April.May’s figures are the largest buyer count since October 2024, hinting at growing investor participation during the month. While buyers increased, the number of unique sellers continued to decline. In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers.

The analyst believes real-world assets (RWAs) linking with NFTs could reignite the lending sector of digital collectibles. RWA NFTs also showed potential earlier this year.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech.

My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not.

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point. This projects a target range of $3,100–$3,200, aligning with prior resistance levels around $3,100 and $3,400.Ethereum 1-day chart.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order.
