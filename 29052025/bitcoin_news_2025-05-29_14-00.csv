2025-05-29T11:52:45.000Z,"Bitcoin Enters Euphoria Phase: On-Chain Data Signals Volatility Ahead at $120K","Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a new phase of the bull cycle, hitting an all-time high (ATH) north of $111,000 on May 22, which was fueled by increased investor confidence, record spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, and heightened derivatives activity. However, as on-chain indicators flash signs of euphoric sentiment, analysts are warning that volatility could be around the corner, especially with the $120,000 level emerging as an important psychological and technical threshold. Rising Activity, Rising Caution According to the latest weekly market sweep by crypto analytics platform Glassnode, Bitcoin’s strength remains firmly intact. Metrics show rising investor profitability, soaring trade volume through centralized exchanges, and a 51% increase in futures open interest since April’s local low around the $74,000 level. The euphoric signals are also manifesting in tangible market activity. Glassnode reported a significant uptick in exchange interactions, with approximately 33% of all Bitcoin on-chain volume now flowing through centralized trading venues, something analysts consider to be a clear indicator of rising trading appetite. Furthermore, the analytics platform noted that while BTC has broken its third ATH this cycle, the rally remains within historical bounds. Its data paints a picture of a market heating up rapidly, with investor profitability surging high enough to push the Relative Unrealized Profit metric above its +2 standard deviation band. “These environments are usually characterized by heightened volatility and tend to be brief in duration,” noted analysts, highlighting that only 16% of all trading days see such extreme paper profits. Their finding is similar to a May 28 report from CryptoQuant, which revealed that 99% of Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are now in profit . This threshold marked critical market turning points in the past, often coming before either sustained rallies or sharp corrections. However, the experts at CryptoQuant urged caution, pointing to unresolved macroeconomic uncertainties , particularly around U.S. policy direction under the Trump administration, as a factor that could potentially mute full-blown risk appetite despite the extreme profitability. Price Action Reflects the Tension BTC’s recent price trajectory seems to be reflecting this push-and-pull dynamic. After peaking at $111,814 a week ago, the flagship cryptocurrency has experienced expected consolidation, pulling back to trade around $107,728 at the time of this writing. While the price represents a modest 1.2% dip in the last 24 hours, zooming out reveals the broader momentum. Despite a 3.4% pullback over the past seven days, BTC remains up by a solid 14.1% over the last month, while its year-over-year gains stand at 56.6%. All eyes are now fixed on the $120,000 threshold, which Glassnode identified as a critical inflection point at which several on-chain price models converge. Judging from the past, if BTC were to breach these levels, it could accelerate sell-side pressure as long-term holders look to pocket gains. “In the event of further upside, the $120k level appears as a key zone of interest, with sell-side pressure expected to accelerate,” the platform’s analysts concluded.

2025-05-29T11:52:11.000Z,"Hyperliquid pulls back after parabolic rally, retesting key support zone","Hyperliquid is cooling off after a parabolic rally, with price pulling back from recent highs as traders watch key support levels. Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) is trading at $34.25 at press time, down 5% over the past 24 hours. This follows a strong rally that saw the token climb 83% over the last 30 days, peaking at a new all-time high of $39.58 on May 26. Despite the dip, trading activity remains high. In the last 24 hours, trading volume rose to $325.7 million, a 12% increase in the past day. Derivatives activity has also been sustained, with a daily volume of $1.27 billion, up 8.33%, according to Coinglass data . Following the recent price peak, HYPE’s open interest dropped 4.45% to $1.29 billion, indicating that some traders might be taking profits or reducing leverage. The recent market move comes after Hyperliquid’s decentralized perpetuals platform saw a record spike in on-chain metrics. For the week ending May 26, the decentralized exchange recorded the highest weekly trading volume of $72 billion and an all-time high in open interest at $10.1 billion. Hyperliquid also surpassed major decentralized finance platforms like Berachain ( BERA ) in total value locked, reaching $3.5 billion, and now nears $1.5 trillion in cumulative trading volume less than two years after launch. You might also like: No VC, $1B Trades, and a 300% Rally — what makes Hyperliquid crypto tick? Part of the platform’s recent spotlight stems from visible high-leverage whale activity. Notably, pseudonymous trader James Wynn opened a $1.25 billion long position on Bitcoin ( BTC ) using 40x leverage between May 21–22. Initially, the trade netted in unrealized gains of $40 million, but by May 25, a market decline brought on by Trump’s tariff announcement resulted in losses ranging from $13.4 million to $17.5 million. Looking at the technical picture, HYPE appears to be in a healthy consolidation phase. After retreating from the upper Bollinger Band at $39, the token is currently testing the middle band, which is in line with short-term moving averages, around $33. Hyperliquid price analysis. Credit: crypto.news At 65.5, the relative strength index is showing positive momentum despite declining from overbought levels. The moving average convergence divergence is still bullish and indicates a sustained upward bias. All major moving averages, including the 10-day, 100-day, and SMAs, are in strong buy territory. The Stochastic RSI, on the other hand, is cooling, indicating that the rally may be losing steam. Bulls may view this as a buying opportunity if the token remains above the 20-day EMA at about $30.4. A drop below this could lead to a retest of lower levels near $28. On the upside, a break above $36 might pave the way for a second push toward $40 and higher highs.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Sherpa tells his 246,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is primed to rally if it overcomes a key psychological level. “Quite simple: if BTC breaks $110,000, we’re going to send pretty hard. Until then, altcoins probably just chop and slightly bleed down.” Source: AltcoinSherpa/X Bitcoin is trading at $108,819 at time of writing, a level that’s less than 3% below the all-time high price of just under $112,000 reached on May 22nd. The analyst also says Bitcoin’s price action over the coming few months will determine Ethereum’s trajectory. According to Sherpa, ETH could go up by around 50% over the coming months and about 280% in the long run. “The funny thing about this is that ETH probably still is going to go to $10,000 even with ETH/BTC being down only. Don’t know what happens in the short/mid-term but $4,000 should come within the next few months as long as Bitcoin holds up.” Source: AltcoinSherpa/X Ethereum is trading at $2,643 at time of writing. The widely followed analyst and trader also says Solana ( SOL ) appears bullish on the daily time frame, but its trajectory is dependent on Bitcoin’s price action. “Solana chart still looks pretty solid overall for a higher time frame swing. All daily exponential moving averages (EMAs) lined up, Bitcoin still okay, etc.” Source: AltcoinSherpa/X Solana is trading at $174 at time of writing.

2025-05-29T11:41:06.000Z,"Elon Musk Steps Down as Government Efficiency Czar After Short-Lived Tenure","Elon Musk has officially stepped down from his role as the White House’s government cost-cutting czar, ending a brief and contentious stint at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Confirming the news via a May 29 post on X, Musk thanked President Donald Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending” but admitted that improving federal operations proved to be an “uphill battle.” Musk’s position as a Special Government Employee limited his tenure to a maximum of 130 working days, which officially concludes on May 30. Appointed earlier this year, Musk took on the challenge of streamlining federal programs and reducing the size of the government workforce, but the results fell far short of his original ambition to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget. Musk Ambitious Targets According to Musk and DOGE, the department claims to have saved U.S. taxpayers around $175 billion since Trump’s return to office in January. However, multiple media outlets and independent audits have disputed these figures, citing errors and exaggerations. Even by Musk’s own revised goal of $150 billion, the claimed savings still fall just short. The agency reportedly eliminated approximately 260,000 federal positions — about 12% of the total 2.3 million workforce — through layoffs, buyouts, and early retirements . These moves drew backlash from labor unions and public sector advocates. A federal lawsuit filed by 14 states accuses DOGE of overstepping legal boundaries, including unauthorized access to data and the unlawful termination of federal employees. Musk also criticized a recent multi-trillion-dollar tax break package passed by House Republicans, arguing that it undermines DOGE’s budget reduction efforts. “The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I expected,” he told The Washington Post , and acknowledged the difficulty of achieving meaningful reform within Washington. Balancing Government Work and Corporate Leadership In a separate interview with Ars Technica on May 28, Musk reflected on the time he devoted to political affairs, stating, “I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics.” Critics have pointed to the executive’s increasing political involvement as a factor in Tesla’s recent struggles, including an 80% drop in net income in Q1. Still, Musk maintains that his role in DOGE was overstated and that his focus is now shifting back to his companies. “It’s not like I left the companies,” he clarified. Following his earlier announcement to reduce political commitments, Tesla shares jumped over 5% in after-hours trading, signaling renewed investor confidence. Despite Tesla’s underwhelming financial performance in 2025, the company still holds 11,509 Bitcoin , worth approximately $1.24 billion. Tesla stock remains down 5.9% year-to-date, largely in line with broader tech market trends.

2025-05-29T11:35:30.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – May 29, 2025","The crypto market saw another small drop today, though the situation has improved compared to yesterday, with more coins in the green, as the market consolidates. Nearly half of the top 100 coins per market cap have increased over the past day. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 2%, currently standing at $3.55 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $122 billion. TLDR: Crypto market consolidates; BTC hovers around the $108,000 level; Short-term sell-offs are expected; Bitcoin’s robust performance is a “fascinating signal amidst relatively challenging market conditions”; US spot ETFs continue seeing significant inflows; The dip is a part of the historical pattern, but keep an eye on the surrounding events. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, four of the top 10 coins per market capitalization are down and four are up over the past day (not taking stablecoins into account). Bitcoin (BTC) has decreased by 0.9% to the price of $107,940. This is also down from the intraday high of $109.037. Ethereum (ETH) saw the highest increase in this category by far. While others are up less than 1% per coin, ETH appreciated 3.6% to $2,729. As for ten coins, they are all down by less than 1%. BTC’s and Solana (SOL)’s 0.9% falls are the highest. SOL now trades at $172. Of the top 100 coins, nearly half are green, more than double seen yesterday. The highest decrease is Fartcoin (FARTCOIN)’s 4.8% to $1.29. The highest gainer is SPX6900 (SPX) , followed by Toncoin (TON) . They’re up 14.3% and 11% to $1.13 and $3.31, respectively. Over the past 24, TON perpetual futures open interest jumped to $190 million, its highest level since February. Over the past 24h, $TON perpetual futures OI surged +33% from $143M to $190M – its highest level since Feb 18. Interestingly, OI stayed elevated even after the price pullback. Past spikes like this have often preceded corrections – worth watching closely: https://t.co/wXpcaQoKul pic.twitter.com/IwbflHdkwZ — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 The current market dip doesn’t seem alarming. Per various analysts, it’s following the previously established patterns, whereby rallies are followed by short-term downwards corrections and sell-offs. Overall, it’s currently consolidating. ‘The Broader Outlook Remarkably Uncertain’ “Strength in the Bitcoin market remains firm,” says the latest report by blockchain and market data intelligence platform Glassnode . The report notes that price discovery phases are historically often followed by brief sell-offs. Early profit-takers are exiting and de-risking at new highs. As the market re-enters a period of price discovery, the unrealized profit has surged. However, with the rise in profitability comes an increase in sell-side pressure. At the same time, when the price rises, “larger volumes of buy-side demand are required to absorb the distributed coins in order for the market to sustain upwards momentum,” Glassnode explains. Source: Glassnode Overall, BTC Bitcoin has followed the pattern so far. It hit an ATH, profit-takers seized the opportunity to exit, the price pulled back to $107,000 shortly after the initial breakout, then recovered and consolidated around the $108,000 level. “Bitcoin is outperforming most asset classes amidst an environment of challenging macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions, making the broader outlook remarkably uncertain. This robust performance is a truly fascinating signal amidst relatively challenging market conditions,” the report highlights. Is $BTC strength waning – or just heating up? In the latest Week On-Chain, we explore rising investor spending, #BTC volume flowing through exchanges, and surging derivatives activity. We also highlight $120K as the next key zone of interest. Learn why: https://t.co/S4doFto7uL pic.twitter.com/Qd86YbmVtC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 28, 2025 When the analysts compared the price performances of the current cycle to previous ones, they found “a surprising similarity in structure.” Glassnode argues that it’s “a remarkable feat” for BTC to track earlier cycles so closely when accounting for the significantly larger market capitalization today. “This suggests that the scale of demand for Bitcoin is keeping pace with the growth rate of the asset,” the report concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next As noted, BTC currently trades at $107,940. This is 3.5% lower than the all-time high of $111,814 hit a week ago. The coin has largely been trading around the $108,000 level over the last few hours. Notably, it broke one support level of $108,731. Should it go lower, we could see it breaking supports at the $107,000 and $105,000 levels as well. On the upside, we’re also looking to see if the coin will break through $109,600 again and push towards $112,000. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has decreased from 68 to 65 . Notably, this is also down from 76 seen last week. This is still the green territory and indicates positive market sentiment and increased risk-taking. Nonetheless, the decrease over the week is notable. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, on 28 May, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net inflow of $432.62 million , led by BlackRock’s $480.96 million. The total net inflow now reached $45.34 billion. US ETH spot ETFs saw $84.89 million in net inflows, significantly higher than yesterday. The cumulative inflow is now $2.88 billion. The flows haven’t turned negative despite the market decrease. This indicates continual and strong institutional support and adoption. Consequently, this support may fuel the market’s next leg up.

Norwegian crypto brokerage K33 raised $6.2 million through zero-interest loans and equity to fund Bitcoin purchases. Also, American video game retailer GameStop acquired 4,710 BTC . In Russia, the central bank allowed limited access to crypto-linked financial products for qualified investors. In the US, NYC Mayor Eric Adams has announced plans to build a municipal Bitcoin-backed bond , dubbed ‘BitBond’, and eliminate BitLicense.

BREAKING: NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS JUST ANNOUNCED HE'S GOING \""TO FIGHT TO GET A BITBOND IN NEW YORK\"" THIS IS MASSIVE pic.twitter.com/8Ix0spHEOf — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? The crypto market has recorded another slight decrease today, though the situation has improved since yesterday. The stock market also saw a decrease, though the two don’t seem linked. The S&P 500 is down 0.56%, the Nasdaq-100 fell 0.45%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 0.58%. Donald Trump’s back-and-forth on trade policy has resulted in volatile trading in traditional markets over the past few months. Is this dip sustainable? Analysts seem to agree that the rally may continue after a brief pause. Though the crypto market remains supported by strong capitalization and investor interest, regulatory or macroeconomic changes may negatively affect it as well, pulling the prices downward.

Nhiều đề xuất ETF tiền điện tử khác cũng đang được xem xét, cho thấy quan điểm quản lý có thể đang thay đổi. Các ngân hàng lớn của Mỹ như JP Morgan, Bank of America và Citigroup được cho là đang thảo luận sơ bộ về việc phát hành một stablecoin chung. Quốc hội Hoa Kỳ đang thúc đẩy dự luật liên quan đến stablecoin, đặc biệt là Đạo luật GENIUS nhằm thiết lập khung pháp lý rõ ràng. Những bước tiến này cho thấy sự quan tâm ngày càng tăng của các tổ chức tài chính và môi trường pháp lý đang trưởng thành hơn cho tài sản kỹ thuật số. Với các nhà đầu tư, điều này có thể mở ra nhiều cơ hội mới trên thị trường altcoin. Chỉ số “Tham lam” đang ở mức 76 và tổng vốn hóa thị trường đang tăng — đây là dấu hiệu rõ ràng của tâm lý “chấp nhận rủi ro”. Đặc biệt đáng chú ý là sự tăng trưởng của các altcoin như $MIND of Pepe, đã huy động được hơn 10 triệu USD trong vòng presale. Hãy cùng khám phá một số đồng altcoin tiềm năng nhất có thể tăng giá trong bối cảnh thị trường đầy hứa hẹn này. 1.

Cơ hội để tham gia sớm đang nhanh chóng khép lại khi đợt presale kết thúc chỉ sau hơn một tuần nữa. Chúng tôi dự đoán $MIND có thể đạt $0,00535 (tăng 72,52% từ mức giá ban đầu) vào cuối năm 2025 — và điều này càng khả thi hơn khi môi trường pháp lý đang dần thuận lợi, góp phần tăng niềm tin vào thị trường. MIND of Pepe hướng đến mục tiêu dân chủ hóa alpha, bằng cách kết hợp sức mạnh viral của Pepe với khả năng phân tích sâu của trí tuệ nhân tạo. Đã đến lúc đầu tư thông minh hơn, không chỉ chăm chỉ hơn. 2. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – Sức mạnh Pudgy.

Đây là thời đại mới của sự tự chủ đích thực dành cho người sáng tạo – với $SUBBD. Điểm bùng nổ mới của crypto – Đầu tư bằng sự thấu hiểu Khi ngành công nghiệp crypto ngày càng trưởng thành và được chào đón rộng rãi hơn, điều đó mở đường cho sự đổi mới và cơ hội đầu tư.

That expensive, complicated BitLicense has kept many firms at arm’s length – some even fled the state because of it. But now, Mayor Eric Adams is shaking things up in a big way. At Bitcoin 2025, he called for the full repeal of the BitLicense and invited crypto companies to “come back home.” What’s behind this sudden surge of confidence from a city that many thought had written off crypto? And what exactly is this new Bitcoin Bond he mentioned? Let’s break down what Adams’ vision is. Why BitLicense Has Been a Major Roadblock Since 2015, the BitLicense has been the golden ticket for crypto firms wanting to operate in New York. But “golden” is a stretch. The cost to get started easily tops $100,000, and the hoops to jump through are anything but easy. Only 34 companies have secured this license, including heavy hitters like Coinbase and Robinhood Crypto. For many, though, the price and red tape were too much. Some businesses, like BitQuick, left the state altogether, blaming “fee and compliance costs” for making New York more trouble than it’s worth. Adams: The “Bitcoin Mayor” Mayor Adams has been called the “Bitcoin mayor” for a reason – in 2022, he converted his first mayoral paycheck into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, he’s pushing harder, saying, “New York is the Empire State. We don’t break empires. We build empires.” He wants to scrap the BitLicense and open the doors wide for the “free flow of Bitcoin in our city.” That’s a clear challenge to the status quo. What’s This New York City Bitcoin Bond? Alongside the BitLicense repeal, Adams hinted at a fresh idea: a New York City Bitcoin Bond. The details are vague, but it could mean a municipal bond backed by Bitcoin – potentially giving everyday New Yorkers tax-exempt access to Bitcoin gains. It’s a smart move if it pans out, blending traditional finance with the crypto world in a way New York hasn’t seen before. Could This Be NYC’s Crypto Comeback Moment? If Adams pulls this off, New York could stop being a no-go zone for crypto startups. It might even spark a new wave of deregulation in other states hungry to attract digital asset firms. But the big question remains: Will the state government actually repeal the BitLicense? Or will this remain a dream, leaving crypto companies excluded?",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/mayor-eric-adams-demands-bitlicense-scrap-as-nyc-attracts-crypto-firms-come-back-home/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T11:27:29.000Z,"Bitcoin Is Not 'Rat Poison', But The Solution","Summary Bitcoin has proven itself as a store of value, diversification tool, and monetary hedge, especially in today's macro environment. Recent price action shows Bitcoin outperforming stocks even amid higher yields, signaling a fundamental shift in its market behavior. With US debt at unsustainable levels, monetary inflation is likely, making Bitcoin an essential hedge against fiscal irresponsibility. I remain highly bullish and advise investors to accumulate Bitcoin as a long-term hold for protection and growth. Thesis Summary Crypto was referred to as “rat poison” by Warren Buffett years ago, a sentiment which was recently echoed by a JPMorgan ( JPM ) employee. The timing could not be more ironic, with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) breaking new all-time highs and outperforming stocks even in a regime of higher yields. Far from rat poison, Bitcoin has provided investors with much-needed diversification from US financial assets and US currency exposure. Bitcoin, especially in the last few months, has proven itself as a monetary hedge, and with the macro regime we are facing, it’s never made more sense to own Bitcoin than today. I continue to advise investors to accumulate Bitcoin as a long-term hold. Interesting Timing Last week, President Trump was quoted on Twitter saying that the US is leading China in crypto. As a response to this, a former JPM employee, Marko Kolanovic , echoed Buffett's infamous words and tweeted that we are leading China in distributing rat poison . Curiously enough, less than a week later, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon announced the bank would be facilitating Bitcoin buying for its clients. While there are certainly some arguments to be made against the broader crypto space, I think we are well past the point of calling Bitcoin itself rat poison. Since its launch over 10 years ago, Bitcoin has proven itself as a store of value, a valuable diversification tool, and more recently, an actual hedge against monetary inflation and fiscal irresponsibility. What is Bitcoin? As an asset that is costly to create and has a limited supply, it is a store of value. (Not to be confused with price). A Bitcoin has some intrinsic value, and this will never be eroded through big changes in the supply. But where does Bitcoin demand come from? A few years ago, it was a niche subsector of the population: anarchists, libertarians, gold bugs, and tech enthusiasts. Then it became retail investors, who started to buy through exchanges. Shortly after, companies joined the game, followed by financial institutions and even sovereign nations. Does over 10 years of this trend not validate the demand side of the equation? Liquidity Barometer As a more “speculative” asset, Bitcoin’s prices have fluctuated with changes in global liquidity. Bitcoin/Liquidity (X) Global liquidity can be broadly understood as the amount of currency chasing assets around the world. More currency generally translates into higher asset prices, although not necessarily inflation. This is why stocks saw a big rise after COVID and also why Bitcoin rallied. Bitcoin: Now More Than Ever However, something even more interesting has happened in the last few months. Firstly, Bitcoin has outperformed other “risk assets” in the last six months. Even through geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin is making new highs while the SPX hasn’t yet. BTC vs SPX (TradingView) More importantly, Bitcoin has managed to rise in what we could even call a context of tightening liquidity/financial conditions, as measured by the 10-year yield in US Treasuries. BTC vs Yields (TradingView) Traditionally, the formula was yields down, Bitcoin up. However, in the last six months, we have seen yields up and Bitcoin up. This could suggest there is a fundamental shift in the Bitcoin market, which may be moving much more in line with, for example, gold, another monetary hedge. Trump Has Already Failed Therefore, we can highlight two very important developments in Bitcoin over the last three months. Bitcoin is outperforming traditional assets and moving higher with yields. It has become a hedge. Bitcoin and other assets are signalling that Trump has already failed in his policies. While President Trump came in with seemingly good intentions, a lot of his actions have fallen short of expectations. Tariffs have not been implemented yet. DOGE has barely made a dent in the budget. With aggressive tax cuts planned, the budget deficit could further increase in the next decade. In short, the \""status quo\"" looks ready to remain in place, with higher spending, and the US dollar continuing to hold its place as a reserve currency. This is going to require a much weaker dollar, something we have seen, and much higher inflation. Even the most \""radical\"" President in over two decades lacks either the will, support, or conviction to change things meaningfully. Bitcoin Is Inevitable Out of all the charts shown today, none is as important and explains what’s happening with Bitcoin as the one below. US Debt-GDP, Inflation, Yields (FRED) The US debt-to-GDP ratio is at wartime levels. It is definitely unsustainable, and the most likely outcome now is that we will reduce this debt burden through monetary inflation. This means money printing, yield curve control, and even possibly capital controls/financial repression. All things that happened in the 1960s and 1970s, and led to high inflation and high yields. However, it did successfully serve to bring down the debt-GDP levels. A win for the US government. A win for savvy investors. But a big loss for currency holders. The world is waking up to this reality again, but this time, the tools to hedge are much more widely available and accessible. Risks The real risk to Bitcoin would be a situation where the world actually makes a coordinated effort to reduce deficits through lower spending while simultaneously making some kind of return to hard money. By hard money, I mean a policy in which fiat currencies maintain a stable price in terms of gold. But even in this case, the hyper-financialised economic system we live in would have to be dialed back, and while Bitcoin would suffer, it could still prove more resilient than other financial assets. Beyond that, I'd argue the only other risk to Bitcoin is developments in quantum computing that could make Bitcoin vulnerable. As of writing this, I'd argue Bitcoin is even more secure than string gold in a vault, but this could actually change one day. Final Thoughts All in all, I remain very bullish on Bitcoin. It is perhaps one of the assets you can buy today with the highest conviction, in my opinion. Much more than a speculative risk asset, Bitcoin is now officially a hedge against fiscal irresponsibility and a debt crisis.

2025-05-29T11:21:42.000Z,"Dollar rallies, crypto unmoved as courts deal setbacks to Trump’s tariffs","Crypto markets stayed quiet on Thursday, even as the U.S. dollar pushed higher following a court ruling that temporarily blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping import tariffs on American trading partners. The decision, which came from a federal trade court, stated that Trump overstepped his legal authority in slapping across-the-board duties—throwing a wrench in the White House’s protectionist playbook. Trump’s team immediately filed an appeal , but the momentary pause in trade aggression gave the greenback enough oxygen to rally modestly across the board, including gains against the yen and the Swiss franc. According to data from Reuters , the dollar rose 0.34% against both currencies and briefly hit a two-week high of 146.29 yen before easing slightly. It also moved up against the euro, now trading near $1.1276, while sterling weakened to around $1.3467. Source: TradingView All these brought the U.S. dollar index—which tracks the dollar against six major currencies—back above 100 for the first time in a week. Still, it’s down 8% year-to-date, and most analysts aren’t sold on the idea of a sustained rally, warning that a lengthy legal battle over tariffs could keep the market jittery. Trump’s tariff loss boosts dollar and other currencies The Trump administration’s trade unpredictability has been a consistent drag on U.S. assets this year, as investors grow more cautious about high government debt and inconsistent economic direction. That change in risk appetite is showing up in Asian markets. As Trump’s trade tensions with China start to ease, investors are beginning to pull funds from U.S. assets and stack positions in Asian currencies. A new Reuters poll showed rising bullish sentiment for the yuan, Taiwanese dollar, and Philippine peso, all hitting levels not seen since late 2020. The Chinese yuan, which is now at its highest long position since October 2024, climbed 1% this month, partly due to revived trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Meanwhile, leaders across Southeast Asia have agreed that any bilateral trade agreements with the U.S. should not damage other member economies, a clear sign that Asia’s collective pushback to Trump’s tactics is gaining traction. The Taiwanese dollar, for example, has already surged more than 6% in May, logging its strongest monthly performance ever. Taiwan’s president dismissed talk of any currency agreement with Washington, pushing back on rumors that spiked the dollar on speculation that Trump was influencing its value. Bitcoin holds steady despite volatility in global markets While fiat currencies were shuffling positions, crypto assets like Bitcoin barely moved. Bitcoin is currently holding around $108,500, after briefly climbing above $112,000 a week ago. Despite muted price action, wallet addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have quietly accumulated 122,330 BTC over the past six weeks. This accumulation pattern , despite volatile macroeconomic conditions, suggests that larger holders are positioning for a longer-term bullish move, even as short-term price remains in check. Source: Glassnode The Bitcoin price cycle is showing a peculiar resemblance to previous cycles, despite the crypto market’s now massive scale. From the 2015–2018 cycle’s 1076% gain, to the 2018–2022 cycle’s 1007% rise, and now the 2022+ cycle’s 656% surge, the structure remains shockingly similar. That says a lot about the underlying demand for Bitcoin , even with its much larger market cap today. Profitability across the market is also changing. As Bitcoin climbed toward its previous all-time high, the Relative Unrealized Profit metric broke above its +2σ band. Historically, this level means euphoria is rising, often signaling heightened volatility and short-lived runs. Only 16% of trading days in Bitcoin’s history have seen paper profits this high. That’s showing up in realized profits, too. The Volatility-Adjusted Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, which normalizes gains and losses relative to Bitcoin’s size and market volatility, has increased. Source: Glassnode So far, 14.4% of trading days have seen larger realized profits, which means more investors are starting to cash out, but it’s not yet at panic levels. Meanwhile, the derivatives market is heating up. Open interest in futures contracts has jumped from $36.8 billion in April to $55.6 billion today, up 51% in 49 days. That kind of growth indicates a rising level of leverage in the system. Even more aggressive has been the rise in options contracts, which ballooned from $20.4 billion to a new all-time high of $46.2 billion. That’s a $25.8 billion increase, far outpacing the futures market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The loss of upward momentum is now accompanied by signs waning bullish sentiment among market participants trading options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). That's evident from the one-year put-call skew, which reflects how the market prices in volatility risk for put options, offering downside protection relative to calls, representing bullish bets. Negative values represent a bullish bias while positive values suggest fears of downside. IBIT's one-year skew has bounced to nearly zero from the four-month low of minus 3.8 two weeks ago, according to data source Market Chameleon . In other words, IBIT options traders are no longer chasing upside via options. Perhaps they are expecting a pullback. Similar mood is evident in Deribit-listed options where the short-term call skew has weakened, meaning calls expiring in the next two weeks are trading at par with puts, according to data source Amberdata.

2025-05-29T11:10:47.000Z,"Altcoin Season Index Holds at 25: Is Bitcoin Season Here?","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Holds at 25: Is Bitcoin Season Here? Are you watching the cryptocurrency market, wondering whether it’s the right time to focus on Bitcoin or explore the vast world of altcoins? A key indicator many traders and investors track is the Altcoin Season Index . This metric offers a snapshot of whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. As of a recent reading, the index sits at a level suggesting a clear market phase: Bitcoin Season . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index Let’s break down what the Altcoin Season Index actually is. Tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, it’s designed to give you a quick gauge of the market’s current temperature regarding altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. What it Measures: The index compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin. Timeframe: It looks at performance over the past 90 days. This rolling window gives a sense of the recent trend. The Score: The index provides a score ranging from 1 to 100. A high score suggests altcoins are generally doing better than Bitcoin, while a low score indicates the opposite. Think of it like a speedometer for altcoin momentum compared to Bitcoin. Is it Bitcoin Season ? The Index Says Yes According to the latest data, the Altcoin Season Index registered a value of 25. Based on the index’s methodology, this specific level falls squarely into the definition of Bitcoin Season . How is this determined? The index sets clear thresholds: Altcoin Season: This occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score will typically be high (above 75). Bitcoin Season: This occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score will be low (at or below 25). Neither: Scores between 25 and 75 indicate a mixed or transitional market, where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin has shown clear, broad dominance. An index reading of 25 directly signals that over the past three months, a significant majority of the largest altcoins have lagged behind Bitcoin ‘s performance. Decoding Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season Understanding these market phases is crucial for navigating the broader crypto market . They represent different environments for investment strategies. What Happens During Bitcoin Season? In Bitcoin Season , the narrative often centers around Bitcoin . Capital tends to flow into the largest cryptocurrency, driving its price up, while many altcoins may consolidate, trade sideways, or even decline relative to BTC. This doesn’t mean no altcoins are performing, but the overall trend sees Bitcoin leading the pack. What Happens During Altcoin Season? Conversely, Altcoin Season is when altcoins steal the spotlight. Often, after a strong run in Bitcoin , profits rotate into altcoins, especially those with promising technology, strong development, or growing adoption. During this phase, it’s common to see many altcoins experience significant price pumps, sometimes far exceeding Bitcoin ‘s gains. These cycles are influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, technological developments, and the natural ebb and flow of capital within the crypto market . What the Current Crypto Market Phase Means for Investors With the Altcoin Season Index at 25, indicating Bitcoin Season , what should investors consider? Focus on Bitcoin: The data suggests Bitcoin has been the stronger performer recently. Some investors might choose to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to BTC during this phase. Selective Altcoin Exposure: While the index shows a general trend, specific altcoins can still perform well due to project-specific news, developments, or niche market trends. Research is key to finding potential outliers. Risk Management: Altcoins can be more volatile than Bitcoin . During Bitcoin Season , many altcoins might see larger drawdowns relative to BTC. Prudent risk management, including setting stop-losses and position sizing, is essential. Patience for Altcoins: If your portfolio is heavily weighted towards altcoins, this phase might require patience. Historically, Bitcoin Season can precede Altcoin Season as capital potentially cycles through the market. Beyond the Index: Factors Influencing Bitcoin and Altcoin Performance While the Altcoin Season Index is a useful tool, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Many other factors influence whether Bitcoin or altcoins will perform better: Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, and central bank policies impact investor risk appetite, affecting both Bitcoin and the broader crypto market . Regulatory News: Updates on cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can significantly sway market sentiment. Technological Developments: Upgrades to the Bitcoin network (like Taproot) or major advancements in altcoin ecosystems (like Ethereum’s Merge) can drive interest and performance. Market Sentiment: Overall bullish or bearish sentiment plays a huge role. In strong bull markets, both can perform well, but altcoins often see larger percentage gains during their season. In bear markets, Bitcoin sometimes acts as a relative safe haven compared to more speculative altcoins. Navigating Altcoin Season When it Returns The market is cyclical, and Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever. How can you prepare for the potential return of Altcoin Season ? Identify Promising Projects: Use the Bitcoin Season phase to research altcoin projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Watch for Capital Rotation: Keep an eye on market trends. Often, a strong parabolic move in Bitcoin can signal that capital might soon start flowing into altcoins. Monitor the Index: Continue to track the Altcoin Season Index . A move back above 25, and especially towards 75, would signal a shift in market dynamics. Remember, the index is a lagging indicator based on past 90-day performance. It confirms a trend that has already been happening, rather than predicting the future with certainty. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index currently sitting at 25 provides clear confirmation that the crypto market has been in a phase dominated by Bitcoin ‘s performance over the past three months. While this signals Bitcoin Season , it’s important to use this information as part of a broader strategy. Understanding these market cycles, combined with thorough research and risk management, can help you navigate the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investing, whether it’s Bitcoin Season , Altcoin Season , or somewhere in between.

2025-05-29T11:05:29.000Z,"Reserve Bank of India to roll out new use cases for digital rupee","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to broaden the reach of its digital rupee pilots by introducing new use cases and features for both its retail and wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), according to the central bank’s Annual Report for 2024–25. The central bank said it aims to explore programmability and offline capabilities for the digital rupee, features that may increase its applicability in areas with limited internet access and tailor payments for specific use cases such as government subsidies or corporate spending controls. Currently, both versions of the CBDC are undergoing pilot testing. The retail CBDC pilot is being conducted with select customers and merchants through participating banks, while the wholesale pilot is targeting use in the interbank market. Per the report, the retail pilot has reached 600,000 users across 17 banks. To further scale adoption, the RBI has allowed “certain non-banks [...] to offer CBDC wallets.” The wholesale pilot has also seen increased institutional interest. The scope of the wholesale was further expanded and diversified with the addition of four standalone primary dealers (SPDs), the report confirmed.

According to the report, total digital payments recorded a growth of 34.8% in volume and 17.9% in value. Furthermore, India dominated global real-time payments during the year. The RBI noted that the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) “placed India in a leadership position with a share of 48.5 percent in global real-time payments by volume.” The central bank said several innovative features were introduced to extend the benefits of digital payments to wider segments of society. For instance, the report mentions that the “Delegated Payments” feature was rolled out, allowing “individuals (primary user) to allow another individual (secondary user) to make UPI transactions up to a limit from the primary user’s bank account.” An excerpt of the report.

Open interest increased after the news of Telegram’s partnership with Grok AI. Traders of TON, Telegram’s native token, switched to long positions within hours, signaling increased confidence in the token. Over 75% of all open interest on TON is for long positions, following the recent price revival for the token. TON open interest shifted suddenly, with immediate growth for long positions. | Source: Coinalyze According to Glassnode’s data, TON futures open interest surged suddenly, reflecting the drive to take long positions. The trader’s behavior, however, does not guarantee a sustained rally for TON. In the past, TON has suffered increased turbulence and price drops, as counter-traders tried to liquidate the positions. TON added over 11% in the past day, rising to $3.30. The asset, which has drifted sideways for a while, is still digesting the news of the addition of Grok AI to Telegram. The recent news gave TON a boost, which it lacked despite being the only available crypto asset on the chat app and its native wallet. This also led to accrued long positions, with hopes for a breakout as high as $3.70. TON has now returned to the levels of Q2, 2024 and has shown its ability to break out. TON trades near the higher range for the past month, after a vertical breakout on Wednesday. Now, traders are showing confidence the rally may continue after consolidation. TON trading volumes also expanded to the highest level for the past three months, surpassing $1.3B. In the past, the token’s behavior was unrelated to the entire market, offering gains or stability when other assets crashed. Currently, TON splits most of its trading volumes between MEXC and Binance, offering the potential for a breakout, or another crash to a lower baseline. The recent Telegram news also revived the expectations of a breakout above $10. TON suffers from the general neglect of altcoins, but may revive interest through added Telegram features. The TON ecosystem also carries over $921M in native stablecoins, with fintech connections for USDT payments. Telegram’s TON attempts to regain relevance The Telegram platform aims to increase its relevance and tap the US market, after decreased ability and lost interest in Web3 features. Recently, Telegram banned channels belonging to Chinese escrow services, aiming to remove tools for money-laundering and stablecoin crimes. Telegram stressed its social media features, with the added appeal of its NFT features. Additionally, the app aims to position itself as a venue for legitimate and seamless payments. Recently, Telegram expanded its payment app efforts, after hiring a new VP. Nicolas Plecas will join the team, aiming to position Telegram as a payment app. Plecas, bringing expertise from VISA’s crypto team, will lead the platform’s global payment strategy, including compliance matters and partnerships with local services. Telegram already accrued over 1B users, and has not stopped offering payment options through various tools in the past few years. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

It indicates the central bank’s stance on the current economic climate and its intentions for stimulating growth or managing inflation.

Such decisions are typically made in response to specific economic conditions. While the official statement will provide detailed reasoning, common drivers for an Interest Rate Cut include: Slowing Economic Growth: Lower rates make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, encouraging spending and investment to boost economic activity. Controlling Deflationary Pressures: If prices are falling (deflation), cutting rates can help stimulate demand and prevent a deflationary spiral. Responding to Global Conditions: Actions by other major central banks or shifts in the global economic outlook can influence a central bank’s decision. Supporting Specific Sectors: Sometimes, rate cuts are aimed at easing pressure on particular parts of the South Korea Economy , like the housing market or export industries. This move suggests the Bank of Korea sees a need to provide stimulus to the South Korea Economy , potentially indicating concerns about the pace of recovery or emerging headwinds. How Does Monetary Policy Like This Impact Financial Markets? Interest rates are a fundamental tool of Monetary Policy . When central banks lower rates, it generally has several effects on the broader financial landscape: Lower Borrowing Costs: Banks can borrow money more cheaply, which they then pass on to consumers and businesses in the form of lower loan rates (mortgages, car loans, business loans). Increased Liquidity: Lower rates can inject more money into the financial system as borrowing becomes more attractive and saving less rewarding. Search for Yield: With lower returns on traditional safe assets like savings accounts and bonds, investors often look for higher returns in riskier assets. Currency Effects: Lower interest rates can make a country’s currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking yield, potentially leading to currency depreciation (though many factors influence this). These effects combine to influence asset prices across the board – stocks, bonds, commodities, and yes, even cryptocurrencies. What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact? This is where it gets particularly interesting for our audience. The Interest Rate Cut by the Bank of Korea , while specific to South Korea, is part of a global macro environment where central bank decisions play a significant role in shaping investor sentiment and capital flows. Here’s how this decision, and similar Monetary Policy shifts globally, can influence the Crypto Market Impact : Increased Risk Appetite: Lower interest rates reduce the return on ‘safe’ assets. This can push investors to seek higher returns in ‘risk-on’ assets, including stocks and potentially cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and other digital assets are often seen as growth assets that could benefit from this ‘search for yield’. Liquidity Boost: Cheaper borrowing and increased money supply can lead to more capital flowing into various markets, including crypto. This increased liquidity can be supportive of asset prices. Inflation Hedges?: While South Korea’s cut might be deflationary-driven, globally, loose monetary policy (like sustained low rates or quantitative easing) can lead to inflation concerns. Some investors view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against currency devaluation or inflation, making it more attractive in an environment of aggressive monetary easing. Economic Health Signal: Conversely, an Interest Rate Cut can also be interpreted as a signal that the central bank is worried about the health of the South Korea Economy . If the economic outlook is poor, it could dampen overall investor confidence and negatively impact all asset classes, including crypto. Regional vs. Global: While the BoK’s direct influence is on the South Korea Economy , its actions contribute to the global picture of monetary policy. Other central banks’ stances, particularly the US Federal Reserve, often have a more pronounced global Crypto Market Impact , but regional shifts add to the overall narrative. Therefore, the effect is not always straightforward. A rate cut provides potential tailwinds through liquidity and risk appetite, but the underlying reason for the cut (economic weakness) could be a headwind. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For those navigating the crypto space, the Bank of Korea’s decision is a reminder that macroeconomic factors are powerful drivers. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Macro News: Don’t just follow crypto-specific news. Keep an eye on major central bank decisions, inflation data, and economic growth reports from key global economies (US, EU, China, Japan, South Korea, etc.). Understand the ‘Why’: When a central bank acts, try to understand the reasons behind it. Is it fighting inflation, stimulating growth, or addressing a crisis? The ‘why’ helps interpret the potential market impact. Consider Crypto’s Dual Nature: Crypto can behave both as a risk-on growth asset (benefiting from liquidity) and, for some like Bitcoin, potentially as a hedge (benefiting from concerns about traditional finance/inflation). Its reaction to Monetary Policy can be complex. Risk Management: Macro uncertainty underscores the importance of a solid risk management strategy. Volatility can increase when markets react to unexpected economic signals. The Interest Rate Cut by the Bank of Korea is a piece of the larger global economic puzzle. It highlights the ongoing shifts in Monetary Policy as countries navigate post-pandemic recovery, inflation challenges, and growth concerns. Its direct Crypto Market Impact might be limited compared to, say, a Fed decision, but it contributes to the overall environment of liquidity and risk sentiment that affects digital assets. In Summary: A Signal from Seoul The Bank of Korea’s decision to lower its base rate to 2.50% is a clear signal that it is prioritizing support for the South Korea Economy . This Interest Rate Cut is a key piece of Monetary Policy that aims to make borrowing cheaper and stimulate activity. For the crypto community, this action is a fresh reminder of how central bank liquidity and the global search for yield can influence digital asset valuations. While the immediate Crypto Market Impact tied specifically to South Korea might be regional, the decision adds to the global narrative of central banks adjusting policies, a narrative that consistently shapes the broader financial environment in which crypto operates. Paying attention to these macro signals is essential for any investor looking to navigate the complexities of the modern market landscape.

2025-05-29T11:00:33.000Z,"Crypto Markets Brace For $5 Billion FTX Liquidity Shock: Expert","In a video published on Wednesday, crypto analyst and trader Miles Deutscher devoted a lengthy segment to the long-anticipated distribution of FTX bankruptcy proceeds, arguing that tomorrow’s release of roughly $5 billion in stablecoins could become a pivotal liquidity shock for digital-asset markets. $5 Billion Liquidity Hits Crypto Tomorrow Deutscher reminded viewers that the cash component of the FTX estate—“around 5 billion in stablecoins,” as he put it—enters creditors’ accounts on May 30, the first wave of repayments since the exchange collapsed in 2022. “May 30th might be one of the most important days this cycle,” he said. “FTX is distributing over 5 billion in stablecoins to creditors this week. That’s around 2 percent of the total stable-coin supply.” Related Reading: Crypto Whales On Watch As Over $3 Billion In Tokens Unlock Next Month Because most victims “stayed in crypto despite the FTX blow-up,” Deutscher believes the bulk of the reimbursement will not be cashed out to traditional bank accounts but redeployed in-kind across the ecosystem. “When that $5 billion hits, it’s not sitting idle they’re going to rotate that liquidity back into the market,” he predicted, adding that the inflow “could be the catalyst that pushes Bitcoin to $120,000 and triggers the alt-season setup we’ve been waiting for.” The YouTuber framed the timing as unusually propitious. Bitcoin trades near its prior all-time highs, Ethereum is showing its first sustained out-performance versus Bitcoin this year, and US lawmakers appear closer than ever to passing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. In that context, he argued, even a conservative estimate—where only a few hundred million dollars of the FTX haul migrates directly into smaller tokens—would still represent “net new liquidity that has not been in the space because retail money has been completely dry.” Already Priced In? Deutscher pushed back on the idea that the event has already been priced in: “It doesn’t feel like buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news […] otherwise people would have been talking about it all week. It’s only today that people are realizing this is actually happening in a couple of days’ time.” He called the forthcoming transfers “sleeper liquidity,” stressing that social-media and trading-desk chatter remains muted compared with last year, when repayment schedules first surfaced. Related Reading: Crypto Watchlist: Top Analyst Reveals 5 Altcoins With Major Upside How the funds fragment once they land is, of course, unknowable. The analyst conceded that allocations will vary—some recipients will opt for Bitcoin or Ethereum, some may hold in stablecoins, others will chase speculative altcoins—but the overarching effect is expansionary. “What I do know is that this is net new liquidity hitting the market,” he said. “And what you’ve got to ask yourself is where that liquidity is going to go.” Market participants will not have to wait long for first-order evidence. Redemption instructions inside the BitGo portal are already live, and creditors have until 1 June to complete know-your-customer verification. By tomorrow, at least a portion of the stable-coin tranche should be visible on-chain, giving analysts real-time data with which to confirm—or challenge—Deutscher’s thesis. Whether the $5 billion surge proves a short-term jolt or the ignition point of a broader risk-on cycle, it will close one of crypto’s darkest chapters with an injection of fresh capital. As Deutscher summed up, “This could be a pretty good setup alongside the other catalysts that I’ve pointed out.” The market now waits to see whether the reclaimed funds will, indeed, become the tide that lifts all boats.

2025-05-29T10:55:28.000Z,"Michael Saylor Targets $10 Trillion Valuation for Strategy with Bold Bitcoin Bet","The post Michael Saylor Targets $10 Trillion Valuation for Strategy with Bold Bitcoin Bet appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News What if your $10,000 investment could turn into $1 million? That’s the kind of bold future MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor envisions and he’s betting big on it. The company, now rebranded as Strategy (MSTR), has transformed into one of the most aggressive Bitcoin investment plays on the market. With its stock soaring 1,600% over the last three years, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 42%, Strategy has gone from a business software firm to a full-on Bitcoin powerhouse. Here’s what’s driving the excitement – and what could bring it all down. Saylor’s $10 Trillion Vision Rides on Bitcoin’s Future Saylor , now Strategy’s executive chairman, says the company could eventually hit a $10 trillion market cap – a 100x leap from where it stands today. His bold forecast depends entirely on Bitcoin. Strategy currently holds 580,250 BTC, valued at about $62 billion with Bitcoin trading around $107,000. Saylor believes Bitcoin could reach $1 million in the next decade, turning Strategy into one of the most valuable companies on the planet. If he’s right, a $10,000 investment today could become $1 million. That kind of upside has drawn in crypto believers who see Strategy as the ultimate way to get leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s rise. The Cost of Going All-In on Bitcoin But there’s more to the story than moonshot predictions. Despite its massive stock gains, Strategy reported a $5.3 billion net loss over the past four quarters. Its revenues have been slipping, and its original software business has taken a backseat. The company is also facing a class-action lawsuit, with accusations that it misled investors about its Bitcoin-first strategy. These issues raise serious questions about long-term sustainability. Strategy’s valuation doesn’t follow traditional stock metrics. It moves with Bitcoin’s price and that makes it extremely volatile. If Bitcoin drops, Strategy’s stock could take a massive hit. Why Stock Experts Are Steering Clear Even with the hype, not everyone’s buying in. The Motley Fool’s Stock Advisor recently listed their top 10 stock picks – and Strategy wasn’t one of them. Instead, they’re favoring long-term winners like Netflix, which has returned over 653,000% since 2004, and Nvidia, which has soared more than 830,000% since 2005. This shows that while Strategy might offer big upside, many experts see safer ways to build wealth. Blockchain Transparency: Arkham Maps Strategy’s Wallets Strategy has long kept its Bitcoin holdings under wraps – until now. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence says it has identified 87.5% of Strategy’s wallets, totaling over 400,000 BTC spread across 491 addresses. This includes 327,000 BTC held via Coinbase Prime, and 107,000 BTC possibly with Fidelity, though those are harder to confirm due to shared custody setups. On May 26, Arkham tracked a fresh 4,020 BTC purchase in real time – proof that Strategy’s once-private operations are now out in the open. While this level of transparency boosts trust, it also raises concerns. Public wallet exposure opens the door to risks like dusting attacks and privacy breaches. It could also limit the “surprise” factor in big announcements that often move the stock price. Bitcoin-Powered, But Vulnerable Over the past year, Strategy’s stock has outperformed Bitcoin. But with its entire value tied to BTC, even a minor dip could cause serious damage. Meanwhile, other companies like Japan’s Metaplanet are taking a different route – holding Bitcoin with simpler, more transparent custody. In contrast, Strategy’s structure across multiple custodians and complex wallets can make it harder for investors to fully understand what they’re buying into. Interestingly, despite the chaos, Strategy’s preferred shares (STRK) have climbed past $102 – a six-month high – while its common stock has dropped to around $364.52, closely following Bitcoin’s recent pullback. Strategy’s dream of reaching a $10 trillion valuation depends entirely on Bitcoin’s long-term success. For high-risk investors chasing big rewards, this could be the ultimate crypto proxy play. But for others, the growing losses, lawsuits, and wallet exposure make it a much riskier ride.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/michael-saylor-targets-10-trillion-valuation-for-strategy-with-bold-bitcoin-bet/,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|ARKM","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T10:45:10.000Z,"SOL Strategies plans to buy more Solana with $1 billion","SOL Strategies, a publicly traded Solana infrastructure company, has announced plans to raise $1 billion. The firm disclosed today that it has filed a preliminary prospectus with regulators to disclose its intention. According to the announcement, the company filed the prospectus with securities regulators in all the Canadian provinces and territories. This is only a first step, as regulators will only approve once they have received and acknowledged the final base shelf prospectus. Based on the prospectus, SOL Strategies wants to issue up to $1 billion in securities over the next 25 months. The company noted that it can do so through common shares, warrants, debt securities, units, or subscription receipts. However, it noted that there is no final decision yet on whether it wants to issue these securities, and it only filed the preliminary prospectus to improve its flexibility if it decides to go ahead with the plan later. The announcement reads: “The Company has filed this Preliminary Shelf Prospectus to increase its financial flexibility going forward. SOL Strategies currently has no immediate plans to issue any securities under it and may never proceed with any such issuance.” SOL Strategies added if it decides to offer the securities, its final base shelf prospectus would contain all the terms and how it intends to use the proceeds of the raised funds. The company CEO, Leah Wald, also confirmed this, noting that the filing aligns with its growth strategy and allows it to access capital for any opportunity within the Solana ecosystem. SOL Strategies remains bullish on Solana Meanwhile, SOL Strategies’ plan reflects its bullishness on SOL. The company, formerly Cypherpunk Holdings, recently bought 122,524 SOL for $18.25 million using the initial $20 million of its $500 million convertible note facility. With that acquisition, its total holdings increased to 349,322 SOL. Beyond acquiring SOL, the company also offers enterprise-grade Solana validator services, allowing it to stake SOL for several companies. According to the firm, it has around 3.5 million SOL delegated to its validators, with more than 5,500 wallets controlled by different corporate institutions staking with it. Due to its staking services, it has also invested heavily in security and compliance. It recently completed SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1 audits for its staking platform while getting an ISO 27001 certification. The certifications confirm the company’s cybersecurity and compliance standards. Interestingly, the company has also announced plans to bring tokenized shares of its stock to Solana. In a post earlier this month, SOL Strategies stated that it is working to become the first public company to have registered shares on Solana through the Superstate Opening Bell platform. SOL Treasury adoption is growing The $1 billion plan by SOL Strategies highlights the trend of SOL treasury adoption by public companies copying Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) approach with Bitcoin. Over the past month, two US-based public companies have adopted SOL. These include Nasdaq-listed real estate company Janover, which recently changed its name to DeFi Development Corp. The firm now holds 251,842 SOL after spending $11.5 million to buy 88,164 SOL in April, and it is also planning to operate a staking service on Solana. Interestingly, the company filed a registration statement to raise $1 billion through securities offering and spend the proceeds on SOL. While a real estate firm pivoting to Solana acquisition and staking might seem strange, it is not without explanation. A group of former executives of the crypto exchange Kraken recently took a majority stake in the company. Meanwhile, another Nasdaq-listed firm, Upexi, announced last month that it had raised $100 million to buy SOL and create a Solana treasury. At the same time, Japanese firm Remixpoint also holds SOL as a treasury asset.

2025-05-29T10:30:27.000Z,"Elon Musk Concludes Crucial Government Efficiency Role","BitcoinWorld Elon Musk Concludes Crucial Government Efficiency Role Known for his significant presence in the technology and finance worlds, including frequent commentary on cryptocurrency markets like Dogecoin, Elon Musk recently made an announcement that, while related to government work, carries an acronym familiar to the crypto community: DOGE. However, this DOGE refers to the Department of Government Efficiency. The Tesla CEO has confirmed his tenure in this initiative is concluding, a move that sparks discussion about private sector involvement in public administration. Elon Musk’s Role in Government Efficiency What exactly was Elon Musk doing in a government capacity? According to his post on X, he served as a special government employee tasked with leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This initiative’s primary goal was to identify and reduce waste within U.S. government operations. It’s a mission that aligns, in principle, with the efficiency drives often seen in the private sector, where resource optimization is key to profitability. Musk’s involvement brought a high-profile, unconventional perspective to the often bureaucratic world of government. His background running complex, large-scale operations like Tesla and SpaceX suggests a focus on streamlined processes, technological integration, and potentially disruptive approaches to problem-solving. The idea was likely to leverage this experience to tackle inefficiencies within federal agencies. Acknowledging Donald Trump and the DOGE Mission In his announcement, Elon Musk specifically expressed gratitude to U.S. President Donald Trump for the opportunity to serve. This highlights the political context of the initiative, framing it as part of the previous administration’s efforts to reform government operations. The establishment of DOGE under Trump aimed to deliver on promises of reducing the size and cost of the federal government. Musk noted that the impact of DOGE is expected to continue and even expand. This suggests that while his personal involvement is ending, the structures, recommendations, or processes initiated during his tenure are designed to have a lasting effect. It points towards a vision where the pursuit of Government Efficiency is not a one-off project but an ongoing transformation. Why is the Tesla CEO Stepping Down? The announcement from Elon Musk did not detail the specific reasons for his departure, framing it simply as his tenure coming to a close. Given Musk’s demanding schedule managing multiple major companies – Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), Neuralink, and The Boring Company – it’s plausible that the commitment required for a significant government efficiency role became difficult to sustain long-term. Special government employee roles often have defined terms or objectives. His exit marks the end of a unique collaboration between a prominent private sector figure and a government initiative. While the full scope of DOGE’s work under Musk hasn’t been widely publicized, the stated aim of reducing waste remains a perpetual challenge and goal for governments worldwide. The Broader Goal: Improving Government Efficiency The concept of Government Efficiency is a critical topic in public administration. It involves ensuring that public resources (taxpayer money, personnel, time) are used effectively and without unnecessary waste. Achieving this can lead to numerous benefits: Cost Savings: Reducing redundant programs, streamlining procurement, and cutting administrative overhead can save billions of dollars. Improved Services: Efficient processes can lead to faster delivery of public services, better citizen experiences, and more effective program outcomes. Increased Accountability: Clearer processes and reduced waste can make government operations more transparent and accountable to the public. Better Resource Allocation: Savings from efficiency gains can be redirected to fund essential services or reduce the tax burden. However, implementing significant efficiency reforms in government faces substantial challenges: Bureaucratic Inertia: Large organizations are often resistant to change. Political Obstacles: Reforms can face opposition from various stakeholders, including agencies, unions, or political groups. Complexity: Government programs and regulations are inherently complex, making simple solutions difficult to find and implement. Defining ‘Efficiency’: Measuring and defining efficiency in public services, where profit is not the metric, can be subjective. Musk’s involvement, though brief, highlights the potential for external perspectives to challenge existing norms and identify areas for improvement within this complex landscape. The DOGE Acronym: A Nod to the Crypto World? While the article clearly states DOGE stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, the acronym’s overlap with the popular cryptocurrency Dogecoin is noteworthy, especially given Musk’s history of influencing the crypto market through his tweets and commentary. It’s unclear if the acronym choice was deliberate or coincidental, but it certainly added an unexpected layer of interest for the crypto community when the initiative was first mentioned. For crypto enthusiasts, the name immediately brings to mind digital assets rather than government departments, creating a moment of crossover between two very different worlds that Elon Musk inhabits. Looking Ahead After Elon Musk’s Departure With Elon Musk concluding his role, the focus shifts to how the Department of Government Efficiency will continue its work. The success of the initiative will depend on whether the foundations laid during his tenure, and presumably by others involved, can be built upon within the existing government structure. The challenge remains implementing lasting change that genuinely reduces waste and improves operations across diverse federal agencies. Musk’s brief foray into this specific government role is another example of his multifaceted public profile, blending his identity as a pioneering Tesla CEO and tech entrepreneur with occasional forays into policy discussion and advisory roles. While his direct involvement in DOGE is over, the conversation about leveraging private sector insights for public benefit, and the ongoing pursuit of government efficiency, will undoubtedly continue. Summary Elon Musk has announced the conclusion of his tenure as a special government employee leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Thanking Donald Trump for the opportunity, the Tesla CEO indicated that the initiative’s impact on reducing government waste is set to continue and expand. While the acronym DOGE holds a different meaning in the crypto world, this role focused squarely on public administration reform. Musk’s departure highlights the complexities of balancing private sector leadership with government service and leaves questions about the future trajectory of the efficiency program he helped initiate.

2025-05-29T10:26:19.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Shows Strength as BCMI Signals Early Accumulation Phase","The post Bitcoin Price Shows Strength as BCMI Signals Early Accumulation Phase appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new update from crypto analyst Woominkyu highlights a sharp rebound in the Bitcoin Combined Market Index. This suggests that the Bitcoin market may be entering an early accumulation phase. With improving sentiment and reduced profit-taking, on-chain indicators are flashing a potential upside signal for Bitcoin investors. Here is what you should know. What is BCMI? Bitcoin Combined Market Index (BCMI), developed and popularized by on-chain analyst Woominkyu, is a composite indicator designed to assess the overall market sentiment and cycle stage of Bitcoin using four key on-chain metrics (MVRV, NUPL, SOPR, and Fear & Greed Index). Market Value to Realised Value compares Bitcoin’s current market price to the average price at which all coins were bought. Net Unrealised Profit/Loss measures the overall profit or loss of Bitcoin holders. Spent Output Profit Ratio tracks if coins being moved are in profit or loss. Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment index that reflects investor emotions. The BCMI reading below 0.15 indicates that the market is in the extreme fear zone. This is often seen near macro bottoms, when prices are low and sentiment is negative. The reading above 0.75 suggests that the market is in the state of Euphoria. This is seen at cycle tops, when prices are high and greed is rampant. BCMI: Analysing the Current Status According to Woominkyu’s analysis, the 7-day SMA of BCMI stands at 0.6 and the 90-day SMA of BCMI at 0.45. The rebound of the short-term average, especially in light of recent market corrections, suggests growing investor confidence supported by increased transaction volume and stronger on-chain fundamentals and possible early signs of a bull phase, Meanwhile, the stability of the long-term average suggests that the market is stable, not overheated. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Peter Schiff Blames Himself for Bitcoin Boom: “You Buy Every Time I Say Don’t” , What BCMI Indicates about the Current Trend? Investor sentiment is improving, supported by a drop in exchange outflows and long-term holder accumulation, while profit-taking has declined, as indicated by the decreasing Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). This sets the stage for an accumulation phase, where institutional or savvy investors start buying while prices are still relatively low. In the last seven days, the Bitcoin market has reported a decline of 1.9%. In the last 24 hours alone, the market has plummeted by 0.3%. Recently, the Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high of $111,980 , surpassing its previous ATH of $108,786 recorded in January 2025. Currently, the BTC price sits at $108,492.71 – at least 3.11% below the ATH recorded on May 22, 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-29T10:25:17.000Z,"GOAT Network launches dashboard for first suite of on-chain Bitcoin yield products","GOAT Network has officially launched its Bitcoin Yield Dashboard to accommodate its various on-chain BTC yield products, allowing users to reap rewards directly from the asset. At Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, the network unveiled the world’s first BTC ( BTC ) Yield Dashboard. At press time, the project remains one of the only blockchains to offer Bitcoin yield products that generate rewards for traders directly from the asset, without requiring centralized custody or mining rigs. According to the official press release sent to crypto.news, the dashboard serves to grant users access to the network’s range of BTC yield products, consisting of GOAT Safebox, BTCB/DOGEB Vault, Sequencer PoS Staking and BTC Lending. Users can access the new dashboard through the official website . Dubbed “the Gateway to BTCFi,” the dashboard is now live, providing information for all four BTC yield products offered on the network. Users can browse through the products by filtering them based on risk level, time frame and experience level. You might also like: Solv integrates Chainlink Proof of Reserve for BTC and RWA yield products For “BTC maximalists” or traders that prefer to only trade in BTC, the network offers a non-custodial yield product that offers them annual percentage yield of 2% on native BTC. Through GOAT Safebox, users are able to lock up their BTC for three months and generate yield. The product does not require traders to engage in bridges or expose themselves to other elements of DeFi . On the other hand, the network also supports holders of Dogecoin ( DOGE ) by giving them a chance to combine DOGE with BTC through the BTCB/DOGEB Vault. The yield-focused product is designed for DeFi users seeking yield with minimal risk. It allows users to deposit BTCB or DOGEB on BNB Chain ( BNB ) and earn a 5% APY, backed by real gas fees and sequencer rewards. Next is the permissionless PoS staking of BTC, BTCB and DOGEB. Born from the network’s collaboration with liquid staking Artemis Finance, the product allows users to stake the only decentralized sequencer network in the BTC ecosystem and earn up to 10% APY, driven by sequencer rewards, BTC gas fees , and MEV. Users have the ability to unstake at anytime. Lastly is the Avalon Finance-powered BTC Lending product, which enables users to deposit BTC or LSTs to earn yield or borrow against them with relatively flexible terms. Earlier this month, GOAT Network proposed a whitepaper for its latest update, which would incorporate the BitVM2 protocol into its Bitcoin Layer 2 model. The update would introduce a multi-round randomized challenge mechanism and a sequencer set commitment scheme to address the problems in BitVM2, as well as zkMIPS to accelerate proof generation and a universal operator. Launched in July 2024 by ZKM, the GOAT Network mainnet is a Layer 2 blockchain network designed to accelerate the parent Bitcoin chain. It is described as “the first Bitcoin-native ZK Rollup” designed to generate native BTC yield.

2025-05-29T10:18:41.000Z,"Russia allows banks to offer crypto products to accredited investors","The Bank of Russia has permitted financial institutions to offer certain cryptocurrency-based financial instruments to accredited investors. Russian banks are now free to provide qualified investors with a range of crypto products, including crypto derivatives, securities and other digital financial assets tied to crypto prices, the central bank announced on May 28. A key stipulation, however, is that these products must not involve the “actual delivery of cryptocurrencies,” the Bank of Russia emphasized. The announcement came alongside the Bank of Russia reporting a 51% increase in crypto asset inflows by Russian residents in the first quarter of 2025, totaling 7.3 trillion rubles ($81.5 billion). T-Bank among the first to offer Bitcoin investment products Some major Russian banks started rolling out cryptocurrency investment products immediately following the Bank of Russia’s announcement. T-Bank (formerly Tinkoff Bank), one of the largest commercial banks in Russia, announced on May 29 the offering of digital financial assets (DFA) tied to Bitcoin ( BTC ). An excerpt from T-Bank’s announcement (translated by Google). Source: T-Bank “The tool allows you to invest in cryptocurrency in rubles through a familiar application — safely and within the legal framework of the Russian Federation, without opening an account on a crypto exchange and difficulties with protecting your wallet,” the bank said. T-Bank’s new “smart asset” offering is issued through the Russian state-backed tokenization platform Atomyze and is available exclusively to accredited investors. Direct crypto investments still not encouraged While greenlighting local lenders to offer crypto products, the Russian central bank still maintains a restrictive approach regarding direct cryptocurrency investment. “The Bank of Russia still does not recommend financial institutions and their clients to invest directly in cryptocurrencies,” the Bank of Russia said in a statement. Related: Russia arrests Blum co-founder Vladimir Smerkis on fraud charges The central bank also noted the ongoing government discussions on the potential launch of an experimental regime that would allow certain investors to trade crypto assets like Bitcoin directly. Russia’s estimated CEX holdings are at $9.2 billion In its latest financial stability review, the Bank of Russia estimated Russians’ crypto holdings on centralized exchanges (CEXs) at 827 billion rubles ($9.2 billion). According to the authority, Bitcoin is leading Russians’ CEX holdings with a 62% share, with Ether ( ETH ) following at 22%. Stablecoins like Tether USDt ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) ranked third with a share of 15.9%. Some local crypto enthusiasts observed that the actual figure of cryptocurrency held by Russians is significantly bigger than the estimated CEX holdings reported by the Bank of Russia. “I know that [Pavel] Durov and [Alexey] Bilyuchenko alone have more money in their wallets than this amount,” Sergey Mendeleev , founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved, wrote on his Telegram channel. He hinted that Russians hold much bigger crypto amounts in wallets and decentralized exchanges.

2025-05-29T10:10:17.000Z,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index Hits 74: What This Greed Signal Means","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index Hits 74: What This Greed Signal Means Ever wonder how the collective mood of the crypto market feels? Are investors trembling in fear or buzzing with excitement? That’s where the Crypto Fear and Greed Index comes in. This fascinating tool offers a snapshot of the prevailing emotional state, and as of May 29, it’s painting a clear picture: the market is feeling pretty confident, sitting comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone at a score of 74. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index? Provided by software development platform Alternative, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a sentiment gauge for the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score closer to 0 signals ‘Extreme Fear’, suggesting investors are likely panic selling. Conversely, a score near 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’, often seen when the market is experiencing euphoria and potentially overheating. Think of it like a market’s emotional temperature check. When the index is low, fear dominates, which can present potential buying opportunities for brave investors following the adage ‘be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful’. When the index is high, greed is rampant, potentially signaling a time for caution or taking profits. How Does the Index Measure Crypto Market Sentiment? The index isn’t based on a single factor but aggregates data from six key sources to get a holistic view of the crypto market sentiment . Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average corresponding values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum (strength of trends) to the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume and strong bullish momentum usually point towards greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts and hashtags on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for keywords related to cryptocurrency. A high volume of positive or overly optimistic posts can signal greed. Surveys (15%): Polls are conducted weekly (though currently paused) to gather investor sentiment directly. This provides a direct, albeit potentially biased, view. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin dominance , which is Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. An increase in Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear (as investors might retreat to the perceived ‘safer’ asset) or strength in Bitcoin leading the market. The index uses it as a gauge of market stability and confidence. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ might signal fear, while terms like ‘buy Bitcoin’ or ‘crypto bull run’ could indicate greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index attempts to provide a balanced perspective on the market’s emotional state, moving beyond just price action. Understanding Cryptocurrency Volatility and Greed The relationship between cryptocurrency volatility and the Fear & Greed Index is crucial. While high volatility *can* indicate fear (especially sharp drops), sustained upward momentum coupled with high volume often pushes the index towards greed. The current score of 74 suggests that despite the inherent volatility in the crypto space, the dominant sentiment is one of confidence and positive expectation among investors. It’s important to remember that crypto markets are notoriously volatile. A high greed score doesn’t eliminate the risk of sudden price swings. In fact, periods of extreme greed can sometimes precede market corrections as the market becomes overextended. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Sentiment Signals As mentioned, Bitcoin dominance plays a role in the index. Historically, when Bitcoin dominance rises significantly, it can sometimes mean investors are moving out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, which can be a sign of caution or fear during downturns. However, during strong bull runs, Bitcoin often leads the charge, and rising dominance might simply reflect its strength pulling the market up, contributing to a ‘greed’ score. The way the index weights Bitcoin dominance at 10% shows it’s a contributing factor but not the primary driver of the overall sentiment score, which is more heavily influenced by price momentum and volume. The Role of Crypto Social Media in Shaping Sentiment Never underestimate the power of online chatter in the crypto world. The crypto social media component of the index captures the buzz, hype, and sometimes, the panic spreading across platforms like Twitter. When everyone is talking about the next moon shot, posting rocket emojis, and confidently predicting parabolic moves, it’s a strong signal of rampant greed. Conversely, widespread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) is a clear indicator of fear. While social media can be a powerful indicator of crowd sentiment, it’s also easily manipulated and prone to echo chambers. The index attempts to filter this, but it’s a reminder that high social media sentiment contributing to greed should be viewed with a critical eye. Using the Index: Actionable Insights So, the index is at 74, firmly in ‘Greed’. What does this mean for you? It’s a Warning, Not a Directive: A high greed score suggests the market might be getting ahead of itself. It’s a time to be cautious, not necessarily to panic sell everything, but perhaps to reconsider aggressive buying or think about taking some profits if you have them. Consider the Contrarian View: The famous quote attributed to Warren Buffett (though sometimes debated in origin) about being fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful is highly relevant. A high greed score is when ‘others are greedy’. Combine with Other Analysis: The index is a sentiment tool. It doesn’t tell you about project fundamentals, technical analysis patterns, or macroeconomic factors. Use it as one piece of the puzzle alongside other research. Understand its Limitations: The index is based on historical correlations and current data. It cannot predict the future with certainty. Market dynamics can change rapidly. Think of the index as a useful indicator of the market’s emotional state, which can influence short-term price movements, but not a crystal ball for long-term investment decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Greed Zone The rise of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 74 confirms what many have felt recently: confidence and positive sentiment are currently driving the market. This move further into the ‘Greed’ zone, influenced by factors like market momentum, volume, and positive crypto social media buzz, along with considerations of Bitcoin dominance and cryptocurrency volatility , signals a period where investors are feeling optimistic. While this can be exciting, especially for those holding assets, it’s also a time that historically warrants caution. Markets driven by strong greed can be susceptible to sharp pullbacks. Using the index as a gauge of collective emotion, combined with thorough personal research and a solid investment strategy, is key to navigating these potentially euphoric, yet risky, market conditions.

2025-05-29T10:09:28.000Z,"Crypto expert predicts Bitcoin to hit $147,000 in 2025","A leading crypto analyst believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be headed for $147,000 this year, if one key condition is met. Pseudonymous chartist TradingShot , known for deep technical analysis of Bitcoin’s macro cycles, published a compelling case on May 29 via X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that the top cryptocurrency is poised for another major breakout. According to their analysis, Bitcoin has once again pierced a critical long-term resistance zone within its upward trending “Channel Up” structure, but has yet to confirm it with a weekly close above that level. Historically, such a close has been the ignition point for explosive price movements. “The last two times Bitcoin closed a weekly candle above the channel’s resistance, it rallied 96.75% or more,” TradingShot noted. The current setup resembles those previous rallies closely, both in structure and magnitude. $147,000 Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingShot So far in May, Bitcoin has broken above its prior January 2025 resistance, setting a fresh all-time high in the process. But as of now, the weekly candle has yet to close decisively above the resistance line. That technical milestone is key: “If we get that weekly close,” TradingShot wrote, “we can expect a minimum 96.75% move from the bottom,” which would place the next target around $147,000. Bitcoin price performance This projected move echoes the earlier runs captured in 2023 and late 2024, where Bitcoin surged between 98% and 107% after similar technical confirmations. The trendline in question is part of a larger long-term ascending channel that Bitcoin has respected since its post-FTX recovery, with each bullish leg following a similar pattern of resistance testing, confirmation, and vertical extension. Bitcoin is currently trading at approximately $108,470, consolidating just beneath that resistance threshold. Whether or not this weekly candle closes above could define the next leg of the bull market, or signal a temporary rejection and deeper consolidation. 1-day Bitcoin price chart.

2025-05-29T10:08:44.000Z,"Arkham claims to have found 87% of Strategy’s Bitcoin","Blockchain analysis company Arkham Intelligence claims to have uncovered previously undisclosed wallet addresses tied to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), potentially exposing billions in Bitcoin holdings. In a post referencing Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor’s commitment to privacy, Arkham claimed that it had identified an additional 70,816 BTC linked to the company. At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion. Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did,” Arkham wrote, adding that the amount represents 87.5% of the total Bitcoin holdings of Strategy. Cointelegraph reached out to Arkham and Strategy for comment but had not received a response by publication time. Source: Arkham Intelligence Strategy chairman says publishing addresses “not a good idea” Arkam’s claims follow comments from Saylor about the risks of publishing wallet addresses. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Saylor said that publishing wallet addresses is dangerous for companies holding Bitcoin. “No institutional grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth,” Saylor said . The executive said making wallets public allows every future transaction to be scrutinized, exposing a company to risks that may not be immediately apparent. To highlight his point, Saylor suggested using artificial intelligence to explore the issue. Saylor said if a user puts AI in deep think mode and asks about security problems associated with publishing wallet addresses, the executive said the response could get “50 pages” of security problems. Related: Metaplanet issues $21M in bonds to buy Bitcoin, a day after $50M raise Arkham previously accused of mislabelling wallets While blockchain data is publicly available, the accuracy of claims related to wallet ownership has been questioned before.

2025-05-29T10:01:08.000Z,"Norwegian Brokerage Firm K33 Commits $6.2M to Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","Norwegian crypto firm K33 has announced plans to purchase and hold Bitcoin using newly raised funds, joining the growing list of public companies investing in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. On May 28, the brokerage revealed it had secured 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) through a combination of convertible loans and a fresh issue of shares and warrants, with the sole intent of acquiring Bitcoin. CEO Bull Jenssen shared the firm’s bold vision on social media, stating that Bitcoin is likely to be the “best-performing asset in the coming decade.” He added that K33 aims to accumulate as much BTC as possible while building operational synergies with its core brokerage business. “Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build your own?” Jenssen said on X, underlining the firm’s proactive approach. K33 Financing Structure and Future Potential Out of the total 60 million SEK raised, 45 million SEK ($4.6 million) came from interest-free convertible loans maturing in June 2028, while the remaining 15 million SEK ($1.5 million) was raised through the issuance of new shares and warrants. These warrants, which do not carry interest, allow investors to convert them into equity at a fixed price. If fully exercised by March 2026, investors will also be eligible for bonus warrants, potentially raising K33’s total BTC allocation to 75 million SEK ($7.7 million). Based on current Bitcoin prices hovering around $108,000, the firm could acquire approximately 57 BTC. K33 sees this move not just as a store-of-value strategy but as a gateway to expanding its product offerings. In its Q1 interim report, the firm revealed plans to leverage the Bitcoin treasury to explore services like BTC-backed loans, partnerships, and new financial products. BTC Holdings as a Strategic Enabler K33 emphasized that holding Bitcoin goes beyond speculation — it’s central to the company’s broader growth strategy. “With a sizable BTC reserve, we will be able to strengthen our financial position while unlocking new revenue streams,” Jenssen said in the report. While K33’s stock closed 1.96% lower on the day of the announcement, other companies have seen mixed reactions. GameStop gained nearly 12% in March after revealing its Bitcoin plans, only to fall 11% after confirming its first BTC purchase. Blockchain Group, on the other hand, saw its stock surge 225% in November following a similar move.

2025-05-29T10:00:14.000Z,"US Tariffs: Crucial Appeal Challenges Executive Power Ruling","BitcoinWorld US Tariffs: Crucial Appeal Challenges Executive Power Ruling While the world of cryptocurrency often feels distinct from traditional politics and trade disputes, major legal battles over US Tariffs and government authority can send significant ripples through global markets, influencing everything from investor sentiment to supply chain stability. This is precisely why a recent development regarding the Trump administration’s appeal of a court ruling blocking certain tariffs warrants our attention. Understanding the Core Dispute: What Are These US Tariffs? At the heart of this legal skirmish are tariffs that the Trump administration imposed on April 2nd. These duties were reportedly dubbed ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs, though the specific goods targeted aren’t detailed in the initial report. Tariffs, in essence, are taxes placed on imported goods. Governments use them for various reasons: To protect domestic industries from foreign competition. To generate revenue. To exert political or economic pressure on other countries. However, imposing tariffs isn’t always a straightforward executive decision. In the United States, the President’s power to impose tariffs is often derived from specific legislation passed by Congress. The Legal Challenge: Why Did the Court Block the Tariffs? A federal court issued a ruling that dealt a blow to the administration’s move, specifically blocking these ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs. The court’s reasoning centered on the scope of Executive Power , finding that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority under a key piece of legislation: the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) . Let’s break down what IEEPA is and why it’s relevant: What is IEEPA? The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, passed in 1977, grants the President the authority to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. It’s a powerful tool designed for genuine crisis situations. The Court’s Finding: The court determined that the imposition of these specific tariffs did not fall within the legitimate scope of IEEPA as applied in this instance. This could mean several things: The situation prompting the tariffs wasn’t deemed a true ‘national emergency’ as defined by IEEPA’s use. The specific actions (the tariffs) weren’t directly related to addressing the declared emergency in a way the law permits. The President’s use of IEEPA bypassed other legal frameworks or congressional authority that should have been used for this type of trade action. Essentially, the court ruled that the administration’s action overstepped the legal boundaries set by Congress, challenging the extent of the President’s Government Authority in matters of Trade Policy when invoking emergency powers. The Appeal: Why is the Trump Administration Fighting Back? Reuters reported that the Trump administration quickly filed an appeal against this federal court ruling. This isn’t just about reversing the blocking of these particular tariffs; it’s a defense of the administration’s interpretation of presidential powers, particularly under IEEPA. The appeal signals several key objectives for the administration: Defending Executive Prerogative: The administration is likely arguing that the President’s authority under IEEPA is broad and that the court misinterpreted the scope of these emergency powers. Upholding the court’s ruling could set a precedent that limits future presidential actions on trade or other economic matters during perceived emergencies. Maintaining Trade Strategy Leverage: Tariffs are a key tool in the administration’s Trade Policy strategy. Losing the ability to impose them via IEEPA weakens their position in trade negotiations and disputes. Avoiding Congressional Constraints: Using IEEPA allows the executive branch to act unilaterally, bypassing the often lengthy and complex process of getting trade legislation through Congress. The appeal aims to preserve this more direct path to implementing trade measures. This appeal elevates the dispute from a specific tariff action to a significant constitutional question regarding the separation of powers and the limits of presidential authority, especially when invoking emergency statutes like the Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) . What Are the Potential Outcomes of This Crucial Appeal? The legal battle is now heading to a higher court, likely an appeals court, and potentially the Supreme Court. The possible outcomes include: Outcome Description Potential Implication for Trade Policy Court Upholds Ruling The appeals court agrees with the lower court that the President exceeded IEEPA authority. Significantly limits the President’s ability to use IEEPA for broad tariff actions, potentially requiring more congressional involvement in Trade Policy . Court Overturns Ruling The appeals court disagrees with the lower court, finding the President’s use of IEEPA was lawful. Affirms a broad interpretation of presidential emergency powers under IEEPA, giving the executive branch significant unilateral power in economic matters. Case is Remanded The appeals court sends the case back to the lower court for reconsideration based on specific instructions or clarification. Delays a final decision and requires further legal proceedings, prolonging uncertainty regarding the specific tariffs and the scope of Executive Power . Each outcome carries weight, not just for these specific tariffs, but for future presidential actions under emergency powers and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches regarding Trade Policy and economic measures. Why Should a Crypto Enthusiast Care About Tariffs and Executive Power? While tariffs on goods might seem distant from Bitcoin or decentralized finance, this legal battle touches upon themes highly relevant to the cryptocurrency space: Macroeconomic Stability: Trade disputes and legal uncertainty surrounding Trade Policy can increase market volatility. Tariffs can disrupt supply chains, increase costs for businesses and consumers (potentially leading to inflation), and strain international relations. Such instability affects all markets, including crypto, which is often sensitive to global risk sentiment. Regulatory Risk and Government Overreach: The core of the court’s ruling is about limiting Government Authority and preventing potential executive overreach by adhering to legal statutes like the Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) . The crypto community is acutely aware of regulatory risk and the potential for governments to impose restrictions. This case is a high-profile example of the checks and balances within the US system pushing back against executive actions deemed beyond statutory limits. It highlights the ongoing tension between state power and economic freedom, a theme resonating with crypto’s decentralized ethos. Legal Precedent: The final ruling in this appeal will set a precedent for how emergency powers can be used in the future. A broad interpretation could empower future administrations to take swift, unilateral economic actions, which could theoretically extend to regulating digital assets under certain emergency declarations. A narrow interpretation could provide more clarity and potentially require more transparent, legislated approaches to economic controls. Global Economic Interconnectedness: Tariffs and trade wars underscore the interconnectedness of the global economy. Crypto markets operate globally, and disruptions in one major economic bloc can have ripple effects everywhere. Understanding these traditional economic pressures helps in navigating the broader financial landscape. Therefore, tracking this legal battle isn’t just about niche US Tariffs ; it’s about monitoring shifts in global economic stability, the balance of Government Authority , and the potential for regulatory actions stemming from executive power – all factors that can influence the environment in which cryptocurrency operates. Challenges and Actionable Insights Challenges: Prolonged Uncertainty: The appeal process takes time, leaving businesses and markets uncertain about the future of these specific tariffs and the broader implications for Trade Policy and the use of IEEPA. Economic Impact: Regardless of the legal outcome, the dispute itself can create friction in international trade relationships and add to global economic headwinds. Setting Precedent: The outcome could significantly alter the landscape of presidential power in economic matters, which has long-term implications. Actionable Insights for the Informed Reader: Stay Informed on Macro News: Don’t silo yourself to just crypto news. Major legal and economic developments like this appeal on US Tariffs and Executive Power are critical components of the broader financial ecosystem. Understand Regulatory Frameworks: While crypto aims for decentralization, it operates within a world governed by laws. Pay attention to how traditional regulatory powers (like those under IEEPA) are interpreted and applied, as this can offer clues about potential future approaches to digital assets. Assess Risk: Understand that macro-level events contribute to market risk. Legal challenges to Government Authority and shifts in Trade Policy can increase volatility. Consider how such factors fit into your overall investment strategy. Conclusion: A Battle for Authority with Wide-Reaching Implications The Trump administration’s appeal against the ruling blocking the ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs is far more than a simple procedural step; it’s a crucial legal battle defending the scope of presidential Executive Power , particularly under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) . The federal court’s initial finding that the President exceeded his Government Authority highlights the vital role of judicial review in checking executive actions, especially concerning significant matters like US Tariffs and Trade Policy . As this appeal moves through the courts, its outcome will not only determine the fate of specific tariffs but will also set a potentially defining precedent for the balance of power in Washington and the legal limits of presidential action during times of perceived economic emergency. For anyone navigating the complex world of finance, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market, understanding these fundamental legal and economic disputes is essential, as they shape the very foundations upon which global markets operate.

Despite that, Pakistan has announced plans to establish a government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, signaling a major shift from its previous anti-crypto stance. Bilal bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council , revealed the initiative at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas , praising the United States for inspiring the move. He emphasized that the Bitcoins will be held indefinitely and not sold, marking a long-term commitment rather than a speculative play. This will be the ultimate chance for Pakistan to become the first South Asian country to take such a bold step into the future of decentralized finance. As of April 2025, the US governments collectively hold 463,741 BTC, representing around 2.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Today, rewrites history.

SOL/ETH weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April. Daily fees peaked in Q1 2025 but have since fallen to near-yearly lows, signaling reduced speculative activity on the chain, according to Dune Analytics.Pump.Fun fee and revenue chart.

During this period, total cumulative fees surged past 3 million SOL as retail traders flooded the network to launch and trade meme tokens. These metrics have crashed ever since, weakening one of Solana's primary value drivers.A May 27 report from Standard Chartered further reinforces the downside narrative.

The retail CBDC pilot is being conducted with select customers and merchants through participating banks, while the wholesale pilot is targeting use in the interbank market.Per the report, the retail pilot has reached 600,000 users across 17 banks. To further scale adoption, the RBI has allowed “certain non-banks [...] to offer CBDC wallets.”The wholesale pilot has also seen increased institutional interest.

New features include “Magic Nodes,” which uncover hidden wallet connections among tokenholders, and “Time Travel,” a tool that reconstructs the historical distribution of tokens, potentially detecting early insider activity or coordinated accumulation efforts.“Historical data in crypto is notoriously hard to access because it gets buried under endless new transactions,” Bubblemaps CEO Nicolas Vaiman told Cointelegraph.“Time Travel changes that.

SOC 2 Type 1 is a report assessing a company’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy at a specific point in time. Such an audit verifies that the firm’s controls meet trust service criteria at the time of the check.SOC 1 Type 1 is a similar report focused on internal controls over financial reporting at a specific point in time.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share. Ethereum no longer ranks among the top ten protocols in terms of fees, creating a supply imbalance that contributes to inflationary pressure on ETH.Sell (put) options ill-prepared for ETH prices above $2,600ETH options aggregate open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $2,300 and $2,500: $420 million in calls (buy) vs. $220 million in puts (sell).

2025-05-28T21:49:46.000Z,"Labor Department rescinds Biden-era guidance for crypto in 401(k) plans","The US Labor Department has officially rescinded guidance issued during the Biden administration that limited the inclusion of cryptocurrency in 401(k) retirement plans.On May 28, the Labor Department revoked a 2022 guidance that had urged fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” when considering cryptocurrency for 401(k) retirement plans. The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”“We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats,” said US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. The Labor Department under Biden criticized the practice of marketing cryptocurrencies to 401(k) participants. At the time, the agency claimed cryptocurrencies posed “significant risks and challenges” to participants’ retirement accounts due to their “speculative and volatile” nature and “valuation concerns,” among other reasons.The American Banking Association (ABA) criticized the 2022 compliance release, claiming that it did not make the guidance available for public comment and review prior to issuance.Related: Fidelity introduces retirement accounts with minimal-fee crypto investingTrump administration shifts crypto landscapePresident Trump has pledged to make the United States “the world capital of crypto” during his 2024 campaign.Under his administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has scaled back several enforcement actions and investigations involving Web3 companies such as Uniswap, Coinbase, and Kraken, while also engaging in policy discussions on topics like real-world asset tokenization and the regulatory status of certain tokens.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5.

This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved.

2025-05-28T13:33:33.000Z,"UK FCA requests public comments on stablecoin, crypto custody regulation","The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has requested public feedback on proposed regulations for stablecoins and cryptocurrency custody.In a May 28 request for comment, the United Kingdom’s financial regulator announced that its regulatory proposals are “the latest milestone on the road to crypto regulation.” The draft rules are based on prior roundtables and industry feedback. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets. At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.”The FCA also noted it will work with the UK’s central bank to regulate stablecoins. Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said, “For those stablecoins that expect to operate at systemic scale, the Bank of England will publish a complementary consultation paper later this year.”Related: UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini reportEnsuring stablecoins remain stableThe FCA said that its rules “aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value.” The regulator said customers must be clearly informed about how the backing assets are managed. It also recommended that stablecoin issuers appoint independent third-party custodians to hold reserve assets:“We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency, irrespective of the value of the backing assets portfolio, with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.“Breeden added that the FCA’s proposals are part of a broader effort to build the UK’s stablecoin regime.Related: UK to require crypto firms to report every customer transactionCrypto custody rules incomingThe FCA’s proposals also introduce new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services, as outlined in a separate discussion paper. The rules are designed to ensure that user assets are secure and can be accessed at any time:“The FCA's proposals would require firms providing crypto custody services, who have responsibility for keeping consumers’ crypto safe, to ensure they are effectively secured and can be easily accessed at any time.“Proposed measures also aim to reduce both the likelihood and impact of crypto firms failing, both in the crypto custody and stablecoin sectors.

2025-05-28T13:19:41.000Z,"NFT monthly sales break 2025 downward trend in May: CryptoSlam","Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) caught an uptick in monthly sales in May after months of consistent decline throughout 2025. Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT monthly sales. Source: CointelegraphNFT sellers dwindle, while buyers increaseMay also showed a significant jump in unique buyers. The number of users buying NFTs rose by 50% to over 936,000 in May, up from around 622,000 in April.May’s figures are the largest buyer count since October 2024, hinting at growing investor participation during the month. While buyers increased, the number of unique sellers continued to decline. In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers.

The analyst believes real-world assets (RWAs) linking with NFTs could reignite the lending sector of digital collectibles. RWA NFTs also showed potential earlier this year.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech.

My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not.
