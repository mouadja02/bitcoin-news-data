2025-05-29T14:52:25.000Z,"Arkham Traces $7.6B in Bitcoin to Strategy Despite Saylor’s Privacy Stance","Key Takeaways: Arkham has linked 70,816 BTC worth $7.6B to Strategy, raising its identified holdings to $54.5B. The findings contradict Michael Saylor’s warnings about disclosing wallet addresses due to security risks. Strategy has slowed its Bitcoin purchases as MSTR’s premium shrinks and competition in corporate BTC holdings grows. Arkham Intelligence has linked over $7.6 billion worth of Bitcoin to Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy. In a recent post , the blockchain analytics firm claimed to have identified wallet addresses holding 70,816 BTC tied to the company, despite public resistance from its co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor, to disclose such information. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did,” Arkham wrote. Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Now Pegged at $54.5B, Says Arkham If the data is accurate, the new wallets bring Strategy’s total identified Bitcoin holdings to $54.5 billion, representing around 87.5% of the firm’s total BTC reserves, according to Arkham’s analysis. The revelation directly counters Saylor’s recent remarks at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, where he warned against exposing wallet addresses. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth,” Saylor said. He argued that transparency of wallet activity creates long-term vulnerabilities, including transaction tracing and predictive behavioral analytics. Saylor further suggested using AI to simulate attack scenarios, warning that the technology could generate “50 pages” of potential risks just from the exposure of wallet addresses alone.

Arkham’s findings come amid heightened scrutiny over its wallet-labeling methods, with past allegations of misidentification—such as those from Mantra CEO John Mullin, who denied Arkham’s claims during the platform’s token collapse. Strategy Slows Bitcoin Buys as MSTR Premium Shrinks Strategy appears to be easing its pace of Bitcoin acquisitions, according to a report from K33 Research . The company, led by co-founder Michael Saylor, remains the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin, but its recent purchase cadence has cooled compared to the frenzied buying seen last November. In its latest filing, Strategy revealed it bought 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for $427.1 million, using proceeds from its ongoing $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering. However, capital raised from the program has slowed. Only $348.7 million was deployed during that week, down from $705.7 million the week prior and $1.31 billion in early May. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributes the deceleration to two key factors: a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, and intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. Meanwhile, Jeff Walton, an analyst at Strategy, has said the firm may one day rise to become the top publicly traded company in the world. Walton believes the company’s unprecedented exposure to Bitcoin, which recently crossed $111,000, gives it a unique edge.

2025-05-29T14:50:59.000Z,"UK Government Declares Firm ‘No’ to Bitcoin Reserves Amid Volatility Fears","BitcoinWorld UK Government Declares Firm ‘No’ to Bitcoin Reserves Amid Volatility Fears In a significant announcement that clarifies the United Kingdom’s official stance on digital assets at the highest level, the UK government has definitively ruled out integrating Bitcoin into its national strategic reserves. This decision, primarily driven by concerns over the inherent volatility of the leading cryptocurrency, was confirmed by Member of Parliament Emma Reynolds, according to reports originating from Cointelegraph on X. For those closely following the intersection of traditional finance, government policy, and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, this statement provides crucial clarity. While many nations and institutions are exploring various roles for digital assets, the UK is taking a cautious approach when it comes to managing national wealth. Why is the UK Government Avoiding Bitcoin Reserves? The primary reason cited by MP Emma Reynolds for the UK’s decision is cryptocurrency volatility . Strategic reserves, particularly foreign exchange reserves, are managed with core principles focused on stability, liquidity, and capital preservation. These reserves are typically held in stable, widely accepted assets like major fiat currencies (USD, EUR, JPY), gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Bitcoin, known for its rapid and often unpredictable price swings, is seen as fundamentally incompatible with these objectives. Governments hold reserves for various critical purposes: To manage exchange rates and support the national currency. To provide liquidity in times of economic crisis. To diversify national assets (though stability is paramount here). To maintain confidence in the country’s financial stability. Introducing an asset like Bitcoin, which can experience double-digit percentage price changes in a single day, could introduce unacceptable levels of risk and uncertainty into a portfolio designed for stability. Understanding Strategic Reserves: What Are They and Why Do They Matter? Strategic reserves are a nation’s assets held by its central bank or monetary authority. They are crucial tools for economic stability and national security. The most common type is foreign exchange reserves, which are holdings of foreign currencies, gold, and other highly liquid assets. Think of them as a nation’s emergency fund and financial toolkit. They allow a government to intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilize its currency, pay for essential imports during crises, service foreign debts, and generally project financial strength and credibility on the global stage. The management of these reserves is typically conservative. The focus is on preserving capital and ensuring liquidity, not on speculative growth. This fundamental principle is why assets with extreme volatility, like Bitcoin, are deemed unsuitable by many central bankers and finance ministries globally. Who is Emma Reynolds and What is Her Role? Emma Reynolds is a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom. Her statement, while potentially reflecting the government’s broader position, provides insight into the thinking within parliamentary circles regarding digital assets and their potential role in national finance. While the original source points to her confirmation of the decision, it’s important to note that official government policy statements typically come from the Treasury or the Bank of England. However, a confirmation from an MP like Reynolds, especially if connected to relevant committees or discussions, carries weight in understanding the prevailing sentiment and policy direction within the UK government . Comparing Traditional Reserve Assets vs. Bitcoin Let’s look at how traditional reserve assets stack up against Bitcoin in the context of national reserves: Feature Traditional Reserve Assets (e.g., USD, Gold) Bitcoin Volatility Relatively Low (compared to Bitcoin) Extremely High Liquidity Very High (easily bought/sold in large volumes) High, but market depth can vary; large transactions can impact price Acceptance Globally accepted by central banks and governments Increasing, but not universally accepted by governments as a reserve Regulatory Status Well-defined and regulated globally Varies significantly by jurisdiction; regulatory landscape is evolving Storage/Security Established, secure systems (vaults, central bank accounts) Requires digital security (private keys), susceptible to hacks if not managed perfectly Correlation Often uncorrelated or negatively correlated with certain risks Correlation with tech stocks and risk-on assets observed; behavior in a global financial crisis is untested This comparison highlights the core conflict: the very characteristics that make Bitcoin attractive to some investors (potential for high returns, decentralization) are precisely what make it problematic for conservative strategic reserves management. Could This Stance Change in the Future? While the current position is clear, the world of finance and technology is constantly evolving. Several factors could potentially influence the UK government ‘s stance in the distant future, although there’s no indication this is imminent: Maturation of the Crypto Market: As the market grows, regulation becomes clearer, and institutional participation increases, cryptocurrency volatility *might* decrease over very long timeframes, though this is speculative. Development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): While different from Bitcoin, the successful implementation and widespread use of CBDCs by major economies could normalize the idea of digital assets in central banking. Global Adoption by Other Nations: If other major economies were to successfully integrate Bitcoin or similar assets into their reserves (a highly unlikely scenario given current principles), it could force a reconsideration. Fundamental Shift in Reserve Management Philosophy: A global economic paradigm shift might lead central banks to prioritize different characteristics in their reserves. However, based on the current understanding of macroeconomics, financial stability, and the role of reserves, a shift towards including volatile assets like Bitcoin seems highly improbable in the foreseeable future. The statement attributed to Emma Reynolds solidifies this current perspective. Challenges Beyond Volatility While volatility is the primary concern, holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset presents other challenges for a government: Security: Managing private keys for vast sums of Bitcoin requires extremely robust and novel security protocols, different from securing physical gold or traditional bank accounts. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still fragmented and evolving. Lack of Yield: Unlike some traditional assets, Bitcoin does not inherently generate interest or dividends. Public Perception & Political Risk: A government holding a highly speculative asset could face significant public and political backlash if its value plummeted. These factors further reinforce the conservative approach taken by the UK government regarding Bitcoin reserves . Actionable Insight: What Does This Mean for Investors? For individual or institutional investors, the UK’s stance doesn’t necessarily dictate personal investment strategy. However, it serves as a reminder of how different entities view and manage risk. Governments, responsible for national economic stability, prioritize capital preservation and liquidity above all else in their reserves. Investors with different risk tolerances and objectives may view Bitcoin differently. The key takeaway is understanding the *why* behind the government’s decision: cryptocurrency volatility is fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of strategic reserves . This doesn’t invalidate Bitcoin as an asset class for others, but it clearly defines its current limitations in official government finance. Conclusion: A Clear Signal from the UK The confirmation from MP Emma Reynolds that the UK government has no plans to hold Bitcoin reserves sends a clear signal. It underscores the traditional, conservative approach the UK takes towards managing its national wealth and ensuring financial stability. The inherent cryptocurrency volatility of Bitcoin is seen as a fundamental barrier to its inclusion in assets designed for security and liquidity. While the crypto landscape continues to evolve, this decision highlights the significant gap that still exists between decentralized digital assets and the established principles governing national economic security.

2025-05-29T14:40:53.000Z,"Bitcoin Price: Analyst Reveals Why Crypto Market Isn’t Overheating Despite Profit-Taking","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Analyst Reveals Why Crypto Market Isn’t Overheating Despite Profit-Taking Are we witnessing the early signs of a market top, or is there still room to run? This is the question on many investors’ minds as they watch the recent price action in the Bitcoin price . While some indicators might suggest caution, a closer look at on-chain data provides a more nuanced picture. According to crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., while Bitcoin short-term holders are indeed realizing profits, the broader market conditions indicate we are far from a state of overheating. Understanding Bitcoin Profit Taking and Market Cycles In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, understanding investor behavior is crucial for effective crypto market analysis . One key behavior is profit-taking, which is when holders sell assets after their value has increased to lock in gains. This is a natural part of any market cycle. For Bitcoin, analysts often segment holders into ‘short-term holders’ (STHs) and ‘long-term holders’ (LTHs) based on how long they’ve held their coins (typically less than 155 days for STHs). Short-term holders are often considered more reactive to recent price movements. When the price rises, they are more likely to sell to take profits, especially if they bought relatively recently at lower prices. Conversely, they might sell at a loss if the price drops below their purchase price. Market cycles in crypto are characterized by periods of accumulation, rapid price appreciation (often fueled by retail and short-term holder activity), distribution (profit-taking), and eventual correction or consolidation. Identifying where we are in this cycle is key to predicting future movements. What Does the Bitcoin SOPR Indicator Tell Us? To measure whether holders are selling at a profit or loss, on-chain analysts use metrics like the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The SOPR is calculated by dividing the realized value (price at the time of spending) by the value at creation (price at the time of acquisition) for all spent outputs. An SOPR value greater than 1 indicates that coins are being sold at a profit on average, while a value less than 1 indicates they are being sold at a loss. Specifically, the Bitcoin SOPR for Short-Term Holders (STH-SOPR) focuses only on coins held for less than 155 days. This metric is particularly useful for gauging the sentiment and behavior of newer market participants and those who are more actively trading. STH-SOPR > 1: STHs are selling coins that are, on average, in profit. STH-SOPR STHs are selling coins that are, on average, in loss. STH-SOPR = 1: STHs are breaking even on average. A rising STH-SOPR suggests increased profit-taking among this cohort, which can be a signal of increasing selling pressure. However, the *level* the SOPR reaches is crucial for context. Recent STH Profit Taking: A Signal of Caution? Axel Adler Jr. highlighted that the 30-day moving average of the BTC STH-SOPR has recently reached a local high. This confirms that Bitcoin profit taking among short-term holders has seen a surge. This is a natural reaction to recent positive price movements. As Bitcoin’s value increases, investors who bought in the last few months see their investments turn profitable and decide to cash out some or all of their gains. This behavior is expected and, to some extent, healthy for the market as it allows new capital to enter and prevents parabolic, unsustainable rises. However, excessive profit-taking can lead to significant selling pressure and potential price corrections. Why the Market Isn’t Overheating Yet, According to the Analyst Despite the uptick in Bitcoin short-term holders realizing profits, Axel Adler Jr. emphasizes that the market is not yet showing signs of being ‘overheated’. This assessment is based on comparing the current level of the STH-SOPR to levels seen during previous major market peaks. In past bull market tops, the STH-SOPR has typically reached much higher, ‘euphoric’ levels. These are periods where almost all STHs are sitting on significant profits and are aggressively selling into strong demand. The current STH-SOPR, while elevated locally, has not reached those historical peak levels that signal widespread euphoria and potential market exhaustion. Furthermore, the analyst noted that crypto demand remains robust. This strong demand helps absorb the selling pressure from profit-taking STHs, preventing a sharp price decline and indicating underlying market strength. Robust demand can come from various sources, including: Increased retail investor interest. Continued institutional adoption (e.g., via ETFs). Growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) or other crypto ecosystems. Macroeconomic factors driving interest in alternative assets. The combination of profit-taking that is significant but not yet euphoric, alongside strong underlying demand, suggests a market that is consolidating or taking a breather rather than one on the verge of a major collapse due to excessive speculation and overextension. Key Takeaways for Your Crypto Market Analysis What does this mean for investors conducting their own crypto market analysis ? Here are some actionable insights: Profit-taking is normal: Don’t panic simply because STHs are selling for profit. It’s a healthy part of the market cycle. Context is key: The *level* of profit-taking matters. The STH-SOPR provides valuable context. Compare current levels to historical peaks. Demand matters: Strong demand can absorb selling pressure. Look for other indicators of market health and capital inflow. On-chain data is powerful: Metrics like SOPR offer insights into holder behavior that price charts alone cannot provide. Stay informed: Follow analysis from reputable sources like Axel Adler Jr. who utilize these advanced metrics. While the recent uptick in Bitcoin profit taking by short-term holders warrants attention, the analysis suggests it is not indicative of an immediate market top. The lack of euphoric STH-SOPR levels and the presence of robust demand paint a picture of a market that is absorbing supply effectively, potentially setting the stage for further sustainable growth rather than an imminent crash. Looking Ahead: What Could Change This Outlook? While the current analysis suggests no immediate overheating, market conditions can change rapidly. Investors should monitor key factors such as: Factor Potential Impact Significant increase in STH-SOPR to euphoric levels Increased risk of market top and correction Sudden drop in demand Selling pressure from profit-taking could overwhelm buying Major macroeconomic shifts Could impact investor sentiment and capital flows Regulatory developments Can introduce uncertainty and volatility Remaining vigilant and combining on-chain analysis with other forms of market research is essential for navigating the complexities of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Balanced Perspective on Bitcoin’s Current State The recent data showing Bitcoin short-term holders taking profits is a natural development following positive price movements. However, relying solely on this observation can lead to premature conclusions. By incorporating sophisticated on-chain metrics like the Bitcoin SOPR and considering the broader context of market demand, analysts can provide a more balanced perspective. Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis suggests that despite the increased selling from STHs, the market has not reached the speculative frenzy characteristic of previous tops. Robust demand continues to provide a solid foundation, suggesting that the current phase is more likely a healthy consolidation or mid-cycle pause rather than the beginning of the end for this market uptrend.

Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin needs to print new all-time highs or the flagship crypto asset may flip bearish. “If we don’t get further highs soon, BTC will be setting up for bearish divergences on longer range charts at a time when capital inflows have been weaker than normal with speculation running too hot. If that happens we will need to wear out another wave of profit taking.” However, the analyst says that the Bitcoin Risk Signal, which gauges whether BTC is at risk of a major drawdown in price, is flashing bullish, and possibly setting the flagship crypto asset up to print new all-time highs this week. “Still, the broader picture is bullish with the risk signal dropping. If buying follows through this week, $114,000 is next in line to liquidate shorts. But right now there’s an opening for a bearish pivot.” Source: Willy Woo/X Woo also points out a concerning trend that Bitcoin’s spent output profit ratio (SOPR), which tracks whether coins are being sold at a profit or loss, indicates investors are sitting on substantial profits, suggesting they may be inclined to sell at any sign of a downturn. “Speculation is going nuts on BTC at a time when there’s plenty of investor profits to take (SOPR). Reminds me of ‘be fearful when others are greedy.’ A lot comes down to how much buying happens this week when US markets open after a long weekend.” Source: Willy Woo/X Lastly, Woo says that investors buying Bitcoin has slowed for the first time since its massive breakout to new all-time highs, suggesting the potential for a bearish reversal. “Capital flows into the network was very flat the last three days. This is an unusual lull in buying on our run from $75,000 to $112,000.” Bitcoin is trading for $107,948 at time of writing, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours.

This is out of more than 4,200 listed funds across all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and commodities. This high ranking underscores the significant investor interest specifically directed towards Bitcoin through this regulated investment vehicle. It suggests that capital is flowing into the crypto asset class at a rate comparable to, or even exceeding, many traditional investment areas. Understanding the Significance of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The consistent and large-scale inflows into funds like BlackRock’s IBIT are widely interpreted as a strong signal of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption . Large financial institutions, wealth managers, and even corporations are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin via accessible, regulated products like spot ETFs. Why is this significant? Validation: It provides a level of legitimacy and validation for Bitcoin as a serious, investable asset class. Accessibility: ETFs simplify the process of investing in Bitcoin for institutions and retail investors alike, removing technical hurdles like managing private keys. Scale: Institutional capital has the potential to move markets on a much larger scale than individual retail investors. Market Maturity: The presence of major players like BlackRock indicates a maturing market infrastructure around crypto assets. While retail interest remains a factor, the bulk of the significant, sustained inflows is attributed to larger players gaining exposure to Bitcoin through these channels. Comparing IBIT to Other Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance While IBIT has been a leader, it’s part of a group of newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Other funds, such as those from Fidelity, Ark Invest, and VanEck, have also seen significant inflows since their launch in January 2024. However, IBIT has consistently been one of the top performers in terms of attracting new capital, often vying for the top spot on any given trading day, alongside Fidelity’s FBTC. The collective success of these funds, particularly IBIT’s dominant performance, highlights the pent-up demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure in the U.S. market. Recent Inflow Snapshot (Example Data): ETF Ticker Issuer Approx. Inflows (Past 2 Weeks) IBIT BlackRock $3.86 billion FBTC Fidelity Significant (Specific data varies daily) ARKB Ark Invest/21Shares Notable (Specific data varies daily) Note: Inflow data is dynamic and subject to change. The figures mentioned for IBIT are based on recent reports. What’s Next for IBIT and Bitcoin? The sustained inflows into the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF suggest continued strong interest from investors seeking exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. This trend could potentially provide upward price pressure on Bitcoin as ETF issuers purchase BTC to back the new shares being created due to inflows. However, it’s important to remember that markets are complex and influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. While institutional adoption via ETFs is a powerful narrative, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. For investors, IBIT and other spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a convenient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin within traditional brokerage accounts. The consistent inflows indicate that a growing number of market participants are choosing this route. Summary: IBIT’s Inflow Streak is a Major Headline BlackRock’s IBIT has demonstrated exceptional performance in attracting capital, with inflows on 30 of the last 31 trading days and accumulating billions in recent weeks. This places it among the elite ETFs by inflows this year, signaling robust and ongoing institutional and potentially retail interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated products. The success of IBIT underscores the growing maturity of the Bitcoin market and the increasing comfort level of traditional finance with digital assets.

2025-05-29T14:21:26.000Z,"Zebec Network price explodes after Science Card acquisition news","Zebec Network, a top crypto project in the payment industry, surged to a record high after acquiring Science Card. Zebec Network ( ZBCN ) price jumped to an all-time high of $0.00617, giving it a market capitalization of over $500 million. It has risen by more than 770% from its lowest level this month, making it one of the best-performing coins. ZBCN spiked after the company acquired Science Card, a U.K. fintech firm with over 50,000 users. Science Card allows users to send, receive, pay, and save money through its easy-to-use application. Users can then spend using physical and digital cards in over 210 countries, while also contributing to research in areas of interest. In a statement, Zebec said : “With this acquisition, we’re enabling students to spend crypto on campus while funding university research with every swipe, with expansion into education payments.” Zebec Network aims to be a top crypto project in the payment space. It offers debit cards that enable thousands of users to spend their cryptocurrencies globally. It has also become a major player in the payroll industry, serving over 250 enterprise clients and processing over $1 billion in payroll volume.

Rising open interest is a sign of high demand and liquidity for the coin in the futures market. However, traders in the futures market still expect the coin to fall as the funding rate has remained negative since May 21. Zebec Network price technical analysis ZBCN price chart | Source: crypto.news ZBCN continued its strong rally on Thursday following the Science Card acquisition announcement. It has deviated from its moving average and is up 170% from the 50-day EMA. The token has also become highly overbought, with the Relative Strength Index and Stochastic indicators at extreme levels. As a result, the coin is likely to retreat due to profit-taking and mean reversion. It is common for a sharply rising asset to decline as early holders sell for profit. Mean reversion occurs when an asset returns to its historical moving averages. The Zebec Network token will likely drop and retest support at $0.002143, the highest swing in February.

2025-05-29T14:20:15.000Z,"Upcoming $11.7B BTC and ETH options expiry event brings volatility expectations","Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are preparing for the monthly options expiry event with a notional value of $11.7B. The current options expiry is still smaller than the expected quarterly event, but open interest is the highest since the start of 2025. The Bitcoin and Ethereum markets are bracing for the monthly options expiry event, which may increase price volatility. Both assets are once again in search of a clear direction. Deribit warns about uncertainty as a total of $11.7B in options expire on Friday. The last Friday of the month arrives with the biggest accrued open interest, before the options close or roll over to the next month. Open interest on Deribit expands as the options market prepares for the upcoming quarterly close in June. 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $11.7B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $10.03B notional | Put/Call: 0.87 | Max Pain: $100K $ETH : $1.67B notional | Put/Call: 0.83 | Max Pain: $2,300 Calls dominate OI at higher strikes, reflecting… pic.twitter.com/VlISVbmL8t — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) May 29, 2025 This time, BTC has the bigger weight with $10.3B in notional value. The put/call ratio for both BTC and ETH signals still notable expectation for growth, but a more cautious positioning. Call options dominate put options for all prices above $100,000. The biggest accumulation of notional value is for the $120,000 call options. The monthly options expiry is often an event that leads to price uncertainty and volatility. Currently, the maximum pain prices are below the BTC and ETH market prices, but the selling pressure will probably not push the assets that low. BTC’s maximum pain price is $100,000, while ETH’s is $2,300, potentially leading to more volatility. Ahead of the options expiration event, BTC traded at $108,513, while ETH recovered close to $2,700. BTC and ETH options reach peak levels for 2025 The Q2 rally for BTC arrived with higher open interest. A year ago, May’s options expiry for BTC had just $4.7B in notional value. The notional value of options increased on Deribit, breaking above $42B as the May expiry looms. | Source: Into The Block The current accrued open interest for BTC and ETH is at the highest level, with almost constant growth since January. After the March options expiry, Deribit carried around $19B in notional value. The market recovery in May brought that value to over $42B. Options markets reacted to the renewed bullish direction for BTC, leading traders to add to their positions. ETH shows signs of outperforming BTC The monthly options expiration event for ETH reflects the recent slow market, as the asset hovered around $2,500. The notional value of just $1.7B for monthly options is relatively low for ETH. Despite this, ETH trading is gaining traction and the asset is starting to outperform BTC in the short term. ETH regained its positions to 0.025 BTC, while being the only major token in the green as of May 29. ETH open interest also expanded rapidly, adding $3B in the past three days. BTC open interest remained near its levels for the past few days, above $37B on major crypto exchanges. ETH is closely watched for signs of sparking an altcoin rally and returning above the $3,000 level. The options expiry event happens as traders are showing signs of greed. The Bitcoin fear and greed index grew to 74 points, up 3 points in a day. The recent setup is seen as a signal for both BTC and ETH to break out following the options expiry.

2025-05-29T14:16:21.000Z,"Want Americans to Trust AI? Decentralize It","A decade ago, Bitcoin felt like the internet in the early ‘90s—niche, experimental, and easy to dismiss. Today? It’s front and center on Capitol Hill. What began as a decentralized outlier many labeled as fringe is slowly becoming a pillar of America’s economy that many consider the future. People can now invest in Bitcoin through their 401(k)s, IRAs, and brokerage accounts. This year, the U.S. created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Roundtables and summits are being hosted at the White House, and pro-Bitcoin positions are showing up in campaign platforms. That shift wasn’t accidental. Bitcoin gained momentum because its core values—open access, transparency, and distributed control—offered an alternative when public trust in traditional finance was eroding. A similar pattern is unfolding today with artificial intelligence. AI Has a Trust Problem AI is booming, but so are questions about who controls it. If you're wondering where your data is going when you use a chatbot, who benefits from it, and why you have to surrender your privacy in the first place, you're not alone. According to a new Harris poll commissioned by DCG , 74% of U.S. respondents believe AI would benefit more people if it weren’t controlled by just a few big companies and 65% don’t trust elected officials to steer AI’s development. The public loves the potential of AI; they just don’t trust the players in charge. That trust gap isn’t new, and Bitcoin confronted it head-on with decentralization: when trust in institutions erodes, the answer isn’t more gatekeepers—it’s building systems that don’t require them. Decentralized technologies rebuild trust by removing human intermediaries, who are often prone to bias, error, or self-interest, and eliminating single points of control. By replacing these flawed gatekeepers with transparent, distributed systems, decentralization offers a more reliable and accountable foundation for trust and confidence, rooted in transparency, resilience, and user-aligned governance. This shift—from human-controlled to technologically decentralized systems—is what makes trust possible again. Decentralized AI: The Internet of Intelligence Unlike Big Tech models controlled by centralized entities, decentralized AI (deAI) is built, trained, and operated across a distributed network, preventing any single party from controlling the system. Decentralized AI (deAI) flips the script on traditional AI by putting power in the hands of users, not corporations. Networks like Bittensor (see Note below) are leading the way by enabling open, permissionless access to AI infrastructure where anyone can contribute models, computing power, or data. This approach levels the playing field for students, startups, and independent developers who would otherwise be shut out of today’s centralized AI giants. Instead of gatekeepers, Bittensor coordinates contributions transparently across a global network, using blockchain to embed trust and reward real value. The result is AI that’s more open, resilient, and fair, where incentives are based on merit, not monopolies. Voters Are Ahead of Lawmakers on Decentralized AI While Americans are still in the earlier stage of learning about AI technologies, they can already intuitively anticipate the advantages of decentralized AI. The Harris poll of 2,000 US adults found: 75% say decentralized AI better supports innovation 71% say it’s more secure for personal data Three out of four respondents say decentralized AI drives more innovation than closed AI, and 71% believe it offers stronger protection for personal data. What’s missing for consumers using AI is transparency and control, and they want to know they’re not just training someone else’s profit engine. Policy Can’t Ignore Infrastructure and Ownership Even with strong public support, the promise of decentralized AI depends on whether policymakers understand a simple fact: the structure of a system determines its behavior and outcomes.However, the regulatory conversation around AI is still catching up, and in many cases, seems to be missing a crucial point. We’re seeing big debates around safety and existential risk, but almost no airtime for how the foundational structure of these systems impacts trust. A centralized model run by a few powerful players is inherently vulnerable, opaque, and exclusionary and will ultimately erode trust. To encourage trust, technological adoption and innovation, policymakers should: Incentivize innovation in open ecosystems Ensure people can benefit from their data Avoid enshrining Big Tech dominance through regulation The same gatekeepers who shaped today’s AI shouldn’t control its future, especially with the public calling for real alternatives. The current Administration has taken a refreshingly pragmatic approach to AI, prioritizing innovation and American competitiveness over heavy-handed regulation and we hope Congress will do the same. Emphasizing private sector innovation and decentralized development lays the groundwork for a more open and resilient AI future. It’s Not Fringe. It’s the Future Decentralized AI is a forward-looking solution to one of the most urgent challenges of our time: how to ensure AI serves the public, not just the powerful. Just as Bitcoin moved from the margins to the mainstream, decentralized AI is quickly becoming the foundation for a more open, secure, and competitive AI ecosystem. The public gets it. Now policymakers must catch up. The choice is clear: protect open networks, reward real builders, and defend the freedom to innovate—or hand the future of intelligence to a few corporate gatekeepers. Decentralized AI isn’t fringe. It’s the foundation for a freer, fairer digital future. Let’s not miss the moment.

Regulatory clarity is also playing a role. Sentora noted that new U.S. federal stablecoin legislation — referred to as GENIUS Act — and a successor to the FIT 21 Act are expected to be introduced in 2025. Follow-up guidance from the SEC and CFTC could enable regulated bank custody of digital assets and introduce formal DeFi oversight frameworks by 2027.

2025-05-29T14:10:02.000Z,"Bitcoin Plunge: BTC Falls Below $107,000 Amid Market Volatility","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Plunge: BTC Falls Below $107,000 Amid Market Volatility The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a moment of heightened attention as the Bitcoin price takes a notable dip. According to the latest market monitoring data, the flagship cryptocurrency has fallen below the significant $107,000 mark, capturing the focus of traders and investors worldwide. This movement underscores the inherent volatility that remains a defining characteristic of the digital asset space. What’s Happening with the Bitcoin Price Right Now? As reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin has indeed slipped past the $107,000 threshold. Specifically, on the widely-used Binance USDT market, Bitcoin price is currently trading around $106,976.01. While seemingly a small numerical drop, breaching a psychological or technical level like $107,000 can often trigger further market reactions. This price point is being watched closely as participants assess whether this is a minor correction or the start of a larger trend. Here’s a quick look at the recent price action: Metric Value (Approx.) Recent High ~$107,500 Current Price (Binance) $106,976.01 Key Level Breached $107,000 This snapshot highlights the immediate impact of the recent selling pressure on the Bitcoin price . Why Did the BTC Price Drop Occur? A Look at Market Factors Understanding the reasons behind a BTC price drop is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Price movements are rarely due to a single factor but rather a confluence of global economic signals, market sentiment, technical indicators, and specific crypto-related news. Potential factors contributing to the recent BTC price drop could include: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic data, inflation reports, interest rate decisions, or geopolitical events can influence investor risk appetite, leading some to move away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Profit Taking: After periods of upward movement, some investors may decide to sell a portion of their holdings to realize gains, putting downward pressure on the price. Technical Indicators: Traders using technical analysis might have identified resistance levels or bearish patterns that triggered sell orders once the price reached certain points. Regulatory News: Any news or rumors concerning potential cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can cause uncertainty and impact prices. Liquidity Shifts: Large movements of Bitcoin by whales (large holders) or institutional players can significantly affect market depth and price. Pinpointing the exact cause in real-time is challenging, but these are common drivers behind a BTC price drop . Staying Informed with the Latest Crypto Market News In a fast-paced environment like cryptocurrency, keeping up with the latest crypto market news is paramount. Price movements like Bitcoin falling below $107,000 are often reactions to underlying events or shifts in sentiment that are first reported through news channels and market analysis platforms. What should you look for in the crypto market news ? Volume Analysis: Is the price drop accompanied by high trading volume? High volume on a downward move can indicate strong selling pressure. Altcoin Performance: How are other major cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum, Solana, etc.) performing? If they are also dropping, it might indicate a broader market sentiment shift. If they are holding steady or rising, the move might be specific to Bitcoin. Social Sentiment: What is the general mood on social media and crypto forums? Is there widespread fear (FUD – Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or is the sentiment still relatively positive? On-Chain Data: Metrics like exchange inflows/outflows, active addresses, and miner behavior can provide deeper insights into market activity not immediately visible in price charts. Staying informed through reliable crypto market news sources helps provide context to price action. What Does It Mean When Bitcoin Falls Below a Key Level? When Bitcoin falls below a previously established support level, like $107,000 in this instance, it can have several implications for traders and investors. Support levels are price points where buying interest is historically strong enough to prevent the price from falling further. Breaking below such a level can signal that selling pressure is currently overcoming buying demand. Implications when Bitcoin falls past support: Potential for Further Downside: Breaking support can lead to a test of the next lower support level as stop-loss orders are triggered and sentiment turns more bearish. Shift in Market Sentiment: It can increase fear and uncertainty among holders, potentially leading to more selling. Opportunity for Buyers?: Conversely, long-term investors might see this as a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, believing the price will recover. Technical Analysis Changes: Chart patterns and technical indicators may shift, requiring traders to reassess their strategies. The significance of when Bitcoin falls depends heavily on the context – the speed of the drop, the volume, and the broader market environment. Actionable Insights from Current Crypto Market Analysis For those engaged in the market, conducting thorough crypto market analysis is essential, especially during periods of volatility. A price drop isn’t just news; it’s data that informs potential actions. Actionable insights derived from current crypto market analysis could include: Review Your Strategy: Does your investment plan account for volatility? Are you a long-term holder or a short-term trader? This dip might test your conviction. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Market dips are a stark reminder of the risks involved. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t panic sell based on fear. Look at the fundamentals, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin, and reliable analysis before making decisions. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Some investors use dips as opportunities to buy a fixed dollar amount of Bitcoin regularly, regardless of price, potentially lowering their average cost over time. Set Alerts: Use price alerts to notify you of significant movements so you can react according to your plan. Effective crypto market analysis involves more than just looking at price charts; it requires understanding context, sentiment, and having a predefined strategy. Challenges and Opportunities in a Volatile Market The primary challenge highlighted by events like Bitcoin falling below $107,000 is market volatility. This can lead to significant unrealized or realized losses for investors who are not prepared. Emotional decision-making, often driven by fear or greed during rapid price swings, is another major hurdle. However, volatility also presents opportunities. For those with a long-term perspective, dips can be buying opportunities at potentially lower prices. Traders may find opportunities in both upward and downward movements through various trading strategies. Conclusion: Navigating the Dip Bitcoin’s recent dip below $107,000 serves as a fresh reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While short-term price movements can be unsettling, particularly a BTC price drop below a key level, it’s crucial to view them within the broader context of Bitcoin’s history and the evolving digital asset landscape. Staying informed with reliable crypto market news , conducting your own crypto market analysis , and sticking to a well-thought-out investment strategy are the most effective ways to navigate periods when Bitcoin falls . The market continues to mature, but volatility remains a constant companion on this exciting journey.

2025-05-29T14:07:03.000Z,"Nasdaq leads stocks higher as court blocks Trump tariffs","Stocks traded higher on Thursday, as risk-on sentiment engulfed investors following a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Nasdaq Composite opened 1.3% higher, and the S&P 500 rose 0.7% as investors appeared to cheer the latest news on tariffs. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained slightly, opening 50 points higher. Stocks moved up in after-hours trading on Wednesday, buoyed by Nvidia’s earnings report. Investors also seized on another dose of optimism—the U.S. Court of International Trade’s three-judge panel decision that blocked some of Trump’s tariffs on various countries. This latest stock market swing continued a trend that has largely stemmed from investor jitters since President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. Over the past several months, stocks have regularly moved higher amid news of negotiations, trade deals, or pauses, and lower amid fresh threats, such as when Trump recommended a 50% tariff on the European Union. You might also like: Dow drops 245 points as Fed minutes spooks Wall Street While the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump overstepped his authority as given in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, White House has appealed the decision. More notably, experts from Goldman Sachs have cautioned that while the legal tussle shapes up, President Trump’s administration may have other tools to impose the targeted tariffs. Recently, Dow rose sharply as Trump announced a delay to the implementation until July 9 if the U.S and EU fail to reach a deal. As well as stocks, oil prices jumped and the Treasury yields stayed flat. In crypto, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was largely unchanged near $108k. SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci commented on the tariff block via X, suggesting these developments are perfect for BTC to explode. Thank you DOGE for erasing the illusion government can cut $2 trillion. Now the tariff revenue blocked and won’t help offset increased big beautiful spending. Can bitcoin just go to $500k already. — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) May 29, 2025 Wall Street was also slightly upbeat after fresh U.S. economic data showed gross domestic product shrank 0.2% quarter over quarter in Q1 2025, compared to the expected 0.3%. Meanwhile, jobless claims rose by 14,000 to 240,000 for the week ending May 24, 2025, above expectations of 229,000 and up from the previous week’s 226,000. Earlier, minutes from the Federal Reserve’s May monetary policy meeting highlighted continued uncertainty about the economic outlook, with officials noting a weakened outlook for growth.

2025-05-29T14:02:08.000Z,"Surprise Country with Binance Founder CZ as Advisor Announces They Will Establish Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve! \""Thank You USA!\""","US President Donald Trump continues to inspire other countries. The latest country to do so is Pakistan. Accordingly, at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference held in Las Vegas from May 27-29, Pakistan announced that it will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Speaking at the conference, Bilal Bin Saqib, the cryptocurrency advisor to the Pakistani prime minister, announced that the Pakistani government will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Bilal Bin Saqib, who is also the CEO of Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), stated that Pakistan’s decision to go Bitcoin was inspired by the US move to create its own Bitcoin reserve. “Today is a very historic day. Today, I am announcing that the government of Pakistan will be establishing its own government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and we want to thank the United States again because we were inspired by them.” This decision represents a significant shift from the Pakistani government’s previous stance that it would never legalize Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, as Pakistan had previously maintained that cryptocurrencies would never be legal in the country. However, Patistan’s attitude towards crypto began to change earlier this year. The Pakistani government initially established a “National Crypto Council” in February 2025. This council was established to oversee the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and attract foreign investment. Related News: JUST IN!

The Norwegian company noted in its announcement that it acquired the digital currency in order to establish a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The firm said it secured financing through convertible loans and a new issue of shares and warrants. K33 also revealed that the warrants are zero-interest securities that investors can later convert into equity at the same price. K33 plans to accumulate as much BTC as possible 📢 PRESS RELEASE: K33 secures financing of SEK 60 million to buy bitcoin and launch its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. Read the press release here: https://t.co/zRPFCWag5P pic.twitter.com/qAha0lpKnt — K33 (@K33HQ) May 28, 2025 K33 CEO Bull Jensen believes Bitcoin will be the best-performing asset in the coming decade. He said his goal with the brokerage firm is to accumulate as much BTC as possible, while unlocking powerful operational synergies with the company. The firm’s official also said the crypto company drew inspiration from best practices across the industry. The Norwegian firm announced on May 38 that K33 plans to establish a Bitcoin treasury strategy after it gathered 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) to acquire BTC. Jensen said his company hopes to use its Bitcoin holdings as a foundation to offer new services, such as BTC-backed lending. He also questioned the need to wait for the government to build a BTC reserve when you can build your own, adding that initial financing is secured and the company is “ready to accelerate from here.” “The launch of our Bitcoin Treasury Strategy marks a major milestone for K33 and is a leap forward on our strategy. I am excited to now start the process of building a strong balance sheet backed by Bitcoin, not only as a strong conviction investment but, more importantly, as a strategic enabler for K33 as a leading cryptocurrency broker.” – Bull Jensen , CEO of K33. K33 revealed that the zero-interest convertible loans totaling 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million) will mature on June 30, 2028. The company added that the remaining 15 million Swedish krona ($1.5 million) will come through a new share issuance and warrants. According to the brokerage firm, investors are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate if they convert their warrants before March 2026. If the company’s plan is finalized, it could raise 75 million Swedish krona ($7.7 million) for its Bitcoin purchases. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is currently exchanging hands around $108,850, a 14.28% jump in the last month. Data from Google Finance showed that K33’s share price traded flat with the news of its Bitcoin treasury pivot and closed on May 28, trading down 1.96%. The crypto firm also revealed its revenue for the first quarter of this year climbed to SEK 450 million ($46.6 million), up 200% year-on-year. K33 wants to use the treasury to offer new services In K33’s interim report for Q1 2025, released May 28, Jensen noted that the company is working with other Bitcoin treasury firms in the Nordics. He said the companies hope to use K33’s treasury as a foundation to offer new services, such as BTC-backed lending. The company’s CEO said K33 regards Bitcoin as a high-conviction asset and a strategic enabler. He believes that with a sizable BTC reserve, the company will be able to strengthen its financial position while unlocking new revenue streams, product capabilities, and partnerships. The crypto firm’s Head of Research, Vetle Lunde, said in a report published Tuesday that K33’s move to accumulate Bitcoin aligns with similar strategies adopted by firms like Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet . He also noted that while Strategy remains a major buyer, the pace of its acquisitions has slowed in recent weeks. Lunde argued that the slowdown can be attributed to a narrowing premium on Strategy’s Class A common stock (MSTR) relative to its BTC holdings . He also attributed the slowdown to the growing competition in the corporate Bitcoin accumulation race. Metaplanet also announced Thursday the issuance of its 17th Series of Ordinary Bonds to EVO FUND. The firm revealed that it issued $21 million in zero-interest bonds to purchase additional Bitcoin.

2025-05-29T14:00:11.000Z,"Saudi Prince Backs First XRP Treasury Company With $100 Million War Chest","Nasdaq-listed VivoPower International PLC has secured a $121 million Regulation S private placement that will fund what it calls the world’s first publicly traded XRP-centric corporate treasury, a move spearheaded by His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, whose Eleventh Holding Company committed roughly $100 million to the round. VivoPower Bets On XRP In the subscription agreements, investors purchased 20 million new ordinary shares at $6.05—one cent above the previous close—giving VivoPower an immediate cash position that Executive Chairman Kevin Chin described as “transformational.” The prince’s check is the largest single outlay yet disclosed for an on-balance-sheet XRP reserve and vaults the London-headquartered sustainable-energy firm into digital-asset history as “the first public company executing on an XRP-focused treasury and DeFi strategy,” according to the company’s statement . “We have been investors in the digital-asset sector for a decade and have been long-term holders of XRP,” Prince Abdulaziz said. “Having met with President Trump and his leadership group during their recent visit to Saudi Arabia, we believe the timing is appropriate for digital assets and blockchain technology to be rolled out in the Kingdom and we are delighted to be assisting VivoPower in this regard.” Chin, himself an early adopter, told shareholders the influx “allows us to scale a publicly listed XRP-focused treasury company for the benefit of the community and VivoPower stakeholders alike,” adding that potential ledger-based payment rails could ease cross-border frictions faced by the firm’s electric-vehicle unit Tembo and power-to-X subsidiary Caret Digital. Former Ripple board member and SBI Ripple Asia co-founder Adam Traidman, who joined VivoPower as chair of a new advisory board and invested personally in the placement, called the initiative “a forward-thinking move that reflects growing institutional conviction in real-world blockchain applications.” The company intends to deploy “the majority” of proceeds to accumulate the token and to seed decentralized-finance projects on the XRP Ledger. Remaining funds will cut debt and supply working capital ahead of planned spin-offs of Tembo and Caret Digital, both targeted for completion before the end of the third quarter. Closing of the placement awaits a shareholder vote scheduled for 18 June 2025 and other customary conditions. VivoPower highlighted language in the March White House executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and US Digital Asset Stockpile, contending that XRP “is expected to be one of five digital assets that will be accumulated by the US Government as part of President Donald Trump’s recently announced Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile.” The announcement drew swift reaction on X. Analyst @nietzbux called the deal “one of the more bullish events in XRP history,” likening VivoPower to a “ MicroStrategy for XRP.” Popular commentator @AbsGMCrypto added that the prince’s timing, following his meeting with President Trump, is “massive news.” If shareholders ratify the raise next month, VivoPower will hold a nine-figure pool of the token on its balance sheet, providing the first real-time test of whether a single-token corporate treasury can reproduce—and perhaps broaden—the playbook that rewrote Bitcoin’s relationship with publicly traded capital.

2025-05-29T13:51:19.000Z,"Price Prediction For Ripple (XRP) and New Trending Cryptocurrency: $5, $10, or $15?","The post Price Prediction For Ripple (XRP) and New Trending Cryptocurrency: $5, $10, or $15? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Price prediction for XRP and new cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , are sparking excitement in the crypto market. After many months of holding steady, XRP has begun to show signs that it may be rising. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining interest because its Phase 5 presale is running, with tokens selling for a price of $0.03. People are looking at both these industries for big returns in 2025. XRP’s technical patterns suggest a breakout, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a guaranteed 100% ROI at its $0.06 launch price. With $9,400,000 raised and over 515 million tokens sold to 11,300 holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction. But what is their potential to hit $5, $10, or $15? XRP’s Bullish Surge XRP is flashing promising signals for investors. A Golden Cross on its weekly RSI indicates strong upward momentum. This rare pattern, unseen for years, suggests XRP could break past $3.33 soon. Analysts see short-term targets at $2.68, $2.95, and $3.39. Some even predict a climb to $5.85 in 2025. XRP’s market cap has grown 2% this quarter, outpacing declines in other crypto coins like Bitcoin. Daily active wallets have surged 142%, and new addresses are up 210%. These metrics signal robust adoption. However, crypto prices face resistance at $2.30. A drop below could push XRP to $2.10, testing investor confidence. Still, XRP’s momentum is undeniable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor interest in Phase 5 of its presale. Priced at $0.03, the token has risen 200% from its opening phase at $0.01. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. At launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will list at $0.06, ensuring a 100% ROI for current buyers. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $3, offering a 9,900% return. The project has raised $9,400,000, with 515 million tokens sold to 11,300 holders. This demand underscores Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal in the crypto investment space. The team recently launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks, adding further incentive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining crypto lending with a dual-model system. Its Peer-to-Contract approach lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools for passive income. Because these interest rates can be changed automatically, both lenders and borrowers are better off. Peer-to-Peer encourages one user to lend to another, increasing both openness and control for users. Since Mutuum Finance is on Ethereum, the MUTM stablecoin is always worth $1. In addition, using Layer-2 technology allows for cheaper and quicker transactions which many users see as crypto investment pain points. Unlike other crypto coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches its beta platform at listing, enabling immediate user access. This utility-driven approach positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a standout in the crypto market. Security and Transparency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing trust through robust security. The team recently completed a Certik audit, earning a 70.00 security score. No vulnerabilities were found in the smart contract, and no security incidents occurred in the past 90 days. This transparency reassures investors eyeing crypto prices today. XRP, while established, lacks the fresh utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers. The latter’s focus on scalable DeFi solutions gives it an edge. As crypto investing grows, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s audited infrastructure and clear roadmap make it a compelling choice for those seeking the best crypto to invest in. Weighing Future Gains Price prediction for XRP and new cryptocurrency like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hinges on distinct strengths. XRP’s technical breakout and growing adoption suggest it could hit $5 or beyond in 2025. However, its volatility requires caution, with support levels critical to watch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.03 in Phase 5, offers a clearer path to gains. Its 100% ROI at launch and potential $3 post-launch target make it a top crypto to buy now. Both assets hold promise, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s innovative lending model and early-stage pricing appeal to those seeking high returns.

2025-05-29T13:50:55.000Z,"Metaplanet Issues $21M in Zero-Interest Bonds to Fuel Bitcoin Accumulation","Metaplanet has issued $21 million worth of zero-interest bonds to Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment company, intensifying its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The issuance, announced on May 29, came just a day after the company revealed a separate $50 million capital raise, signaling the company’s commitment to becoming one of the world’s largest corporate BTC holders. The new bonds, classified as the 17th series, carry a face value of $525,000 each and mature on November 28, 2025. Unlike typical debt instruments, these bonds carry no interest, allowing Metaplanet to raise capital without incurring additional repayment costs. Evo Fund has the right to early redemption with at least five business days’ notice, and redemptions can be made in full or in multiples of $525,000. Metaplanet may also initiate early redemptions under specific conditions, particularly if future fundraising rounds involve the same investor. As per Japanese corporate law, no collateral or bond administrator is required for this issuance, and payments will be handled from the firm’s Tokyo office. Bitcoin Ambitions Intensify with $135M Raised in 2024 The $21 million raise adds to a rapidly growing pool of capital Metaplanet is deploying toward Bitcoin. Since the start of the year, the company has raised a total of $135.2 million through various bond sales—$25.9 million in February, $13.3 million in March, and $25 million earlier in May. Metaplanet now holds approximately 7,800 BTC , according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, making it the 11th-largest corporate holder globally. Its current BTC holdings are valued around $840 million, with an average purchase price of $91,340 per BTC. The firm aims to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, a goal it is fast approaching with consistent capital injections and strategic purchases. In March, the company secured 696 BTC through exercised cash-secured put options, supplemented by premiums earned from selling contracts. This was followed by another purchase of 145 BTC for $13.6 million in late April. Expanding to the U.S. and Gaining Political Attention On May 1, the company announced it will launch a U.S.-based subsidiary, Metaplanet Treasury, headquartered in Florida. This new entity plans to raise up to $250 million, giving the company access to U.S. capital markets and enabling further Bitcoin purchases. Adding to its high-profile strategy, Eric Trump, son of the U.S. President Donald Trump, joined Metaplanet’s Strategic Advisory Board in March . The broader trend of corporate BTC adoption is gaining momentum as well—on May 28, GameStop confirmed its own entry into the Bitcoin space with a 4,710 BTC investment.

2025-05-29T13:50:52.000Z,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar: U.S. Spot ETH ETFs See Impressive $84.9M Boost","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar: U.S. Spot ETH ETFs See Impressive $84.9M Boost The world of cryptocurrency investments is constantly buzzing, and recent data on U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs has certainly grabbed attention. If you’re following the institutional adoption of digital assets, this is a development you won’t want to miss. Why Are Ethereum ETF Inflows Significant? Understanding the flow of capital into investment vehicles like ETFs provides valuable insight into market sentiment and institutional interest. On May 28, Ethereum ETF inflows in the U.S. reached a notable milestone, seeing a combined net inflow of $84.9 million. This wasn’t just a one-off event; it marked the eighth consecutive trading day experiencing positive net inflows, according to data tracked by Farside Investors. Consecutive days of inflows suggest sustained interest rather than a single large purchase, indicating growing confidence or strategic positioning by investors utilizing these new products. Breaking Down the ETH ETF Investment While the total figure is impressive, looking at which specific ETH ETF products attracted the most capital gives a clearer picture of investor preference. Here’s how the $84.9 million was distributed among the leading funds on May 28: BlackRock ETH ETF (ETHA): Led the pack with substantial net inflows of $52.7 million. BlackRock’s entry into the crypto ETF space, following its success with Bitcoin, continues to be a major market factor. Fidelity (FETH): Followed closely, attracting $25.7 million in net inflows. Fidelity is another financial giant making significant strides in offering crypto investment products. Grayscale’s mini ETH (ETCG): Saw $4.9 million in net inflows. This newer, lower-fee version of Grayscale’s trust product appears to be gaining traction. Invesco (QETH): Recorded $1.6 million in net inflows. Other U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs tracked reported no change in their holdings for the day, meaning their inflows and outflows netted out to zero. What Does This Mean for Crypto ETFs and Ethereum? The consistent positive flow into Crypto ETFs , particularly those tracking Ethereum, highlights a few key potential takeaways: Growing Institutional Comfort: The significant amounts flowing into products from major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity suggest that large institutions and sophisticated investors are actively using these regulated pathways to gain exposure to Ethereum. Post-Approval Momentum: These inflows occur shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key regulatory filings (19b-4 forms) for several spot Ethereum ETFs. While trading hasn’t begun yet (requiring S-1 form approval), the approval itself seems to have spurred pre-emptive positioning or increased confidence in the asset class. Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: Following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, investors now have a similar, accessible way to invest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, potentially driving diversification within crypto portfolios. Market Impact: While ETF inflows are only one factor, sustained buying pressure through these vehicles can potentially influence the price dynamics of Ethereum on exchanges. Are U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs Right for You? For traditional investors or institutions hesitant about buying and storing actual cryptocurrency, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs offer a regulated and familiar investment structure. They allow exposure to ETH price movements without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges directly. However, it’s important to remember that all investments carry risk, and the value of cryptocurrency can be highly volatile. Potential investors should conduct thorough research and consider their own financial situation and risk tolerance before investing in any ETF, including those focused on digital assets like Ethereum. In Summary: A Positive Trend for ETH ETFs The data from May 28, showing $84.9 million in net inflows and marking the eighth consecutive day of positive flow, underscores increasing investor interest in ETH ETF products. With BlackRock and Fidelity leading the charge, these inflows signal a maturing market and growing institutional comfort with Ethereum as an investment asset accessed through regulated financial products. As the market awaits the final S-1 approvals for trading to commence, these early inflow figures provide a compelling glimpse into the potential demand for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs.

2025-05-29T13:49:23.000Z,"Trump Media & Technology: 'Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' Growth Likely A Distant Dream (Rating Upgrade)","Summary I'm upgrading DJT from 'sell' to 'hold' due to its recent $2.5 billion Bitcoin treasury announcement. Despite my prior bearish stance, DJT's valuation concerns remain, but the Bitcoin move introduces a new angle that could limit the stock's downside. A fresh bidder with $2.5 billion in ammo is perhaps wonderful for Bitcoin's short-term price potential. But there is a downside to this announcement, in my view. It would seem to now be politically impossible for the current Congress or administration to meaningfully grow a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, so long as it would benefit POTUS financially. In my prior Seeking Alpha coverage of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. ( DJT ), I've been bearish of the stock and primarily cited valuation and lack of business growth as major concerns for shareholders. While the stock hasn't fallen as far as I expected given the company's valuation relative to the size of its business, it has indeed fallen by over 30% since my initial 'strong sell' call back in October: DJT Calls (Seeking Alpha) In this article, I'll get into why I'm begrudgingly upgrading DJT from 'sell' to 'hold' in light of the company's recent Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury news, and I'll detail concerns I have more broadly for Bitcoin as a result of the announcement. For the remainder of this article, I'll be referring to Trump Media and Technology Group as TMTG. Another Meme For The Meme Stock Riders On May 27th, TMTG announced plans to raise $2.5 billion through common stock issuance and convertible notes for the purpose of buying Bitcoin to be held on the corporate balance sheet. This private placement reportedly includes 50 institutional investors, with $1.5 billion of the raise coming via common stock equity and the remaining $1 billion coming from convertible senior secured notes at 0.00%. DJT shares fell more than 10% in response to the release, and the expected close for the offering is May 29th. The purchase price of the common stock shares through the offering is $25.72 per share - so as of the May 27th close of $23.05, any shares sold through this agreement the day of the announcement are already underwater. In the past, I've argued that Bitcoin itself is very much a 'meme' even though it isn't considered a 'memecoin' akin to something like Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) or Pepe The Frog ( PEPE-USD ). In recent years, we've seen a preponderance of memecoins and meme stocks gaining market notoriety; I would absolutely classify DJT as the latter. So with TMTG now raising capital to buy Bitcoin in the same way that we've seen Strategy ( MSTR ) ( STRF ) and GameStop ( GME ) do in the past, we can add another layer of 'meme-dom' to DJT stock. I have two real takeaways from this announcement, and they both have to do with optics. First, the long-term business prospects for TMTG are likely quite problematic if the company is resorting to this type of strategy. And, frankly, that shouldn't be a real surprise. The company incinerates capital quarter after quarter and recently announced a net loss of $31.7 million in the three months ended March: DJT Q1 Net Loss (TMTG, 10-Q) Despite that, I'm still upgrading DJT solely because equity price declines could be limited from here if the price of Bitcoin continues to go up, as is the general expectation based on recent sentiment and capital flows. Through May 23rd, investor demand for Bitcoin-based financial products has eclipsed $10 billion year-to-date, with nearly $5.5 billion of that net flow coming in May alone. My second takeaway from the TMTG Bitcoin news is specific to BTC. SBR Dreams All But Over Assuming TMTG goes through with a planned Bitcoin acquisition that totals $2.5 billion, it would make the company the fourth largest holder of BTC in the public equity markets almost immediately: Company BTC Balance USD Value Strategy 580,250 $62,407 MARA Holdings ( MARA ) 48,137 $5,180 XXI 31,500 $3,390 TMTG 23,300* $2,500 Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 19,211 $2,066 Source: Bitcoin Treasuries, as of 5/28, *estimated based on $107.5k BTC price It's important to keep in mind that buying over 23k BTC at current prices would have an impact on the market. Thus, TMTG is unlikely to be able to acquire that much BTC with $2.5 billion without a larger correction in the price of BTC first. Strategy was able to buy roughly 25k BTC in May, but the market moved considerably during those acquisitions. Strategy's May purchases started with a BTC price closer to $95k and resulted in a coin price that briefly took out $110k. To be fair, Strategy is not moving the market alone. As mentioned in the prior section, there has been nearly $5.5 billion in BTC acquired through financial products like ETFs in the month as well. But the point is the price of BTC moves quickly when there is a sustained bid in the market, as we've seen so far in the month of May. Given that, my view is that if/when TMTG goes forward with BTC purchases, it would figure to put an end to any hopes and dreams for a larger US government-driven acquisition plan through a 'Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,' or SBR. Through a trust managed by his son, President Trump owns roughly half of the outstanding shares of DJT stock prior to the $2.5 billion PIPE. So when Bitcoin's price rises, it would directly benefit President Trump's net worth. Meaning, any BTC purchases either through the SBR or through a more formal Bitcoin Bill in the United States would be optically horrific for both the President and the GOP. Thus, should TMTG ultimately acquire $2.5 billion in BTC, I expect it would be politically dubious for the Trump administration or Congress to subsequently approve government-purchased BTC as well due to the impact it would have on DJT shares. Simply put, to avoid the 'pumping Trump's bags' with taxpayer money narrative, I don't see a politically acceptable path for the current admin or current Congress to pass the kind of Bitcoin Bill that is being proposed by people like Senator Cynthia Lummis. The negative campaign ads would write themselves. Further complicating any possible BTC holdings growth through the SBR is the fact that the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve currently only holds funds that have been seized due to illicit activities. While the administration has committed to not liquidating those funds, the March executive order laying out guidelines for the SBR stated BTC could be purchased through a budget-neutral allocation strategy. Again, this would seem to be nearly impossible to pull off politically, given that the budget bill recently passed by the US House of Representatives appears to grow the deficit through an increase in spending prior to a reported appropriations bill that may be forthcoming. Closing Summary As of article submission/publication, the Bitcoin 2025 conference is ongoing in Nashville, Tennessee. Vice President JD Vance was a Day 2 speaker at that event and called Bitcoin a \""strategically important asset for the United States over the next decade\"" as well as a \""hedge against bad policy making\"" in Washington. Neither of those assertions should give Bitcoin advocates a lot of confidence that building the SBR is a top priority for the administration currently. First, President Trump will be out of office in less than a decade. So if there is to be any large-scale purchase plan for the asset with a decade in mind, that plan likely needs to be implemented fairly soon. Second, the current administration has an impact on policy in Washington. I would have to imagine the executive branch believes it can influence good policy rather than bad. Thus, negating the need for a hedge on said policy. And as I laid out in the article, even if the POTUS were to encourage rapid SBR growth through purchases in the market, the optics of doing so when the President's majority-owned company owns $2.5 billion in BTC would be a political nightmare for both the President and the Republican Party. None of this means Bitcoin is a 'sell' today. But if you've been buying BTC thinking the United States federal government would start gobbling up coins at any price, I think TMTG buying Bitcoin has likely killed any hope of that actually happening.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790827-trump-media-and-technology-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-growth-distant-dream?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","DJT|BTC-USD",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T13:33:41.000Z,"Spot XRP ETF Approval Confidence Rises Massively","Crypto expert Amonyx (@amonbuy) recently highlighted a significant rise in confidence surrounding the approval of a spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), citing data from Polymarket that places the probability of approval at 84%. This surge in optimism reflects a series of regulatory and market developments that position XRP favorably within the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment products. BULLISH ALERT #XRP ETF confidence soars to 84% pic.twitter.com/Z0jVH1FBWL — Amonyx (@amonbuy) May 28, 2025 The recent launch of XRP futures by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was a pivotal moment for everyone anticipating spot XRP ETFs. CME’s introduction of XRP futures marks the first time this major derivatives platform has offered XRP-linked products, allowing traders to engage with the asset’s price movements without holding it directly. This development is essential because regulated futures markets have historically paved the way for spot ETF approvals, as seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Many market participants believe XRP will follow a similar path and see spot ETF approval on the horizon. The presence of XRP futures on CME strengthens the asset’s regulatory credibility and provides a foundation for issuers to advocate for spot ETF approval. Institutional Desire for Spot XRP ETFs Beyond futures, there is a growing number of spot XRP ETF applications under SEC review. More than ten applications are currently pending, with notable firms such as Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton among the applicants. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These applications have staggered decision dates, with some expected soon and others extending into October 2025. The SEC’s regulatory window allows up to 240 days for decisions, but market observers speculate that approvals could come sooner, given the momentum and excitement among market participants. Similar Products Show Huge Anticipation for Spot ETFs The launch of leveraged XRP ETFs, such as the recent offering by Teucrium, has demonstrated strong market demand and successful product adoption. Teucrium reported its XRP ETF launch as the most successful in its history , showing the community’s enthusiasm and the potential for spot ETFs to perform even better once approved. The convergence of CME’s futures launch, multiple pending ETF applications, regulatory clarity, and robust market interest has created a bullish environment for XRP. XRP is in a good spot, with multiple developments pointing toward a “bullish explosion,” and the approval of spot ETFs could be the final catalyst needed to kick off the price rally.

2025-05-29T13:30:44.000Z,"Bitcoin: Arkham Uncovers Massive MicroStrategy Address, Unlocking Transparency","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Arkham Uncovers Massive MicroStrategy Address, Unlocking Transparency In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, tracking the movements and holdings of major players is key to understanding market dynamics. One entity that has captured significant attention is MicroStrategy, led by vocal Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, due to its substantial MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings. Recently, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence made waves with a significant announcement regarding these holdings. What Did Arkham Intelligence Uncover About MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin? Blockchain data analytics firm Arkham Intelligence recently shared a notable discovery via an update on X (formerly Twitter). Arkham stated they had identified an additional Bitcoin (BTC) holding address belonging to MicroStrategy. The firm’s post provocatively read, “SAYLOR SAID HE WOULD NEVER REVEAL HIS ADDRESSES … SO WE DID.” This newly identified address holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin, specifically 70,816 BTC. This single address significantly adds to the known public footprint of MicroStrategy’s crypto assets. Prior to this identification, Arkham had already linked several addresses to the company. The Scale of MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Revealed by On-chain Data With the identification of this new address, the total amount of Bitcoin linked to MicroStrategy by Arkham Intelligence has reached a staggering figure. According to Arkham’s data, the total BTC amount they have identified is now equivalent to approximately $54.5 billion (valuation fluctuates with market price). This amount represents a significant portion of MicroStrategy’s publicly reported total Bitcoin holdings. Arkham estimates that the addresses they have pinpointed account for about 87.5% of MicroStrategy’s overall BTC stack. This level of transparency, derived from analyzing public on-chain data, offers unprecedented insight into the allocation and potential movements of a major corporate treasury’s digital assets. Why Are Identifying Bitcoin Addresses Important for Crypto Transparency? The ability to identify and link specific Bitcoin addresses to entities like MicroStrategy is a core function of blockchain analytics firms like Arkham Intelligence. While Bitcoin’s blockchain is often described as pseudonymous (addresses are public, but their owners are not explicitly named), sophisticated analysis can often connect addresses to real-world entities based on transaction patterns, timing, and other on-chain clues. This process contributes significantly to crypto transparency. It allows market participants, researchers, and regulators to gain a clearer picture of how large holders operate, potentially reducing information asymmetry. For investors, understanding where significant amounts of Bitcoin are held can provide context for market analysis, though it’s crucial to remember that identifying an address doesn’t predict future actions. Benefits of On-chain Data Analysis: Increased transparency regarding large holdings. Insights into the flow of significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Enhanced ability to track funds for compliance and security purposes. Data-driven analysis of market structure and participant behavior. Challenges and Considerations: Linking addresses is not always definitive or 100% accurate without additional information. Privacy concerns for individuals or entities who prefer their holdings not be publicly linked. The dynamic nature of blockchain means addresses and holdings can change frequently. Misinterpretation of data can lead to incorrect conclusions about market movements. MicroStrategy’s Strategy: A Deep Dive into Their Bitcoin Approach MicroStrategy’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset began in August 2020. Since then, the company has consistently added to its holdings through various means, including corporate debt offerings and excess cash flow. Michael Saylor has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and a superior store of value compared to traditional assets. Their strategy is unique among publicly traded companies in its scale and conviction. Rather than holding a small percentage, Bitcoin constitutes a significant portion of MicroStrategy’s balance sheet. This approach has made them a de facto proxy for Bitcoin investment on traditional stock markets. The identification of their Bitcoin addresses by firms like Arkham highlights the inherent transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain, even for large corporate holders. While MicroStrategy reports its total holdings, the on-chain data provides a layer of verifiable public information regarding the specific addresses used to store these assets. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers For those following the crypto market, the work of firms like Arkham Intelligence provides valuable on-chain data points. While you cannot directly control or predict MicroStrategy’s actions based on address identification, knowing where significant amounts of BTC are held by major players offers context. It allows analysts to potentially track large movements if they occur from these identified addresses, although large holders often use multiple addresses and sophisticated transaction methods. It’s an example of how public blockchain data, when analyzed effectively, can demystify aspects of the crypto market that might otherwise remain opaque. However, always combine on-chain analysis with fundamental market research and macroeconomic factors. Summary: Unlocking Insights into MicroStrategy’s Massive Bitcoin Holdings Arkham Intelligence’s identification of another significant Bitcoin address linked to MicroStrategy underscores the power of on-chain data analysis in shedding light on major market participants. By identifying addresses holding tens of thousands of BTC, Arkham has increased the known transparent portion of MicroStrategy’s considerable MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings. While contributing to greater crypto transparency, this also highlights the ongoing tension between the public nature of blockchain data and the desire for privacy by large holders. As the crypto market matures, the role of firms providing sophisticated on-chain data analysis will continue to be crucial for investors and the broader public seeking to understand this evolving asset class.

2025-05-29T13:30:18.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Struggling To Build Momentum And Reclaim $110,000","Bitcoin (BTC) is up a little over 1% as it looks to build momentum and reclaim the $110,000 level. Price action has been subdued after last week’s rally, which saw the flagship cryptocurrency race to a new all-time high. BTC is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $108,850. Meanwhile, analysts believe BTC has not reached the peak of its current bull cycle, predicting a jump to between $220,000 and $330,000. Arkham Intelligence Claims To Have Found Most Of Strategy’s Bitcoin Stash Blockchain analysis company Arkham Intelligence claims to have identified previously undisclosed wallet addresses tied to Strategy, potentially exposing billions in Bitcoin holdings. The firm referenced Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor’s commitment to privacy, claiming it had found an additional 70,816 BTC linked to Strategy. The latest discovery is valued at $7.6 billion at current prices. The newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If the findings are accurate, Arkham has discovered most of Strategy’s Bitcoin stash and publicly associated the wallets with the firm. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did.” Arkham’s discovery comes after Saylor discussed the risks of publishing wallet addresses. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Saylor stated, “No institutional grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth.” Saylor believes making Bitcoin wallets public allows every transaction to be scrutinized, exposing companies to risks that may not be immediately apparent. GameStop Confirms First Bitcoin Purchase US video game and consumer electronics retailer GameStop has confirmed its first Bitcoin purchase, announcing the acquisition of 4,710 BTC . However, the company has not specified how much it has paid or when the purchase was completed. The Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also provides few details. The value of the Bitcoin purchased is around $513 million at current prices. This is the first time GameStop has publicly acknowledged its Bitcoin purchase since announcing plans to move into Bitcoin investments. Meanwhile, GameStop (GME) stocks have climbed significantly since the company announced its Bitcoin pivot, climbing 12% in March. Data from TradingView shows GME closed at $35 on May 27 and traded at $36.30 during pre-market trading. The stock is up 30% in the past 30 days, with year-to-date gains of around 10%. Bitcoin Witnessing Surge In Corporate Adoption Several other companies besides GameStop have pivoted to Bitcoin since Michael Saylor’s Strategy began purchasing the flagship cryptocurrency in 2020. Companies, including Metaplanet and Meliuz, have added to their Bitcoin holdings this year after adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Trump Media and Technology Group also announced plans for a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin. European Crypto Firm K33 Raises $6.2 Million For Bitcoin Purchases Norwegian crypto brokerage firm K33 has raised 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) to fund planned Bitcoin acquisitions. The company announced it had secured financing through convertible loans and a new issue of shares and warrants, which “will be used in full to acquire Bitcoin in order to establish the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy.” Warrants are zero-interest securities that investors can convert to equity at the same price. The raise would allow K33 to purchase up to 57 BTC at just over $108,000 per coin. K33 CEO Bull Jenssen believes that Bitcoin will be the best-performing asset in the coming decade, adding the company plans to accumulate as many as possible while unlocking powerful operational synergies with its brokerage operations. “Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build your own? Initial financing is secured, and we are ready to accelerate from here!” Jenssen also added that K33 is working with Bitcoin treasury companies in the Nordics, and hopes to use its Bitcoin treasury to offer new services. “For K33, Bitcoin is not only a high-conviction asset — it’s also a strategic enabler. With a sizable BTC reserve, we will be able to strengthen our financial position while unlocking new revenue streams, product capabilities, and partnerships.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned under $110,000 as it struggles to build momentum. The flagship cryptocurrency has been marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $108,730. Price action has been subdued this week after last week’s rally, which saw the price surge to a new all-time high. BTC briefly crossed $110,000 this week but could not sustain momentum, falling below the level. Despite subdued price action, BTC is up nearly 15% over the past month, and analysts believe sentiment around the asset remains positive. Analysts believe that a BTC price peak is still 100%-200% higher than current prices, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency’s uptrend could continue despite the recent pullback. “But yes, I'm sure this cycle has peaked. Bitcoin cycles @ power law fit, a la 365-day SMA. At ~$110,000/coin today, the 365-dSMA is only touching the trendline; history shows each cycle moving 2-3x higher than this.” According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each cycle. With BTC around $110,000, analysts predict a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000, aligning with historical patterns where the price has consistently crossed the trendline during bullish phases. Bitcoin (BTC) ended the previous weekend positively, rising over 3% to $106,489. The price fell to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified but rebounded to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a decline of almost 1%. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,582. However, it lost momentum on Friday and plunged almost 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $107,356. Source: TradingView The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,095. BTC started the current week positively, registering a marginal increase on Monday. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,951. Selling pressure intensified on Wednesday as BTC fell over 1% and settled at $107,834. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $108,560, as buyers look to build momentum and reclaim $110,000. However, a bearish MACD indicates sellers have the upper hand.

It’s building momentum by design, and now, with Live Coin Watch confirming a projected 4X return from presale to launch, the spotlight is only getting hotter. But this isn’t just about numbers. This is a story about architecture, mobile-first access, and a chain finally doing what others promised. If you’re still thinking Bitcoin Solaris is just another new token, you’re already behind. From Bitcoin’s Ideals to Real-World Use Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) starts where Bitcoin left off. While Bitcoin made decentralization real, BTC-S is making it scalable and programmable. It’s built around a dual-layer blockchain—the Base Layer uses SHA-256 PoW for unmatched security, while the Solaris Layer delivers fast, efficient smart contract execution through DPoS. With finality in 2 seconds and up to 100,000 TPS, it’s capable of supporting DeFi, NFTs, and advanced dApps at scale. The chain isn’t just powerful—it’s accessible. The upcoming Solaris Nova app will allow users to mine BTC-S directly from their smartphones . No fancy rigs. No high electricity bills. Just real participation. Daily Wealth, Not Just Hype The way Bitcoin Solaris distributes rewards flips the script on typical crypto economics. Here, everyone contributes—and everyone earns. Mobile miners, validators, and stakers all share the block rewards: 40% goes to miners on the Base Layer 25% goes to validators on the Solaris Layer 20% is allocated to stakers 10% funds development 5% is reserved for community projects The Next Big Shift in Blockchain Has a Name—Bitcoin Solaris Rewards scale with long-term participation thanks to time-weight factors and contribution scores. Whether you’re validating blocks or staking from your phone, the protocol is designed to reward consistent effort, not just capital. Technology That Talks to Itself Cross-layer interaction is where the chain flexes its intelligence. The Solaris Layer routinely commits its state to the Base Layer, and validator elections are anchored in the PoW chain to prevent long-range attacks. The result? A system where security, speed, and flexibility coexist—not compromise. Its smart contracts are written in Rust, and initial tooling follows the Solana development model, making it easy for developers to deploy fast and migrate later. That Solana connection isn’t surface-level either—Bitcoin Solaris integrates with Solana’s infrastructure for bootstrapping, including shared tooling, cross-chain bridges, and compatibility with existing dApps. The Presale That’s Turning Heads It’s not just Live Coin Watch watching this unfold. With the presale running for just 90 days, the window is tight, and the pace is aggressive. BTC-S is currently priced at $5 in Phase 5, moving to $6 next, and locked in for a $20 launch. More than 11,000 users have joined, with $1.8M+ already raised. Plenty of influencers and blockchain analysts are already tuning in. A strong breakdown by Token Empire explores why this presale is attracting attention fast. And that’s the point: it’s short, aggressive, and backed by functionality—not just FOMO. Momentum Is a Signal You can feel it in the channels. Scroll through the active Telegram or check live updates on X, and you’ll see the same pattern repeating: new users, new questions, real curiosity. The conversations aren’t empty—they’re about infrastructure, mobile staking, launch dates, and potential returns. Even before launch, Bitcoin Solaris has been under serious scrutiny. It’s already been reviewed by multiple auditing firms— Cyberscope and Freshcoins —and passed a KYC verification to reinforce trust. Conclusion Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a lucky guess or a viral moment. It’s architecture, incentive design, and cross-layer innovation are packed into one of the fastest-moving presales this cycle. The technology is real. The wealth model is inclusive. And the window? It’s closing fast.

Here Are the Details","Norway-based crypto asset manager K33 has officially launched its Bitcoin treasury strategy, raising 60 million Swedish kronor (about $6.2 million) in new funding to purchase Bitcoin and expand its product range. Norwegian Crypto Company K33 Raises $6.2 Million to Buy Bitcoin K33, which is listed on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market, announced that it has increased its capital through newly issued shares and warrants worth 15 million Swedish kronor and convertible loans totaling 45 million Swedish kronor. “We believe Bitcoin will become an important part of the global financial system. I am excited to begin the process of building a strong balance sheet backed by Bitcoin. This is not only a strong investment conviction but more importantly, a strategic opportunity for K33 as a leading crypto broker,” said Torbjørn Bull Jenssen, CEO of K33. The company emphasized that the BTC purchase is not just an investment but a strategic move to support future product development, including improved trading margins and BTC-backed lending services. Jenssen added that the company is drawing inspiration from industry best practices as it focuses on its next phase of growth. K33’s latest earnings report, released on Wednesday, showed first-quarter revenue reaching 450 million Swedish kronor ($46.6 million), a 200% increase year-on-year and indicating that the company is growing rapidly and gaining momentum toward its Bitcoin-backed strategy. K33’s move mirrors the strategies of other cryptocurrency pioneers like Strategy in the U.S. and Metaplanet in Japan. While Strategy remains the dominant buyer, its pace has slowed recently due to the narrowing premium on its Class A shares (MSTR) and increased competition from institutional Bitcoin accumulation, according to K33 Research Director Vetle Lunde. *This is not investment advice.

What Was the Trump PEPE Post All About? The image posted by Donald Trump on Truth Social depicted the former president himself, with the recognizable Pepe the Frog character, the unofficial mascot of the PEPE coin, positioned on the left side. This seemingly simple act immediately sparked discussion and speculation, given the figure involved and the nature of the digital asset highlighted. It wasn’t a direct endorsement or statement about cryptocurrency, but the visual association alone was enough to generate buzz. Understanding PEPE Coin News and Its Place For those unfamiliar, PEPE is an Ethereum-based memecoin that gained rapid popularity in 2023. Like many memecoins, its value is primarily driven by internet culture, community sentiment, and speculative trading rather than underlying technology or utility. It’s known for its volatile price swings, offering the potential for high rewards but also significant risks. According to CoinMarketCap data at the time of the original report, PEPE was trading at $0.00001493, showing a notable increase of 7.73% in the past day, illustrating the kind of rapid price movement memecoins can experience, often influenced by external factors like social media mentions. Why Does a Truth Social Crypto Mention Matter? The significance of the Trump PEPE post lies in the intersection of a major political figure with a niche, highly speculative digital asset. Donald Trump commands a massive following, and his activities on platforms like Truth Social are closely watched. When such a figure interacts, even indirectly through an image, with something like PEPE, it can draw unprecedented attention to the asset and the broader memecoin market. This exposure, whether intentional or not, can influence public perception and potentially trading activity, highlighting the growing overlap between political discourse, internet culture, and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Broader Memecoin Market The memecoin market is characterized by its unique dynamics. Unlike traditional investments or even established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, memecoins often derive value from hype, trends, and community engagement. Here are some key aspects to consider: High Volatility: Prices can skyrocket or plummet based on social media trends, news, or even simple mentions. Community-Driven: The strength and activity of the online community play a crucial role in a memecoin’s survival and price action. Speculative Nature: Investing in memecoins is highly speculative. There’s often no underlying product or service backing the token. Cultural Relevance: Many memecoins are tied to internet memes or cultural moments, giving them a unique appeal but also making their longevity uncertain. The Trump PEPE image serves as a potent example of how cultural and political events can unexpectedly intersect with and impact this part of the crypto landscape. Donald Trump Crypto Interest: What Could This Mean? While the post itself wasn’t a policy statement, it adds another layer to the evolving relationship between political figures and the crypto space. Donald Trump has previously commented on cryptocurrencies, sometimes with skepticism, but his campaign has also reportedly explored crypto donations. This Truth Social crypto mention, featuring a memecoin specifically, could be interpreted in various ways – from simply leveraging popular internet culture to a subtle nod towards a segment of his audience interested in digital assets. Regardless of the intent, it brings PEPE and memecoins into a conversation they wouldn’t typically inhabit, potentially signaling a growing, albeit complex, acknowledgment of crypto’s cultural footprint even in political circles. Actionable Insights for Readers The key takeaway from events like the Trump PEPE post is a reminder of the forces that can influence the highly speculative memecoin market. For anyone considering engaging with memecoins or interpreting such news: Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR). Understand that memecoins are extremely risky and volatile investments. Do not invest funds you cannot afford to lose. Be critical of social media hype, even when it comes from prominent figures. In conclusion, Donald Trump’s Truth Social post featuring PEPE is a remarkable instance of a niche digital asset crossing paths with mainstream political communication. It underscores the unpredictable nature of the memecoin market and highlights the increasing cultural visibility of cryptocurrencies, even reaching the highest levels of political discourse.

It’s an increase of almost 126% since the start of this year. Despite the boom in open interest, data show a growing caution near the $110k price level. As of now, the bitcoin price is trading around $108,567 , reflecting a slight drop. Bitcoin Options Open Interest Hits Record High According to data from Glassnode, the total open interest in Bitcoin options has surged to an all-time high of $46.2 billion, making a dramatic surge. In early 2025, total open interest sat around $20 billion. Since then, it has more than doubled, adding roughly $25.8 billion to reach today’s peak. This spike shows that both bullish and bearish traders are placing bigger wagers on where Bitcoin’s price might head next. $BTC options open interest recently hit an all-time high of $46.2B – up +$25.8B from the lows. This sharp growth outpaces futures and signals rising demand for more advanced hedging and strategy execution as market participants grow more sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/YXp24CRVfC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 Why Open Interest Matters? Open interest measures all active options contracts that haven’t been closed or settled. When open interest rises, it often means new money is flowing into the market. Meanwhile, a high open interest, especially at record levels, points to growing excitement and potential risk, since more capital is on the line. Key Level To Watch: $110,000 Right now, Bitcoin is trading below the $109,000 mark, and this level is considered very crucial. If Bitcoin breaks through, it could spark a fresh wave of buying that pushes the price even higher. But if it can’t hold, some traders think we could see a quick pullback. The options market’s record size suggests that whichever way Bitcoin goes, the move could be sharp.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoins-open-interest-hits-record-high-as-traders-eye-big-moves-ahead/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T13:17:41.000Z,"Solana compresses near resistance, breakout to $241 likely if confirmed","Solana is tightening beneath a major resistance zone at $178. With bullish structure and a strong upward trend from $95, a breakout could send SOL soaring toward $241 in the near term. Solana’s ( SOL ) price action has been consolidating in a bullish manner underneath high time frame resistance at $178. After a strong trend that began with a low near $95, SOL has steadily climbed while respecting every key support level. Key technical points $178 High Time Frame Resistance: Currently acting as overhead supply, but showing signs of weakening as price consolidates just below. Apex Zone with Dynamic Support: Higher lows are compressing against resistance, supported by rising trendline confluence at $175. $241 Target: Next major high time frame resistance level if a breakout above $178 occurs with volume. SOLUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView What makes this setup especially compelling is how Solana has completed a textbook market auction. Price rotated from a value area low near $95 to the point of control at $124.56, also a major support, and then advanced toward the value area high, now pressing into the supply zone at $178. This full rotation signals sustained strength and growing bullish conviction. This consolidation beneath resistance appears constructive rather than bearish. The consistent formation of higher lows indicates that buyers are stepping in earlier on each dip, often a precursor to a breakout. The apex zone forming between $175 and $178 points to a potential breakout in the very near term. You might also like: SUI vs. Coldware: Coldware disrupts web3 sphere, draws attention from SUI holders Volume remains subdued, which is typical in the final stages of a consolidation. The key signal to watch will be a spike in volume accompanying a move above $178. If that occurs, it would likely trigger a strong upward expansion toward the $241 resistance level. Solana’s historical reactions to key supply zones suggest that when price compresses under resistance while forming higher lows, breakouts tend to follow with strong momentum. This pattern has repeated across previous cycles, where SOL paused beneath resistance before rapidly breaking out. If the current setup mirrors past behavior, the next leg higher could not only reach $241 but also establish the foundation for further upside—especially if supported by broader market strength. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Solana holds above dynamic support near $175 and continues to press into $178, a breakout remains the most likely scenario. A move above this level on rising volume would likely send SOL surging toward $241, maintaining its bullish market structure.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding.

He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

We’re re-architecting everything,” said Donut founder and CEO Chris Zhu. “We’re reconstructing the front end of the internet to be hyper-financialized for AI agents.”  Donut closes $7 million pre-seed round. Source: DonutRelated: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin ‘premium’ nears $600K per BTCDonut’s users will gain access to an array of decentralized tools and crypto services under a single agentic interface, which could make digital asset transactions safer.“Architecturally isolated signing environments and AI-powered risk screening secure every transaction while optimizing execution for speed and cost,” said Zhu, adding that “AI translates opaque calldata into plain English and assigns safety grades.”Donut’s AI agents can trade or swap tokens, place bets, or earn passive yield on digital assets.Related: Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoptionAgentic browsers could reshape internet in next decadeWhile Donut’s earliest adopters will likely be crypto traders, builders or decentralized finance (DeFi) users, agentic browsers may explode into the mainstream during the next decade.Within the next five years, Ethereum layer-2 (L2) networks will use agentic browsers to cut settlement costs. Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

SOL/ETH weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April. Daily fees peaked in Q1 2025 but have since fallen to near-yearly lows, signaling reduced speculative activity on the chain, according to Dune Analytics.Pump.Fun fee and revenue chart.

Source: CoinMarketCapThe Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed.“It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.”On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers, levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10%.Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified.“The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, really — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said, “Buy everything round dos.”Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrowCrypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said, “So Trump tariffs are illegal? Does that mean we get green candles all around tomorrow?”Hundal said “a wall of money” is coming into Bitcoin through corporations, spot Bitcoin ETFs and retail.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

2025-05-28T22:20:00.000Z,"Ethereum bulls aim for $2.7K ahead of ETH’s $2.4B options expiry","Key takeaways:97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share. Ethereum no longer ranks among the top ten protocols in terms of fees, creating a supply imbalance that contributes to inflationary pressure on ETH.Sell (put) options ill-prepared for ETH prices above $2,600ETH options aggregate open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $2,300 and $2,500: $420 million in calls (buy) vs. $220 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $200 million.Between $2,500 and $2,600: $500 million calls vs. $130 million puts, favoring calls by $370 million.Between $2,600 and $2,700: $590 million calls vs. $35 million puts, favoring calls by $555 million.Between $2,700 and $2,900: $780 million calls vs. $10 million puts, favoring calls by $770 million.Bulls are strongly incentivized to push ETH past $2,700, yet the broader context may override those efforts. Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”“We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats,” said US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. The Labor Department under Biden criticized the practice of marketing cryptocurrencies to 401(k) participants. At the time, the agency claimed cryptocurrencies posed “significant risks and challenges” to participants’ retirement accounts due to their “speculative and volatile” nature and “valuation concerns,” among other reasons.The American Banking Association (ABA) criticized the 2022 compliance release, claiming that it did not make the guidance available for public comment and review prior to issuance.Related: Fidelity introduces retirement accounts with minimal-fee crypto investingTrump administration shifts crypto landscapePresident Trump has pledged to make the United States “the world capital of crypto” during his 2024 campaign.Under his administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has scaled back several enforcement actions and investigations involving Web3 companies such as Uniswap, Coinbase, and Kraken, while also engaging in policy discussions on topics like real-world asset tokenization and the regulatory status of certain tokens.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738.

Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61.On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA opens the gates for a rally to $2.65.

They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.

Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5.

This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast.

David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets. At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.”The FCA also noted it will work with the UK’s central bank to regulate stablecoins. Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said, “For those stablecoins that expect to operate at systemic scale, the Bank of England will publish a complementary consultation paper later this year.”Related: UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini reportEnsuring stablecoins remain stableThe FCA said that its rules “aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value.” The regulator said customers must be clearly informed about how the backing assets are managed. It also recommended that stablecoin issuers appoint independent third-party custodians to hold reserve assets:“We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency, irrespective of the value of the backing assets portfolio, with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.“Breeden added that the FCA’s proposals are part of a broader effort to build the UK’s stablecoin regime.Related: UK to require crypto firms to report every customer transactionCrypto custody rules incomingThe FCA’s proposals also introduce new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services, as outlined in a separate discussion paper. The rules are designed to ensure that user assets are secure and can be accessed at any time:“The FCA's proposals would require firms providing crypto custody services, who have responsibility for keeping consumers’ crypto safe, to ensure they are effectively secured and can be easily accessed at any time.“Proposed measures also aim to reduce both the likelihood and impact of crypto firms failing, both in the crypto custody and stablecoin sectors.

2025-05-28T13:19:41.000Z,"NFT monthly sales break 2025 downward trend in May: CryptoSlam","Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) caught an uptick in monthly sales in May after months of consistent decline throughout 2025. Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT monthly sales. Source: CointelegraphNFT sellers dwindle, while buyers increaseMay also showed a significant jump in unique buyers. The number of users buying NFTs rose by 50% to over 936,000 in May, up from around 622,000 in April.May’s figures are the largest buyer count since October 2024, hinting at growing investor participation during the month. While buyers increased, the number of unique sellers continued to decline. In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers.

The analyst believes real-world assets (RWAs) linking with NFTs could reignite the lending sector of digital collectibles. RWA NFTs also showed potential earlier this year.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart.
