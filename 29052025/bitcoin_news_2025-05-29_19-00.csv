According to a Bloomberg report , Banco Santander plans to offer cryptocurrency services to its retail clients, with the stablecoin initiative that’s still in the early stages of development another avenue through which the banking giant will strengthen its digital assets business. Sources told Bloomberg that Santander will target retail clients via Openbank, the Spanish bank’s digital banking platform that launched in the United States in October, 2024. Plans to expand its crypto business comes as the global banking community witnesses a significant surge in traction across the digital assets landscape.

Barclays Bank, Standard Chartered, and BBVA are among those exploring various crypto adoption strategies. Also making inroads at a rapid pace are Bank of America, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup. Standard Chartered recently strengthened its crypto footprint through a key partnership with crypto prime broker FalconX. The strategic partnership will see Standard Chartered offer its banking services to FalconX users. While still a crypto skeptic, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of U.S. banking and investment giant JPMorgan, recently said that the bank will allow its clients to buy Bitcoin ( BTC ), the world’s most popular and widely adopted digital asset. In January 2025, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick revealed that the bank was ready to work with U.S. regulators as it looks to expand its crypto involvement. The wealth management behemoth is eyeing crypto trading and was the first major bank in the U.S to bring Bitcoin funds to its high-net worth clients in 2021. Barclays Bank disclosed a $131 million investment in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Meanwhile, Santander’s crypto and blockchain traction includes asset tokenization and crypto custody services.

2025-05-29T16:55:00.000Z,"JPMorgan Chase Fined $566,082 for Allegedly Failing To Respond to Regulator During Energy Crisis","France’s energy regulator is penalizing the German unit of global financial services firm JPMorgan Chase for failing to provide sufficient information to a power market survey related to soaring electricity prices. In a statement, the French Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) says it sought to question 44 market participants to understand the causes of the unprecedented increase in electricity prices, which spiked in 2022. The CRE says that 43 participants responded to requests for information, but J.P. Morgan SE (JPMSE) refused to share some information, particularly those related to the identity of the company’s counterparties and customers that engaged in transactions related to the subject of the survey. JPMSE reasoned that the French regulator does not have the power to make binding requests to market players based in other European Union member states. In response, the CRE says it conducted an investigation and found the firm violated a law that entitles the regulator to collect information from companies operating in the French electricity market. The CRE’s Disputes and Sanctions Settlement Committee (CoRDiS) is now sanctioning JMPSE with a €500,000 ($567,500) fine. “This is the first decision of the CoRDiS concerning a breach of the obligation to communicate information necessary for the fulfillment of the CRE’s missions.” At time of publishing, JPMorgan Chase has not issued a public comment addressing the fine.

While most altcoins have continued their rise since the mid-April market bottom, Shiba Inu has been sidelined in the “best crypto to buy” conversation, falling over 20% throughout May. Data from Santiment shows that the Shiba Inu supply on exchanges has increased from 139 trillion to $141 trillion over the past month in what appears to be a new uptrend. SHIB supply on exchanges through May. Source: Santiment. With fewer traders adopting a HODL strategy, the SHIB price may be subject to higher levels of volatility as more turn to short-term speculative trading. SHIB Price Analysis: What Do These Traders Know? This strategy shift comes amid a bearish flag pattern, developing since the mid-April market bottom—a potential brief pause before the bearish momentum continues. SHIB / USDT 1-week chart, bearish flag pattern. Source: TradingView / Binance. The month-long price decline has pushed a retest of the pattern’s lower support, a key level that could give way to a pattern breakdown. If breached, SHIB risks a 60% decline to the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $0.0000058, potentially wiping out all of its 2024 gains. Momentum indicators currently hang in the balance. The RSI trends sideways just below the neutral 50 mark at 46—sellers dominate, but not decisively. The MACD also widens its lead above the signal line after a recent golden cross, although only marginally, it supports the formation of a longer-term uptrend despite short-term bearishness. In the near term, the 0.618 Fib level at $0.000013 is a key support to watch. A strong bounce could send the SHIB price up 35%, back toward the flag’s upper resistance around $0.00002, invalidating the pattern if it breaks out above. Bullish Sentiment is Returning – Here’s How to Take Advantage Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin as a major part of their portfolio, especially as “safe-haven” assets like gold and BTC continue to outperform altcoins. But, while Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting highs of $1M this cycle and BTC finally back on the recovery path, $BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $6.5 million raised in its ongoing presale , the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially due to its 62% APY on staking that rewards early investors for holding. You can keep up with Bitcoin Bull on X and Telegram . To buy $BTCBULL and benefit from its rising momentum, visit the official Bitcoin Bull website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can invest using crypto or a bank card.

2025-05-29T16:39:54.000Z,"Saudi Prince: We Are Long-Term XRP Holders","In a powerful revelation that underscores the deepening global confidence in XRP, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud has publicly confirmed that his family has been a long-term holder of the digital asset. The news, highlighted by Vandell of Black Swan Capitalist on X, comes on the heels of a monumental $121 million investment led by the prince to transform VivoPower International PLC, a Nasdaq-listed company, into the world’s first XRP-focused digital asset firm. For years, Vandell and analyst Versan have referenced the Saudi royal family’s quiet interest in XRP, but this announcement marks the first time that connection has been confirmed so openly. The recent investment signals a pivotal moment not just for VivoPower but for XRP’s institutional trajectory on the global stage. Remember the Saudi royal family, Prince & XRP? Something Versan & I mentioned a few times for years. Well, Prince Abdulaziz led a $121M investment to transform VivoPower, a public company, into the first XRP-focused digital asset firm. They've officially announced their… — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) May 29, 2025 Transforming VivoPower Into an XRP Powerhouse The investment led by Prince Abdulaziz will establish a dedicated XRP-based digital asset treasury within VivoPower. This bold strategy positions the company as a trailblazer among publicly traded firms, mirroring the high-profile Bitcoin treasury model pioneered by Strategy, but with a focused bet on XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. In a formal statement, Prince Abdulaziz emphasized his family’s decade-long involvement in the digital asset space and, more specifically, their steadfast commitment to XRP. He explained that after assessing several public companies seeking to adopt a digital asset treasury model, VivoPower was chosen due to its targeted approach toward XRP and its clear mission to advance the XRPL ecosystem. A Decade of Royal Confidence in XRP Prince Abdulaziz’s remarks provide rare insight into the Saudi royal family’s investment philosophy regarding cryptocurrencies. While many global investors have focused on Bitcoin or Ethereum, the prince’s team has maintained a long-term XRP position, viewing the asset as uniquely positioned for real-world financial applications, particularly cross-border payments. This decade of quiet accumulation and strategic patience now aligns with VivoPower’s transformation, reinforcing the prince’s belief that the time is ripe to expand XRP’s global presence and leverage its network capabilities at scale. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Wave Builds Around XRP The prince’s backing of VivoPower reflects a growing institutional wave of interest in XRP that has gained momentum throughout 2025. Earlier this year, companies like Wellgistics Health announced plans to adopt XRP as part of their reserve asset strategies, while firms such as Worksport have explored similar moves. With Prince Abdulaziz’s formal involvement, the signal to global markets is clear: XRP is increasingly seen not just as a speculative token but as an institutional-grade asset with tangible utility. This high-profile endorsement from a Saudi royal amplifies XRP’s credibility in global finance circles, particularly in the Middle East, where sovereign wealth and state-backed capital could further accelerate adoption. XRP’s Future Shines Bright As XRP’s institutional story unfolds, Prince Abdulaziz’s bold statement reinforces the digital asset’s staying power and potential. The prince’s vision to use VivoPower as a vehicle to expand the XRPL ecosystem underscores the maturing landscape of blockchain finance and the pivotal role XRP aims to play in it. With royal backing, strategic alignment, and growing institutional conviction, XRP is poised to continue its evolution from a cross-border payments solution to a core building block in the next generation of financial infrastructure. As Vandell from Black Swan Capitalist rightly noted, the Saudi royal connection is no longer just speculation; it’s now front and center, marking a defining moment in XRP’s global journey.

2025-05-29T16:39:23.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Russia’s Banks Ignite Bitcoin Adoption","Russia’s central bank just flipped the regulatory script, granting a green light for licensed banks to package crypto-based instruments exclusively for accredited investors. This move marks a significant thaw in Moscow’s stance, and is the extension of a previous proposal that involved wealthy individuals being allowed to invest in crypto . By allowing derivatives, securities and other digital financial assets tied to Bitcoin under a legal umbrella, the Bank of Russia is setting a precedent that could ripple across global markets. As accredited clients gain carbon‑copy access to crypto exposure without wrestling with wallets or exchanges, savvy traders are already eyeing the shifting landscape. For investors scouting opportunity, this latest development underscores why it’s time to pinpoint the best crypto to buy now. The Ruble Route to Bitcoin: How Russia Is Reinventing Crypto Access Russian regulators have quietly handed banks the keys to a fresh suite of crypto products for accredited investors, while emphatically barring any outright delivery of tokens. On May 28, the Bank of Russia confirmed that qualified institutions can now launch derivatives, securities and other digital financial assets pegged to crypto prices, but not handle actual coin transfers. At the same time, public data revealed a 51% surge in resident crypto inflows during Q1 2025—an eye‑popping 7.3 trillion rubles ($81.5 billion). On the heels of the policy shift, T‑Bank (formerly Tinkoff) wasted no time, rolling out its own Bitcoin‑linked \""smart assets\"" through the state‑backed Atomyze platform on May 29. Users can now play the market in rubles via a familiar app interface—no exchange account or wallet management needed. True, the central bank still advises against direct crypto ownership. Yet discussions are underway for an experimental regime to let certain investors trade assets like Bitcoin outright. The latest financial stability review pegs Russians’ centralized exchange holdings at 827 billion rubles ($9.2 billion), with Bitcoin commanding a 62% share, Ether at 22% and stablecoins like USDT and USDC at roughly 16%. On the flip side, industry insiders argue that this figure barely scratches the surface—some believe actual holdings on personal wallets and decentralized venues run far higher, a claim underlined by Exved founder Sergey Mendeleev’s cheeky nod to hefty private balances. Best Crypto To Buy Now With banks primed to offer regulated crypto exposure and a dramatic uptick in inflows, the institutional undercurrent is shifting in favor of established and emerging tokens alike. As the search for the best crypto to buy now intensifies, and regulations loosen while new products hit the market, investors would do well to zero in on momentum leaders. BTC Bull Riding the wave of bank‑sponsored exposure, BTC Bull token amplifies Bitcoin’s gains with builtin leverage. It’s tailor‑made for traders seeking turbocharged returns as traditional institutions warm up to crypto. The $BTCBULL token captures Bitcoin's upside while rewarding holders with real BTC at price milestones.

Rewards trigger at Bitcoin's first new high ($150k) and every $50k climb thereafter, creating recurring incentives. Bitcoin trades above its 2025 peak, yet institutional money keeps flowing in steadily. The floodgates are opening, signaling sustained interest even at elevated price levels. At $125K BTC, BTCBULL will trigger its first token burn. 🔥Less supply. Same hype. The charge is on! 🐂 pic.twitter.com/O218IzuwsE — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 27, 2025 $BTCBULL combines passive Bitcoin rewards with a deflationary token model. It targets investors seeking leveraged Bitcoin exposure plus altcoin growth potential within one asset.

The stakes? If Solana’s rally continues, Solaxy could become essential. Its success hinges on solving congestion just as Solana approaches its breaking point. According to popular crypto YouTuber 99Bitcoins , Solaxy has massive potential to deliver parabolic returns. Snorter Snorter’s dynamic yield strategy and community‑driven governance make it the dark horse in a regulated landscape. Think of it as the maverick that flips market conventions on their head.

It’s like a digital bloodhound, sniffing out value fast. Bitcoin Bitcoin, the blue-chip backbone of any crypto portfolio, remains the undisputed pioneer of digital assets.Now backed by bank-certified instruments, its dominance has never been more firmly endorsed by institutions worldwide. Often called “digital gold,” the asset introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto continues to make headlines—not just for breaking price resistance, but for reshaping global financial strategies. One such shift came as Pakistan launched its first government-backed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a major leap into the world of digital finance. The announcement was made by Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, during his keynote at Bitcoin Vegas 2025 in Las Vegas. Addressing a high-profile audience that included the U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump, and Donald Trump Jr., Saqib positioned Bitcoin as a path to financial freedom. He emphasized Pakistan’s intent to emerge as a serious player in the global crypto space, using blockchain to drive innovation and economic resilience. JD Vance echoed this optimism, urging the U.S. to lead the digital currency race, especially as China remains cautious on Bitcoin.He predicted Bitcoin would hold strategic value in U.S. policy for the next decade. In technical terms, it is currently trading at around $108,601 with a market cap of $2.15 trillion, positioning it in 1st place. However, over the past 24 hours, it has been declining, creating an opportunity for potential buyers to benefit from the dip. Meanwhile, Trump Media unveiled a $2.5 billion plan to build a Bitcoin treasury, placing cryptocurrency at the heart of its financial future. Conclusion This landmark decision by the Bank of Russia doesn’t just tweak rules—it accelerates crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. By opening the door for banks to tailor crypto instruments, regulators have signaled a broader trend toward institutional embrace and regulatory maturation. For accredited investors, it translates to safer entry points and diverse exposure methods. Looking ahead, this evolution could set a template for other markets while nudging token innovation into overdrive. As ever, measured strategy trumps blind speculation—focus on quality projects with robust fundamentals. After all, when the stakes are high, one wants the best crypto to buy now.

2025-05-29T16:30:31.000Z,"$400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’","Bitcoin has been trading in a tight band lately. Over the last 24 hours it dipped a bit, but it still sits between $108,000 and $110,000. According to market data, that range has held firm even as volatility showed up back in January and April. Related Reading: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO Lagging Money Supply Signal According to analyst Kyle Chassé, Bitcoin’s price tends to follow global M2 money supply with a 90-day lag. He matched daily closes on the Bitstamp exchange against world M2 data shifted three months back. That overlay shows that when global liquidity climbs, Bitcoin often rises after roughly 90 days. Short-Term Price Moves Bitcoin first spiked above $109,000 this past January. Then it fell below $75,000 in early April. Since that dip, it’s climbed back toward the $110,000 mark. Based on the lagged money-supply trend, it feels like a pause in a bigger up-and-down cycle rather than the end of a rally. Growing Money Figures Global M2 stood at about $98 trillion in early 2023. It rose to just over $108 trillion by early 2024. Then growth slowed, and Bitcoin spent some time below $80,000. Lately, M2 is past $111 trillion. Based on those numbers, reports say Bitcoin’s upside could stretch into mid-2025 as liquidity stays strong. Bitcoin is coded to $400K. pic.twitter.com/6BbogYw1UX — Kyle Chassé / DD🐸 (@kyle_chasse) May 27, 2025 Bullish Price Targets Chassé projects Bitcoin may hit $400,000 if global M2 keeps growing. It is “coded“, he says. That means roughly a 270% jump from the current $108,000 level. Based on this model, investors watching liquidity trends might see big gains, though it won’t be smooth. Other experts point out that money supply isn’t the only driver. Real interest rates, policy shifts and on-chain signals can speed up or slow down moves. If central banks turn hawkish, for example, higher rates could undercut Bitcoin even if M2 ticks up. Related Reading: $10 Million Fix? SUI Network Moves Fast After Cetus Exploit Scare What Comes Next Based on reports from Global Macro Investor, global M2 leads Bitcoin by about 12 weeks. That gives traders a rough timetable. If M2 growth really slows in coming months, Bitcoin may hold its ground or correct first. On the flip side, any fresh liquidity surge could set the stage for new highs. In the end, the link between money supply and Bitcoin price is a useful guide. It won’t tell you exactly when to buy or sell. But for anyone tracking big-picture trends, knowing that cash growth can flow into crypto after a three-month delay could help time decisions better.

Irdeto says that the collaboration will improve its Cyber Services, especially the Payment Disruption service. The team finds and removes threat actors that utilize crypto platforms to fund illicit activities. Per the press release, Irdeto provides Coinbase with comprehensive investigative reports to help them identify and remove bad actors. “This disrupts the criminals’ ability to receive payments for illegal services and halts their progression into more serious forms of cybercrime,” it argues. Lately, we have observed a rather concerning trend in the increasing use of cryptocurrency to finance illicit activities, which is why we are excited to announce our strategic partnership with Coinbase. Learn more in our press release: https://t.co/MvpXuSckeV pic.twitter.com/Wrcg7eMMi4 — Irdeto (@Irdeto) May 29, 2025 Furthermore, Irdeto plans to leverage the collaboration to expand its investigation scope, given the increase in the use of crypto as payments for services or profit laundering by gangs. Additionally, the Cyber Services team also supports clients in reporting illegal activities and bad actors to law enforcement. This way, they help identify the crypto address owners, advance investigations, find and arrest offenders, build prosecution cases, and support the seizure and recovery of illicit crypto assets. The partnership “empowering us to remove financial lifelines from pirates and cheat developers before they can scale their operations,” said Mark Mulready, Vice President of Cyber Services at Irdeto. “This is a powerful example of how strategic industry collaboration can disrupt criminal infrastructure and protect the digital ecosystem.” You may also like: $200M Crypto Seized as DOJ Nabs 270 Suspects in Record Darknet Takedown On May 22, the DOJ cracked the dark web's code. 270 suspects were arrested—$200M in crypto and cash seized, as authorities delivered a crushing blow to the darknet’s economy.The operation, dubbed SpecTor, marks the largest darknet takedown ever, spanning nine countries and exposing crypto’s role as both a weapon and a weak spot for criminals.https://twitter.com/DOJCrimDiv/status/1925584597875621916Why Crypto Anonymity Isn’t as Untouchable as Criminals ThinkAttorney... Cutting Cybercrime Infra at Source Irdeto’s investigations found that threat actors across the video entertainment and gaming ecosystems utilize crypto increasingly for illegal activities. The team has shared what it’s described as “a concerning trend.” Namely, the use of crypto by illicit service providers jumped from 13% in 2022 to 17% in 2023, and then to 19% by the end of 2024. Therefore, the new partnership aims to disrupt cybercriminal infrastructure at the source, it says. Irdeto is “committed to not only detecting threats but actively dismantling the infrastructure that supports them,” added Mulready. The company will also continue working closely with digital transaction providers and law enforcement agencies globally. He added that partnerships, like the one with Coinbase, enhance the Payment Disruption service, thus helping to combat cybercrime across industries. Therefore, it’s actively signing more partnerships with crypto platforms. This will boost its ability to track crypto usage in illicit markets and remove critical financial enablers. \""The ultimate vision for crypto has always been economic freedom.\"" – @brian_armstrong , co-founder of @coinbase \""The mission of Coinbase is to increase economic freedom in the world.

A few days later, the US Justice Department (DOJ) opened an investigation into the security breach. In response to the incident, Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal stated that “we have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors.” On 25 May, investors filed a class action lawsuit , alleging that the exchange failed to promptly disclose a serious data breach and a regulatory violation, and that these contributed to a drop in stock price.

2025-05-29T16:17:28.000Z,"Bitcoin DeFi Explodes: Bull Run Locks 2,000 BTC – Is $115K Next?","Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on a bullish trajectory. The cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 before quickly retracting to $110,700. The price of BTC is currently hovering around $108,000, yet metrics suggest that Bitcoin is on an upward trend. Bitcoin bulls predict that the price of BTC may soon rally to $115,000. Bitcoin just hit new All time high of $111,700 and $BTC balance on exchanges hit new all time low. Supply shock is coming and that will send Bitcoin to $200k+ sooner than you think. pic.twitter.com/b9nEiXMUln — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 22, 2025 Bull Run Advances Bitcoin DeFi While investors eagerly await another BTC all-time high, industry experts point out that this bull run is different from previous cycles. Rena Shah, chief operating officer of Trust Machines, told Cryptonews that the recent Bitcoin all-time high has a different momentum compared to the first time BTC went above $100k. According to Shah, the current Bitcoin bull run is advancing Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) in new ways. For instance, Shah noted that a considerable amount of BTC has recently been locked into sBTC , a 1:1 bitcoin-backed asset secured via the Stacks blockchain. “The Bitcoin ecosystem has seen more and more BTC bridged, with more than 2,000 BTC recently being locked in Stacks sBTC ,” Shah said. “As more users look at the earning opportunities available without selling their Bitcoin, we’ll see a positive surge of building on Bitcoin follow.” sBTC Cap-3 officially filled in just a few hours, with over 5,000 BTC now made productive on the leading Bitcoin L2, Stacks. That’s over $500M in Bitcoin put to work. Stacks' momentum keeps rising. pic.twitter.com/ZyhrDa0p8f — stacks.btc (@Stacks) May 22, 2025 Echoing this, Matt Mudano, co-founder and CEO of Arch Network, told Cryptonews that Bitcoin is no longer just being held by investors. “In past cycles, the price of BTC surged primarily from speculation and accumulation. But this time, we’re seeing infrastructure mature to actually make Bitcoin productive,” he said. Mudano attributes this to the rise of Bitcoin layer-2 (L2) networks , along with native smart contract layers such as Arch. He further noted that BTC-backed stablecoins continue to unlock new use cases like lending, structured products, and DeFi built around Bitcoin. “That’s why we’re seeing more BTC bridged, wrapped, or integrated—not because people want to leave Bitcoin, but because they want to do more with it,” Mudano said. “The $100K narrative isn’t just about scarcity anymore—it’s about utility.” Bitcoin Becomes Active Capital New use cases demonstrate how Bitcoin is evolving from a passive store-of-value to a form of active capital in the digital economy. Mudano pointed out that previously, the only way for users to earn on BTC was to borrow against it or wrap it into Ethereum-based systems. However, these models come with risks such as liquidations, custodial exposure, or exiting from the Bitcoin trust model. In order to combat these challenges, Mudano explained that Arch allows users to earn yield without selling or borrowing against their BTC. This is accomplished by lending out BTC to protocols that deploy the asset into low-risk structured products or credit strategies. “Users can provide liquidity to Bitcoin-native decentralized exchanges and perp markets to earn fees from real economic activity,” he said. “Yield is now driven by actual demand, or the need to use BTC as capital in an on-chain economy, just like ETH became valuable by underpinning DeFi.” Just like Ethereum’s yield came from being the base layer of on-chain finance, Mudano believes that Bitcoin is finally entering that same phase, making this cycle vastly different from other bull runs. Shah agrees that Bitcoin is an asset that should be used as collateral. She explained that sBTC unlocks Bitcoin DeFi by allowing users to earn yield, access on-chain lending, and trade on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) . For example, protocols like Granite create the opportunity to lend and borrow against Bitcoin without ever having to sell. Launched in September 2024, Granite was incubated by Trust Machines and lets users access DeFi by leveraging Stacks’ recently launched Nakamoto upgrade and sBTC Bitcoin bridge . Willem Schroe, founder of Bitcoin L2 Botanix, told Cryptonews that Botanix also allows BTC holders to earn without selling their Bitcoin. Schroe believes this trend is gaining momentum in the current bull market. “This cycle, we’re seeing these use cases go from experimental to real. Live on testnet and soon to launch mainnet in mid-June, we’re already seeing users use pUSD, borrow against BTC, and engage with early DeFi protocols building on top of us,” Schroe commented. Palladium Labs bridges Bitcoin’s unmatched security with the flexibility of Web3 by introducing PUSD—a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin that operates without centralized control. @PalladiumLabs pic.twitter.com/U5Ckg9DTIW — Miki.base.eth (@Stanos126) May 29, 2025 To put this in perspective, Schroe explained that Botanix users can borrow against their BTC. The process involves locking up the asset and then minting a stablecoin like Palladium pUSD ( pUSD ) on Botanix. This provides liquidity without triggering a taxable event or exiting your position. Building on Bitcoin Surges Not only are more people across ecosystems getting interested in using Bitcoin for DeFi, but Bitcoiners who’ve long held their BTC dormant are getting involved in various innovations. “Momentum always follows capital—and for the first time, we have both flowing into Bitcoin. Past bull runs made people rich off Bitcoin. This one is about building with Bitcoin,” Mudano said. According to Mudano, several factors are currently converging that allow Bitcoin holders to do more this cycle. “Ordinals and Runes activity brought a wave of developer interest, but new infrastructure like Arch, Stacks, and others are making Bitcoin programmable without compromising its principles,” he said. At the same time, Mudano noted that capital markets are finally paying attention to digital assets. “ETFs, institutional strategies, and the realization that BTC can underpin a real financial system is all being seen now,” he said. Mudano further believes that while the current bull market may pump the price of BTC, the infrastructure wave is turning the narrative into a builder’s cycle. Shah agrees, as she pointed out that Stacks recently announced an entirely new roadmap, along with the launch of SIP-031 . Both of these developments demonstrate a more robust and competitive ecosystem around building on Bitcoin. Challenges To Consider While it’s clear that the current bull run is advancing Bitcoin DeFi, a number of challenges remain. For example, Mudano believes that the biggest factor holding back Bitcoin DeFi today is also what makes Bitcoin so powerful—its decentralization. “There’s no foundation, no core team, no steering committee to dictate how the chain should evolve,” he said. “That means there’s no single roadmap to scaling or programmability. Instead, it’s up to builders—independent teams like ours—to experiment, innovate, and push the boundaries of what’s possible within Bitcoin’s constraints.” Mudano added that the Bitcoin ecosystem is currently witnessing a wave of experimentation, ranging from covenants, to ZK-rollups , to threshold multisig and custom virtual machines. Schroe further noted that a lack of native programmability may hold Bitcoin DeFi back. “Bitcoin wasn’t designed for complex smart contracts,” he said. “Bitcoin-based blockchains like Botanix solve this by introducing Ethereum virtual machine compatibility while still anchoring to Bitcoin for settlement.” In addition, skepticism from Bitcoin purists has also created challenges. Schroe pointed out that these people often doubt the security and other aspects associated with Bitcoin DeFi. “Ultimately, the antidote is education and execution. The more users see how they can earn from BTC in a non-custodial, Bitcoin-native way, the faster adoption will follow,” he commented.

The Hedera Foundation, which supports the development of the Hedera ( HBAR ) blockchain network, revealed the huge news on May 29, 2025, noting in a blog post that its partnership with StegX will see the real estate platform deploy more than $100 million in real estate tokens on Hedera. The partnership also involves Zoniqx, a Silicon Valley-based firm focused on bridging real-world assets to the decentralized finance ecosystem via compliant and interoperable blockchain infrastructure. Zoniqx’s Dynamic Compliant Interoperable Security Token, or DyCIST, is the standard for ERC-7518 aimed at institutional tokenization. Zoniqx’s standard allows for the embedding of jurisdiction-aware compliance at the token layer, as well as the automation of know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering enforcement. KYC and AML are key compliance requirements that have slowed institutional entry into the tokenized real-world asset market. You might also like: Solv launches RWA-backed Bitcoin yield product StegX’s deployment of the tokens will leverage the security token standard ERC-7518, with this allowing the platform to tokenize regulated assets. Hedera Foundation said the platform’s move is one that “shifts tokenization from theory to execution.” “By integrating the ERC-7518 token standard on the Hedera network, the StegX marketplace is not only pioneering a new era of asset tokenization but also ensuring that every transaction is executed according to the regulations of the issuers,” said Daniel Radwansky, chief executive officer and co-founder of StegX. “Our partnership with Zoniqx fortifies this vision, providing a fully digital and compliant pathway for institutional investors to access premium tokenized real-world assets,” Radwansky added. The Hedera Foundation’s collaboration with StegX and Zoniqx comes just a day after Verra, a global carbon standard leader with over 1 billion carbon credits issued, integrated with Hedera. Verra accounts for over 60% of the global carbon credits market. The HBAR Foundation also recently partnered with asset tokenization platform Tokeny as it looks to bring compliant real-world asset tokenization to the Hedera network. In February, the HBAR Foundation invested in Fidelity International’s money market fund, with the shares tokenized by Archax.

2025-05-29T16:12:38.000Z,"Three reasons why the soaring SPX crypto token could crash soon","The SPX6900 token has been in a strong uptrend since March, making it one of the top gainers in crypto. SPX6900 ( SPX ) price jumped to a high of $1.222 on May 29, the highest point since January. It has soared by almost 350% from its March low, bringing its valuation to over $1 billion. It is now the eighth-largest meme coin in the crypto industry. SPX6900 has surged due to fear of missing out among investors, driving its total number of holders to 40,000 from 29,000 on January 1. This FOMO is also reflected in the rising number of social media mentions. While SPX has flipped the key resistance level at $1, there are several fundamental and technical reasons why it may crash in the coming days or weeks. First, Santiment data shows that the supply of SPX tokens on exchanges has continued to rise this month. There are now 87 million tokens on exchanges, up from the January low of 41 million. Nansen reports the exchange supply at 141 million, a 6.5% monthly increase.

Holders with between 1 million and 10 million tokens now hold 300 million SPX6900 coins, down from 330 million last month. Similarly, those holding between 100 million and 1 billion tokens have reduced their holdings to 148 million from April’s 163 million. SPX whale transactions | Source: Santiment Additional Nansen data shows that smart money investors now hold 4.6 million SPX coins, a 10% monthly decline. Their holdings have dropped to a record low, indicating that they expect further downside. SPX price technical analysis SPX6900 price chart | Source: crypto.news A final technical reason SPX may decline is the formation of a rising wedge pattern on the 12-hour chart. The lower trendline connects the lowest swings since May 7, while the upper trendline links the highest swings since April 14. These two lines are now nearing a confluence point, which could result in a strong bearish breakdown in the coming days. If that occurs, the first support level to watch is $1.00, followed by $0.6383, the lowest swing on May 18.

Nigel Farage is betting big on crypto. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, the Reform UK leader will announce a bold legislative proposal to make Britain a “crypto powerhouse” — a move aimed squarely at younger voters and digital asset enthusiasts, according to Bloomberg reporting . The bill, which Farage says is ready to be introduced if his party wins power, includes slashing capital gains tax on crypto investments from 24% to 10%, creating a two-year regulatory sandbox for crypto firms in the City of London, and banning financial discrimination against crypto users. Reform says this is the first fully drafted bill it has released, signaling the party’s intent to broaden its policy credentials ahead of the next general election. You might also like: Solana compresses near resistance, breakout to $241 likely if confirmed Following Donald Trump’s lead? Farage’s initiative mirrors U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent pro-crypto pivot . Trump has embraced digital assets to energize younger voters, with his son Eric recently declaring support for Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a way to disrupt the traditional banking system. Farage, a longtime ally of Trump, appears to be following the same playbook — framing crypto as a form of financial self-sovereignty and rebellion against central control. Farage’s crypto past includes promoting digital assets through a now-defunct investment newsletter, and he’s been vocal in opposing central bank digital currencies like the Bank of England’s proposed “Britcoin.” He calls Bitcoin a “peaceful revolt” against inflation and surveillance, per Bloomberg. Labour leader Keir Starmer criticized the move Thursday, likening Farage’s platform to the failed economic policies of Liz Truss. Still, Reform UK is gaining traction in the polls and outperformed Labour in recent local elections. The party will present the full bill to journalists Friday morning in London, marking its most serious policy rollout yet.

A young Russian couple involved in crypto was kidnapped by Chechens and forced to pay $43,000 in crypto as ransom, Argentine media reported on Thursday, May 28. The couple, who were running a crypto business, was kidnapped on Friday in the Palermo district of Buenos Aires. According to investigators, the couple was invited to a dinner by two Chechens. Around 11 PM local time, the 30-year-old woman was calling for help from the balcony. After that, employees at a nearby restaurant called the police, who soon arrived at the scene. At the scene, the police found the woman and her 27-year-old partner, who was tied up. The couple recounted that the Checkens made them send $43,000 in crypto to an associate’s wallet address before fleeing the scene.

After the Meeting with Trump, a $121 Million Move Came from the Giant Company!","While the Bitcoin (BTC) reserve strategy was generally adopted under the leadership of the big bull Michael Saylor's company Strategy, a huge Ripple (XRP) move came from a Nasdaq-listed company. VivoPower, an energy company founded in 2014, has raised $121 million to launch the XRP treasury strategy, Coindesk reported. The funds raised will be used to purchase XRP, set up XRP-focused treasury operations, contribute to the XRPL DeFi ecosystem, and for debt reduction and working capital. “…XRP is expected to be one of five digital assets to be deposited by the U.S. Government as part of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile that President Donald Trump recently announced.” What makes the company's XRP strategy interesting is that the financing was led by Saudi Arabian Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud, who has long invested in digital assets and XRP. Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud said: “We have been investors in the digital asset industry for ten years and are long-term holders of XRP. After reviewing a number of listed brokers looking to adopt the digital asset treasury model, we selected VivoPower due to its strategic focus on XRP and its goal of contributing to the creation of the XRPL ecosystem. “We are honored to lead this capital raise for a company that will be the first in the world to implement an XRP-focused treasury strategy.” The Saudi prince also said his team met with US President Donald Trump and his leadership group during his recent visit to Saudi Arabia. At this point, the talks seem to play an important role in accelerating the XRP-focused treasury strategy plans. Former Ripple board member and SBI Ripple Asia CEO Adam Traidman is also among the investors, and he will also serve as the chairman of VivoPower’s advisory board. VivoPower reportedly became the first public company to adopt the XRP treasury strategy with this move. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Another First for XRP!

Price action reveals a wedge pattern with a tightening range, underlined by Fibonacci retracements. BTC struggles to hold above the 0.236 retracement at $109,661, with the MACD flipping bearish and the 50-EMA at $108,504 acting as immediate resistance. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A sustained break below $107,000 may lead to $105,905 and $104,256, while a bounce above $108,504 could open the path back to $109,634 and $111,935. Traders might consider shorting below $107,000 with stops above $108,504 or buying on a clear break above $108,504 for a run toward $109,600 and higher.

While TRUMP remains down 19% in the past week and 9% over the past month — and still 73% below its all-time high of $73.43 — recent developments suggest a potential reversal. Trump Media’s alleged plan to raise $2.5 billion to stockpile Bitcoin (BTC) has reignited speculative interest, helping daily trading volumes climb back to $500 million. If this momentum builds, the Trump Coin price could be preparing for a recovery — with analysts watching key levels in their latest Trump Coin price prediction . Trump Coin Price Prediction: $500M Flood Suggests Political Catalyst Could Be Days Away TRUMP’s chart today indicates that the token may actually drop further in the next few days, before rebounding at some point next week. Its indicators show a loss of momentum this week, with its 30-period average (orange) about to fall below the 200-period average (blue), forming a ‘death cross’ that can signal further losses or even a big dump. Source: TradingView At the same time, TRUMP’s relative strength index (purple) has fallen from nearly 70 last week to 40 today, and its trajectory is still downwards. It will therefore be interesting to see whether its current support level (green) can prevent further losses in the near term, although a slight rise in trading volume today does appear to hold out hope of a quick turnaround. Volume has risen just above $500 million, suggesting a lift in demand, potentially as insiders or other large traders buy more of the coin in anticipation of some positive Trump-related news. However, to put things in some context, TRUMP’s trading volume was as high as $2.2 billion a week ago, as traders bought the coin ahead of the official dinner for token holders .

Yet this may change in the future, since as the gradual expansion of the Trump crypto empire may only be a good thing for the Trump Coin price. The second half of the year could therefore be very bullish for TRUMP, which could reach $20 by Q3, and then $50 by Q4. New Tokens With Strong Utility and Potential If TRUMP is a little too risky for some traders, they may prefer to invest in newer coins with more utility. Utility is not something that every or even most new alts have, but there are some recent examples of new coins that are showing real promise. One of these is Snorter (SNORT), a Solana- and Ethereum-based token that comes with its own helpful trading bot. Snorter has only just opened the presale for SNORT, yet it has already raised in excess of $150,000, an early sign of how big it could become. What sets Snorter part from existing trading bots is that it has been designed specifically for sniping, so that investors can trade ahead of the market and potentially make bigger profits. As such, it will enable automated trades, limit orders, MEV-resistant token swaps, copy trading, and protection against rugpulls. It’s highly comprehensive and efficient, with the SNORT token providing numerous benefits to holders, including lower fees, higher staking yields and community rewards. While its presale has only just begun, interest investors should act quickly, since its presale price will rise every few days. They can join SNORT’s sale at the Snorter website , where the token currently costs $0.0935.

2025-05-29T15:32:42.000Z,"Crypto wrap May 29: BTC holds $108K, ETH surge helps ARB, EIGEN higher","The cryptocurrency market showed a largely risk-on outlook on May 29, 2025, with altcoins trading higher as the global market cap rose to $3.44 trillion and volume spiked 6% to over $129 billion. Amid this, Bitcoin (BTC) remained near its all-time highs, trading above $108,770. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) led the altcoin charge with a notable 3% surge in 24 hours to hit highs above $2,700. This upward momentum in ETH notably sparked gains in related altcoins like Arbitrum (ARB) and EigenLayer (EIGEN). Bitcoin price steady amid tariff news On May 29, 2025, the price of Bitcoin saw a slight uptick on Thursday, trading above $108,700 after dipping to lows of $106k on May 28. BTC held at the crucial level as the crypto market turned bullish following a US court’s decision to block President Donald Trump’s tariffs. This and institutional demand for BTC, with Japan-based Metaplanet raising $21 million to bolster its Bitcoin holdings, has helped the benchmark crypto asset hold steady. Other news that has added to bullish sentiment includes GameStop’s headline acquisition of 4,710 BTC and inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum price jumps above $2,700 Ethereum surged Thursday morning, briefly trading above $2,770 and extending its rally that began in early May when it broke out from below $1,800. The move marks a gain of over 48% in the past 30 days. Analysts say ETH is likely to consolidate above the $2,700 level in the near term, with fresh momentum potentially driving the price to $3,300. The key short-term target remains $4,000, a level that could come into view if bullish sentiment persists and market conditions remain favorable. “$ETH is finally pumping,” crypto analyst Lark Davis posted on X, suggesting this spike could trigger an altcoin rally.

You know what’s coming next. 5:17 pm · 29 May 2025 293 Reply Copy link Read 99 replies ARB, EIGEN among top gainers as ETH surges Ethereum’s rally has lifted several related altcoins, with Arbitrum (ARB), EigenLayer (EIGEN), and Lido DAO (LDO) posting impressive gains. ARB, the token of Arbitrum, spiked nearly 10% before paring gains. The upside has largely benefited from network developments and optimism around Ethereum’s ecosystem. EIGEN, tied to EigenLayer’s restaking protocol, jumped 12% in 24 hours and 18% over the week. The uptick reflects increased interest in Ethereum’s layer-2 and DeFi market. Lido DAO (LDO), a liquid staking protocol, rose 8% in the last 24 hours and 14% over the past week. Which altcoins are top gainers today? Among other top gainers, Zeebec Network (ZBC) gained 32%, Status (SNT) rose 25%, and SPX6900 (SPX) surged 22%. On the downside, Sophon (SOPH) dropped 24%, and NEXPACE (NXPC) was down 12%.

2025-05-29T15:26:42.000Z,"Analyst Predicts $3K Ethereum (ETH) Milestone in June","Ethereum (ETH) is flashing bullish signals, prompting prominent market watchers to predict a surge past the $3,000 mark as early as June. The second-largest cryptocurrency is bucking broader market trends and raising hopes for a long-awaited altcoin season, thanks to sustained institutional inflows and positive technical indicators. Technical Hurdles and the $3K Target At the time of this writing, ETH was trading around $2,720, marking a modest 3.4% gain over the past 24 hours. The performance extended a broader uptrend, with the asset up 3.7% in the last seven days, 7.6% over two weeks, and just under 50% in the past month. This resilience has been in stark contrast to the global crypto market, which is down 2% in the last week, and Bitcoin (BTC), which momentarily dipped below $108,000 days after hitting its third all-time high (ATH) this cycle, amid recent market softness. While ETH’s ability to climb when its peers stalled highlights its current relative strength, analysts believe the immediate technical battle lies overhead. “Big resistance at $2.8K for now, which will be a tough level to break through quickly,” noted Daan Crypto Trades in a post on X. The cryptocurrency tested the $2,700 level twice this week before finally decisively pushing above it earlier today. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe sees this as a critical indicator: “Ethereum above $2,700 is a great sign. I think we’ll see $3,000+ in June,” he posted. Market Sentiment Points to Breakout Beyond price action, institutional demand is also turning into a handy bedrock support for ETH. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) is one of the best examples of this, scooping up over $32 million worth of the crypto asset on May 27. The fund has seen 13 consecutive trading days of inflows, accumulating about $170 million last week to push its total to $4.4 billion. “ETH Spot Premium also still solid,” observed Daan Crypto Trades. “It doesn’t have as many ETF inflows as BTC does but relative to its market cap doesn’t need nearly as much to keep the move going.” Furthermore, as reported by CoinDesk, firms like QCP Capital have described the market backdrop as a “Goldilocks zone,” with the easing of yields on long-dated U.S. and Japanese bonds calming investor nerves to create a potentially favorable environment for risk assets like crypto. The $2,800 resistance may present a near-term hurdle, but the confluence of persistent institutional buying, improving technical structure, and positive on-chain sentiment, married to a conducive macro environment, has analysts increasingly confident ETH can hit $3,000 next month.

Here Are the Details","US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen an impressive $4.26 billion in capital flows, recording 10 consecutive days of net inflows as of May 28. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is leading the rally. BlackRock’s IBIT Fund Sees Huge Interest: 10-Day Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surpass $4.2 Billion On Wednesday alone, Bitcoin ETFs saw $432.7 million in inflows, with nearly all of that coming from the IBIT fund alone, which attracted $481 million in inflows. On the other hand, Ark Invest's ARKB fund had a net outflow of $34.3 million, while Fidelity's FBTC fund had a net outflow of $14 million. There was no movement in the remaining funds. Of the net inflows in the 10-day period, 96% ($4.09 billion) were in the IBIT fund alone, with a total inflow of $45.6 billion across all funds since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. In comparison, IBIT has seen $49 billion in inflows since its launch, more than offsetting the $23.1 billion outflows in the high-fee Grayscale GBTC fund. IBIT has maintained its 33-day record of uninterrupted net inflows since April 9. During that time, only three days have closed with zero inflows. During those 33 days, the fund attracted $9.31 billion in inflows, bringing its assets under management to $72 billion. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, said, “There were inflows in 30 of the last 31 days. $9.5 billion in new capital… IBIT announced that it will be among the top 5 inflow-receiving ETFs in 2025. Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted, “IBIT is currently the 23rd largest ETF at $72 billion. This fund is only 1 year old, while the other youngest ETF in the top 25 is 12 years old.” Spot Bitcoin ETF trading volumes also remain at their peak. With Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $112,000 last week, weekly volume in ETFs has surpassed $25 billion. On Wednesday, May 28, ETFs traded a total of $3.4 billion. $2.6 billion of that came from the IBIT fund, which has a market share of nearly 80% in this metric. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs closed positive for the eighth consecutive day with net inflows of $84.9 million. BlackRock’s ETHA fund received $52.7 million, Fidelity’s FETH fund $25.7 million, Grayscale ETH $4.9 million, and Invesco QETH $1.6 million. The total trading volume of Ethereum ETFs was $446.9 million. The eight-day net inflow total reached $394.1 million. BlackRock’s IBIT fund is showing strong signs of continued institutional investor interest as it becomes a star not only in the Bitcoin ETF market but also in the general ETF league. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-29T15:12:59.000Z,"I'm Not Betting Against Trump: Initiating Trump Media With A Buy","Summary I'm initiating a buy on Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. due to its oversold technical setup and potential for a near-term bounce as sentiment stabilizes. Despite limited fundamentals and high volatility, I see the stock's current price as an attractive entry, especially with support at $19-$20. Trump Media's pivot to Bitcoin and blockchain, while risky, aligns with its core audience and could create new monetization opportunities. Valuation is speculative, but with sentiment so low, I believe a rebound is likely, and I recommend adding during the current weakness. I hereon share my sentiment on DJT stock and why I see more upside ahead. Investment thesis: Technical analysis Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. ( DJT ), President Donald Trump’s media company, has been among the worst-performing stocks after the April dip: the stock is down over 37% year to date, which is precisely why I’m initiating the stock with a buy. Technical factors drive my bullish call; with the stock leaning into oversold territory and recovering from overbought territory earlier this month, I think the stock could run, and this is looking like a nice play for the near-term. The stock also trades below all its moving averages, with EMA21 and EMA50 acting as near-term resistance at $24. I think a break above these EMAs should support a comeback. Still, the $19- $20 levels act as support, and a break below these levels risks retesting the $15 April lows (my worst-case scenario floor). With limited revenue, political uncertainty, and speculations about the latest crypto announcement, I am not betting on the company’s fundamentals just yet. All I’m saying is: the setup is ripe for a bounce as sentiment stabilizes, and investors are best positioned to enter at the current price, or around the next support lines: $19 and $20. Yahoo Finance Like Tesla ( TSLA ), this stock often trades more on hype and headlines than fundamentals, in my opinion, earning a spot as a \""meme stock.\"" While the risk of investing in such a stock is high, I think the stock presents an attractive entry point at current levels, especially after investors digest what are now considered negatives for the company. I beg to differ. So why was the stock down around 7% on Wednesday, and what negatives have been priced in? What happened last Tuesday? With Bitcoin (BTC-USD) trading near record highs, the company wants a place at the table and is borrowing a page straight from the MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) playbook, where crypto becomes the business model. Earlier this week, Trump Media announced plans to raise $2.5 billion, a sum it intends to convert into a Bitcoin reserve, from about 50 institutional investors, with $1.5 billion in common shares and $1 billion in convertible senior notes. Where others reinvest in software or platform development, this move places cryptocurrency at the heart of the company’s corporate strategy, further mirroring Trump’s goal to create a “strategic bitcoin reserve” for the U.S. government. Investors got spooked, and everyone and their grandmother turned bearish on the stock after the announcement. I made the MicroStrategy comparison, but things look a bit different for Trump Media. MicroStrategy has decades of enterprise software revenue to fall back on, but Trump Media is still in its early innings, with limited revenue and no profitability in sight. According to the form 10-Q reported in early May, the company “generated limited advertising revenue through Truth Social and no advertising revenue through our newly launched streaming operations, Truth+.” Yes, allocating a large sum to Bitcoin, an extremely volatile asset, could make matters worse and distract from building out core business functions. But I think the market is sleeping on the opportunity ahead. According to the company’s CEO, Devin Nunes, Trump Media views Bitcoin as : “an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.” Trump Media isn’t your typical media company; it’s politically driven and is built on narratives that challenge mainstream institutions. By embracing Bitcoin, the company is aligning itself with themes of financial independence, and through that, it resonates more strongly with its core audience. According to Nunes, the move will help enable crypto-based subscription payments and support the development of a Truth Social utility token (a proprietary digital currency designed for transactions within the platform’s blockchain ecosystem). Call me an optimist, but I think this gives the company a new digital economy to build around, in turn reducing reliance on traditional advertising and monetization, which have both been limited so far, as I mentioned above. Trump and Bitcoin: During his first term, Trump had a completely different sentiment on bitcoin, and called it “not money,” but things have changed drastically since then. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump became the first major U.S. candidate to accept crypto donations, and since returning to office, he has launched his own cryptocurrency, the $TRUMP meme coin. Just last week, Trump hosted a dinner at a high-end golf club in Virginia to honor 220 of the token’s top investors, while the top 25 investors enjoyed more special access. While marketed as a gesture of appreciation, the event got backlash from ethics watchdogs, claiming it highlights overlaps between Trump’s public duties and private financial interests. According to U.S . Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren in a letter to the Office of Government Ethics, \""The American people deserve the unwavering assurance that access to the presidency is not being offered for sale to the highest bidder in exchange for the President's own financial gain.” Valuation and what’s next: Valuation is through the roof, and the recent price movement is indicative of extreme speculation of the company’s latest moves rather than business fundamentals, which continue to struggle regardless. YChart The company has seen a steep valuation reset from the beginning of the year, with shares down nearly 37% so far. The company’s EV/Sales and Price/Book ratios have compressed by 41.7% and 35.4%, respectively, and its Price/Sales ratio has also dropped another 26%. This might seem like the market is “de-risking” the name, but a closer look suggests otherwise, at least in my opinion. Fortunately, the stock trades on momentum, and when sentiment bottoms out like it is now, a comeback is overdue. After repeated efforts to grow the business through more conventional means failed to yield results, Trump Media is now pivoting and embracing Bitcoin and blockchain narratives, something I think the company will reap the fruits of in the long term. Still, with a shift so drastic comes heightened investor scrutiny. Many are asking the question: Is this latest move a strategic breakthrough or just another distraction? I’m choosing to look at the glass half full, and I’m advising investors to add on the current panic.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790871-im-not-betting-against-trump-initiating-trump-media-with-a-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","TSLA|MSTR|STRF|STRK|TSLA:CA|BTC-USD|DJTWW|DJT",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T15:11:21.000Z,"Semler Scientific: Not The Ideal Bitcoin Treasury Company","Summary Semler Scientific's pivot to a Bitcoin treasury strategy has been successful. However, competition in the Bitcoin Treasury company space is heating up, including many well funded competitors. Declining revenues and free cash flow in its healthcare business are concerning, and Bitcoin is materially outperforming the Company year to date. Introduction Per its website , Semler Scientific, Inc. ( SMLR ) (the \"" Company \"") \""develops, manufactures and markets innovative products and services that support the early detection and treatment of chronic diseases.\"" QuantaFlo® is its patented product; namely, an \""FDA-cleared point-of-care product that measures arterial blood flow in the extremities and provides results in a matter of minutes.\"" A mediocre health care company, in May 2024 , the Company shifted its strategy and focus to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) (\"" Bitcoin \""), becoming a so called Bitcoin treasury company (a \"" BTC Treasury Co. \""). And with its healthcare business seemingly riddled with regulatory issues , recent guidance from management suggests that the Company will focus even more on Bitcoin going forward, including raising lots of capital to aggressively accumulate more Bitcoin. This article will focus upon the Company's fitness as a BTC Treasury Co. While the Company's stock price should do well if Bitcoin keeps rising, I currently consider the Company a HOLD. The reasons for the HOLD rating include 1) increased competition in the BTC Treasury Co. space, including MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), Metaplanet Inc. , privately held Twenty One Capital, several crypto miners and Asset Entities Ltd. ( ASST ), among others, and 2) the simplicity of owning Bitcoin outright compared to owning the Company's stock, particularly when the Company's healthcare operations are not currently generating positive free cash flow. Financial Strength and Related Matters The ideal BTC Treasury Co. would have an easy to understand underlying business that generates lots of free cash flow. Said BTC Treasury Co. could then plough that excess cash flow back into the acquisition of more Bitcoin, without diluting shareholders . In the case of the Company, however, its underlying business operations are not currently throwing off free cash flow. Excluding the \""Change in fair value of digital assets\"" line item on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows, net cash provided by operations for the periods ended March 31, 2025 , March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were as follows: (In Thousands of $) March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Net Cash Provided by Operations (1,906) 5,624 861 Minus the Increase in Change in fair value of digital assets 41,829 -- -- Total Cash from Operations (43,435) 5,624 861 Source: 10Qs for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2023 (links in the above paragraph); table created by Author. The above table shows that the Company's underlying healthcare business is currently burning through cash. Unsurprisingly, at only $8.8 million, revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025 experienced a 44% year over year decline. On top declining operating revenues, the Company's regulatory controls relating to its underlying healthcare business are questionable in light of a recent settlement with the Department of Justice . The settlement requires the Company to pay a nearly $30 million fine. The Company will finance the settlement payment with a loan from Coinbase Global Inc. ( COIN ). The Company's Bitcoin will secure the loan. Basic metrics of the Company's financial strength, such as the current ratio are also declining. (In Thousands of $) March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Total Current Assets $18,452 $71,905 $55,592 Total Current Liabilities 35,667 5,903 8,918 Current Ratio 0.52 12.18 6.23 Source: 10Qs for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 (linked above), March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 (linked above); table created by Author. Of course, the Company has been leveraging its balance sheet to buy more Bitcoin , in addition to funding the healthcare business. As such, the current ratio may not be the most helpful way to assess the financial strength of the Company. Nonetheless, the low current ratio, coupled with the negative cash flow, signal that the Company is risky relative to owning Bitcoin outright. In a large Bitcoin drawdown, the Company may have to sell Bitcoin at a low price (i.e., at the wrong time) in order to fund operations, service its debt and pay trade creditors. In light of the above described backdrop, it comes as no surprise to me that Bitcoin is outperforming the Company year-to-date (through May 23rd) by a wide margin, as shown in the chart below. Seeking Alpha Notably, the Company's stock is trading around $44 as of the time of writing, well below its 52-week high of $81.56, while Bitcoin is trading near all-time highs ($110,211 at the time of writing). Investors should also be aware that during the December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2025 period, outstanding common shares have increased from roughly 7.1 million to 9.8 million, a nearly 40% gain in shares outstanding. In isolation, the dilution is problem for shareholders; however, the Company does seem to be adding value here as the Bitcoin Yield has increased by 22.2% year to date. Risks In addition to the risks embedded in the discussion above, other risks of the Company are included or referenced below. As a constituent of the Russell 2000 Index, the Company is not the beneficiary of the same level of passive capital inflows that accrue to constituents of larger and more popular equity indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100. When everything is about flows, this could prove a competitive disadvantage for the Company, particularly if other BTC Treasury Co.'s are the beneficiaries of inclusion in larger indexes. More automatic capital inflows will generally mean a lower cost of capital. Increased competition (discussed below) for such passive flows could have an adverse effect on the Company. Competition in the BTC Treasury Co. space is growing. New entrants to the space may be better funded and have better business models than the Company. For example, the recently formed Twenty One Capital aims to compete with MicroStrategy and recently acquired more than $450 million of Bitcoin. Japanese company, Metaplanet , is growing rapidly. Several bitcoin miners have issued debt and/or equity to acquire more Bitcoin. Moreover, Asset Entities, Inc. ( ASST ) is converting to a BTC Treasury Co. with its reverse merger with Strive Asset Management, and the newly combined company has novel ideas on how to accumulate more Bitcoin. The Company's healthcare business is highly regulated and failure to comply with applicable regulations can result in material fines and penalties, an example of which was referenced earlier in the article. Other risks of owning share in the Company are outlined in the Company's most recent 10K (starting on page 2 thereof). Conclusion In the fast moving BTC Treasury Co. space, I do not think the Company currently stands out among the field. If it can turn its healthcare business into a cash flow generating asset, however, I would be interested in giving it another look. For now, I reiterate that the Company is a HOLD.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790867-semler-scientific-not-the-ideal-bitcoin-treasury-company?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","BTC-USD|SMLR",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T15:10:08.000Z,"Bitcoin: Smarter Web Company’s Bold Move Boosts Corporate Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Smarter Web Company’s Bold Move Boosts Corporate Holdings In the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, a significant development has emerged from London. The Smarter Web Company, a technology firm listed on the London stock exchange, recently made headlines with a notable increase in its Bitcoin holdings. This move isn’t just a simple transaction; it signals a growing trend among publicly traded companies to allocate a portion of their balance sheets to digital currencies. The company announced via an official statement that it has acquired an additional 24.53 BTC, a decision that brings its total Company Bitcoin Holdings to an impressive 83.24 BTC. Why are Companies Like The Smarter Web Company Buying Bitcoin? This question is on the minds of many investors and market observers. While traditional finance often views cryptocurrencies with caution, a growing number of corporations are starting to see Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic reserve. Several factors are driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, companies are looking for assets that can potentially preserve or grow value over the long term, unlike cash which may lose purchasing power. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and fixed supply (capped at 21 million coins) position it as a potential digital store of value, often compared to digital gold. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets away from traditional financial instruments like cash, bonds, and equities. Balance Sheet Strategy: For some companies, holding Bitcoin aligns with a forward-thinking strategy, embracing emerging technologies and potentially signaling innovation to investors. Potential Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns on corporate capital. For a technology firm like The Smarter Web Company , holding Bitcoin could also be seen as an extension of their core business – engaging with cutting-edge digital advancements and the future of finance. What Does This Acquisition Mean for Their Company Bitcoin Holdings? Adding 24.53 BTC is a substantial acquisition for The Smarter Web Company. Moving from 58.71 BTC to 83.24 BTC represents an increase of over 40%. While this figure might seem modest compared to giants like MicroStrategy, which holds tens of thousands of Bitcoin , it’s significant for a company of The Smarter Web Company’s size and profile. It demonstrates a reinforced conviction in their initial strategy and a willingness to increase their exposure to the asset class. Their total of 83.24 BTC solidifies their position among publicly listed companies that have allocated capital to cryptocurrencies. It places them in a category of firms actively exploring alternative treasury management strategies in the digital age. The value of these Company Bitcoin Holdings will fluctuate with the market, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Is This Part of a Larger Trend in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Absolutely. The move by The Smarter Web Company is not an isolated incident but rather a piece of a much larger puzzle indicating increasing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption globally. Companies across various sectors, from technology and payments to manufacturing, have publicly announced purchases of Bitcoin for their balance sheets. Pioneers in this space include: MicroStrategy: Arguably the most vocal proponent, holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Tesla: Briefly held significant Bitcoin, though they later sold a portion, their initial purchase highlighted the asset’s potential to a mainstream audience. Block (formerly Square): A payment processing company that has made strategic investments in Bitcoin and is actively involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Other Public Companies: A growing list of smaller and mid-cap companies are quietly adding Bitcoin to their reserves. This trend signifies a maturation of the asset class and a growing acceptance by traditional corporate structures. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is moving from being a fringe idea to a recognized, albeit still debated, treasury management strategy. What are the Implications of Institutional Crypto Investment? The involvement of publicly traded companies like The Smarter Web Company falls under the umbrella of Institutional Crypto Investment . When institutions, whether corporations, asset managers, or hedge funds, begin allocating significant capital to cryptocurrencies, it has several profound implications: Increased Legitimacy: Institutional interest lends credibility to the cryptocurrency market, helping to dispel the notion that it’s solely for retail investors or illicit activities. Greater Market Liquidity: Large institutional trades can add significant volume and liquidity to exchanges. Potential for Reduced Volatility: While still volatile, increased institutional holding for long-term treasury purposes could potentially contribute to a more stable market over time compared to purely speculative trading. Regulatory Scrutiny: As institutional involvement grows, so does the attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to clearer guidelines and frameworks. Product Development: Growing institutional demand spurs the development of regulated investment products and services catering to these entities. Institutional Crypto Investment is a key driver pushing the crypto market towards mainstream financial integration. What are the Potential Benefits and Risks for Companies Holding Bitcoin? Like any investment, holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet comes with its own set of potential benefits and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: The possibility of substantial returns if the price of Bitcoin increases significantly over the holding period. Inflation Protection: As discussed, a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Balance Sheet Strength (in a bull market): Increased asset value can improve the look of a company’s balance sheet. Attracting Investors: Some investors are specifically looking for companies with exposure to the digital asset space. Potential Risks: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods, potentially leading to significant paper losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving and varies by jurisdiction. Accounting Challenges: Under current accounting rules (like GAAP or IFRS), Bitcoin is often treated as an intangible asset subject to impairment testing, meaning companies must report a loss if the price drops below their cost basis, even if they haven’t sold. They cannot report gains until they sell. Security Risks: Holding and securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Reputational Risk: Negative market sentiment or regulatory issues could impact the company’s public image. Companies considering this path, like The Smarter Web Company , must carefully weigh these factors and have a clear strategy for managing their exposure. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Balance Sheets? The decision by The Smarter Web Company to increase its Company Bitcoin Holdings is a strong indicator that the trend of corporate adoption is likely to continue. As the digital asset market matures and regulatory clarity potentially improves, more companies may explore adding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets. This could reshape traditional corporate finance, making digital assets a more common component of treasury management alongside cash, bonds, and other traditional investments. The success or challenges faced by early adopters like The Smarter Web Company will likely influence the pace and scale of future Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . While the path forward is not without its hurdles, the continued movement of publicly traded companies into the crypto space suggests a long-term shift in how corporate value and treasury management are perceived in the digital economy. This growing interest from entities involved in Institutional Crypto Investment underscores the increasing integration of digital assets into the global financial system. In conclusion, The Smarter Web Company’s decision to boost its Bitcoin reserves to 83.24 BTC is more than just a company announcement; it’s a microcosm of the broader, accelerating trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption and Institutional Crypto Investment . It highlights the strategic considerations companies are making in response to macroeconomic pressures and the potential of digital assets. As more firms follow suit, the line between traditional finance and the crypto world will continue to blur, potentially paving the way for a new era of corporate treasury management.

U.S. spot ether ETFs logged an estimated $84 million in net inflows on May 28, as investor interest held firm even with ether falling 1.3%, the bank said in a report published on Thursday. Leading the pack was BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which brought in $52 million, followed by Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) with $26 million. Grayscale’s mini ETH Trust and Invesco/Galaxy’s QETH added $5 million and $2 million, respectively, the bank noted. Notably, ether ETFs recorded a notional trading volume of $459 million, well above their post-launch daily average of approximately $375 million since debuting in July 2024 , the bank observed. Meanwhile, spot bitcoin ETFs brought in an estimated $431 million in net inflows, JPMorgan said, largely powered by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which alone saw $479 million in new investment. The strong inflow was partially offset by redemptions from ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), the bank noted, which shed $34 million, and Fidelity’s FBTC, which recorded $14 million in outflows. Despite bitcoin's 2.1% drop in price, total trading volumes remained elevated, clocking in at $3.5 billion, compared to the group’s historical average of $2.8 billion per day since launching in January 2024, the report added. Investors are moving from gold to bitcoin ETFs, according to a Thursday report by Bloomberg. U.S. bitcoin ETFs have seen $9 billion in inflows over the last 5 weeks versus $2.8 billion in outflows for gold-backed funds.

Scheduled for release in early 2026, the machine offers an energy efficiency of 9.7 joules per terahash (J/TH), a new benchmark in mining technology. For context, the first dedicated bitcoin ASIC miner launched in 2013 consumed roughly 1,200 J/TH. But while the S23 Hydro represents a leap forward in hardware design, it arrives at a time of tension in the mining economy, analysts at TheMinerMag wrote in a Thursday report. In past market cycles, major efficiency upgrades were timed with bear markets, giving miners a head start ahead of bitcoin halving events. This launch breaks that pattern: bitcoin recently surged past $100,000, but miner profitability hasn’t kept pace. The core issue is hashprice, the analysts said. Despite the rally, hashprice has remained low, dipping below $39/PH/s earlier this year. Facing smaller and smaller margins, several large firms have paused hashrate expansion plans. Instead of fueling network expansion, the S23 Hydro and similar rigs may be used to upgrade existing fleets. That’s a notable shift. As older models get retired, the overall power efficiency of the Bitcoin network could improve — possibly even reducing total power consumption, a first in the protocol’s history. The new machine’s launch signals a new era where efficiency gains are about surviving squeezed margins, not just chasing growth. If hashprice doesn’t recover to pre-2024 halving levels of around $100/PH/s, miners could face steeper headwinds in future downturns. The Antminer S23 Hydro may be cutting-edge, but the economic terrain it enters is more uncertain than ever.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/29/bitmains-new-antminer-launch-signals-profound-shift-for-bitcoin-miners-theminermag,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin Mining|Bitmain|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto for Advisors: Crypto Universe","In today’s Crypto for Advisors, Fabian Dori , Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum Bank , explores why crypto is more than just an asset class and looks at the institutional adoption of decentralized finance. Then, Abhishek Pingle , co-founder of Theo , answers questions about how risk-adverse investors can approach decentralized finance and what to look for in Ask an Expert. – Sarah Morton Unknown block type \""divider\"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Crypto Is Not an Asset Class — It's an Asset Universe Moody's recently warned that public blockchains pose a risk to institutional investors. At the same time, U.S. bitcoin ETFs are drawing billions in inflows. We’re seeing the start of a long-awaited shift in institutional adoption. But crypto's real potential lies far beyond passive bitcoin exposure. It's not just an asset class — it's an asset universe, spanning yield-generating strategies, directional plays, and hedge fund-style alpha. Most institutions are only scratching the surface of what's possible. Institutional investors may enhance their risk-return profile by moving beyond a monolithic view of crypto and recognizing three distinct segments: yield-generating strategies, directional investments, and alternative strategies. Like traditional fixed income, yield-generating strategies offer limited market risk with low volatility. Typical strategies range from tokenized money market funds that earn traditional yields to approaches engaging with the decentralized crypto finance ecosystem, which deliver attractive returns without traditional duration or credit risk. These crypto yield strategies may boast attractive Sharpe ratios, rivalling high-yield bonds' risk premia but with different mechanics. For example, returns can be earned from protocol participation, lending and borrowing activities, funding rate arbitrage strategies, and liquidity provisioning. Unlike bonds that face principal erosion in rising rate environments, many crypto yield strategies function largely independently of central bank policy and provide genuine portfolio diversification precisely when it's most needed. However, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Crypto yield strategies entail risks, mainly centered around the maturity and security of the protocols and platforms a strategy engages with. The path to institutional adoption typically follows three distinct approaches aligned with different investor profiles: Risk-averse institutions begin with yield-generating strategies that limit direct market exposure while capturing attractive returns. These entry points enable traditional investors to benefit from the unique yields available in the crypto ecosystem without incurring the volatility associated with directional exposure. Mainstream institutions often adopt a bitcoin-first approach before gradually diversifying into other assets. Starting with bitcoin provides a familiar narrative and established regulatory clarity before expanding into more complex strategies and assets. Sophisticated players like family offices and specialized asset managers explore the entire crypto ecosystem from the outset and build comprehensive strategies that leverage the full range of opportunities across the risk spectrum. Contrary to early industry predictions, tokenization is progressing from liquid assets like stablecoins and money market funds upward, driven by liquidity and familiarity, not promises of democratizing illiquid assets. More complex assets are following suit, revealing a pragmatic adoption curve. Moody's caution about protocol risk exceeding traditional counterparty risk deserves scrutiny. This narrative may deter institutions from crypto's yield layer, yet it highlights only one side of the coin. While blockchain-based assets introduce technical risks, these risks are often transparent and auditable, unlike the potentially opaque risk profiles of counterparties in traditional finance. Smart contracts, for example, offer new levels of transparency. Their code can be audited, stress-tested, and verified independently. This means risk assessment can be conducted with fewer assumptions and greater precision than financial institutions with off-balance-sheet exposures. Major decentralized finance platforms now undergo multiple independent audits and maintain significant insurance reserves. They have, at least partially, mitigated risks in the public blockchain environment that Moody's warned against. While tokenization doesn't eliminate the inherent counterparty risk associated with the underlying assets, blockchain technology provides a more efficient and resilient infrastructure for accessing them. Ultimately, institutional investors should apply traditional investment principles to these novel asset classes while acknowledging the vast array of opportunities within digital assets. The question isn't whether to allocate to crypto but rather which specific segments of the crypto asset universe align with particular portfolio objectives and risk tolerances. Institutional investors are well-positioned to develop tailored allocation strategies that leverage the unique characteristics of different segments of the crypto ecosystem. - Fabian Dori, chief investment officer, Sygnum Bank Unknown block type \""divider\"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ask an Expert Q: What yield-generating strategies are institutions using on-chain today? A: The most promising strategies are delta-neutral, meaning they are neutral to price movements. This includes arbitrage between centralized and decentralized exchanges, capturing funding rates, and short-term lending across fragmented liquidity pools. These generate net yields of 7–15% without wider market exposure. Q: What structural features of DeFi enable more efficient capital deployment compared to traditional finance? A: We like to think of decentralized finance (DeFi) as “on-chain markets”. On-chain markets unlock capital efficiency by removing intermediaries, enabling programmable strategies, and offering real-time access to on-chain data. Unlike traditional finance, where capital often sits idle due to batch processing, counterparty delays, or opaque systems, on-chain markets provide a world where liquidity can be routed dynamically across protocols based on quantifiable risk and return metrics. Features like composability and permissionless access enable assets to be deployed, rebalanced, or withdrawn in real-time, often with automated safeguards. This architecture supports strategies that are both agile and transparent, particularly important for institutions that optimize across fragmented liquidity pools or manage volatility exposure. Q: How should a risk-averse institution approach yield on-chain? A: Many institutions exploring DeFi take a cautious first step by evaluating stablecoin-based, non-directional strategies, as explained above, that aim to offer consistent yields with limited market exposure. These approaches are often framed around capital preservation and transparency, with infrastructure that supports on-chain risk monitoring, customizable guardrails, and secure custody. For firms seeking yield diversification without the duration risk of traditional fixed income, these strategies are gaining traction as a conservative entry point into on-chain markets. - Abhishek Pingle, co-founder, Theo Unknown block type \""divider\"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Keep Reading Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,878 last week.

2025-05-29T14:59:14.000Z,"Peter Schiff Calls Bitcoin a 'Giant Cult,' Doubles Down on Gold","Peter Schiff, one of Bitcoin’s most vocal critics, took the stage at the Bitcoin 2025 conference on Thursday and didn’t hold back. During a fiery conversation with journalist Natalie Brunell at the Venetian Convention Center in Las Vegas, the longtime gold advocate dismissed the Bitcoin BTC community as “a giant cult” and said the digital asset resembles a “memecoin.” Schiff, who rose to prominence as a stockbroker and gold bug, has long argued that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. On stage, he reiterated that claim and pointed to global central banks still accumulating gold — not bitcoin — as evidence that gold remains the true reserve asset. “Every time I tell people not to buy bitcoin, they buy more,” he quipped. “I’m probably responsible for more people owning bitcoin than anyone else at this conference.” His comments came in response to U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, who said earlier that day that bitcoin had created “unparalleled wealth” over the last decade. Schiff pushed back, arguing that the wealth generated by the crypto asset doesn’t represent value creation but rather a transfer of wealth from latecomers to early adopters. “It’s a pyramid structure,” he said, “not innovation.” While the crowd responded with a mix of laughter and groans, Schiff stayed on message: bitcoin’s price, he said, is propelled by hype, not economic fundamentals. The jab stood in contrast to the rest of the week’s festivities, where many speakers celebrated bitcoin’s growing institutional acceptance and financial footprint.

The findings contradict Michael Saylor’s warnings about disclosing wallet addresses due to security risks. Strategy has slowed its Bitcoin purchases as MSTR’s premium shrinks and competition in corporate BTC holdings grows. Arkham Intelligence has linked over $7.6 billion worth of Bitcoin to Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy. In a recent post , the blockchain analytics firm claimed to have identified wallet addresses holding 70,816 BTC tied to the company, despite public resistance from its co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor, to disclose such information. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did,” Arkham wrote. Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Now Pegged at $54.5B, Says Arkham If the data is accurate, the new wallets bring Strategy’s total identified Bitcoin holdings to $54.5 billion, representing around 87.5% of the firm’s total BTC reserves, according to Arkham’s analysis. The revelation directly counters Saylor’s recent remarks at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, where he warned against exposing wallet addresses. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth,” Saylor said. He argued that transparency of wallet activity creates long-term vulnerabilities, including transaction tracing and predictive behavioral analytics. Saylor further suggested using AI to simulate attack scenarios, warning that the technology could generate “50 pages” of potential risks just from the exposure of wallet addresses alone.

Arkham’s findings come amid heightened scrutiny over its wallet-labeling methods, with past allegations of misidentification—such as those from Mantra CEO John Mullin, who denied Arkham’s claims during the platform’s token collapse. Strategy Slows Bitcoin Buys as MSTR Premium Shrinks Strategy appears to be easing its pace of Bitcoin acquisitions, according to a report from K33 Research . The company, led by co-founder Michael Saylor, remains the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin, but its recent purchase cadence has cooled compared to the frenzied buying seen last November. In its latest filing, Strategy revealed it bought 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for $427.1 million, using proceeds from its ongoing $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering. However, capital raised from the program has slowed. Only $348.7 million was deployed during that week, down from $705.7 million the week prior and $1.31 billion in early May. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributes the deceleration to two key factors: a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, and intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. Meanwhile, Jeff Walton, an analyst at Strategy, has said the firm may one day rise to become the top publicly traded company in the world. Walton believes the company’s unprecedented exposure to Bitcoin, which recently crossed $111,000, gives it a unique edge.

2025-05-29T14:50:59.000Z,"UK Government Declares Firm ‘No’ to Bitcoin Reserves Amid Volatility Fears","BitcoinWorld UK Government Declares Firm ‘No’ to Bitcoin Reserves Amid Volatility Fears In a significant announcement that clarifies the United Kingdom’s official stance on digital assets at the highest level, the UK government has definitively ruled out integrating Bitcoin into its national strategic reserves. This decision, primarily driven by concerns over the inherent volatility of the leading cryptocurrency, was confirmed by Member of Parliament Emma Reynolds, according to reports originating from Cointelegraph on X. For those closely following the intersection of traditional finance, government policy, and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, this statement provides crucial clarity. While many nations and institutions are exploring various roles for digital assets, the UK is taking a cautious approach when it comes to managing national wealth. Why is the UK Government Avoiding Bitcoin Reserves? The primary reason cited by MP Emma Reynolds for the UK’s decision is cryptocurrency volatility . Strategic reserves, particularly foreign exchange reserves, are managed with core principles focused on stability, liquidity, and capital preservation. These reserves are typically held in stable, widely accepted assets like major fiat currencies (USD, EUR, JPY), gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Bitcoin, known for its rapid and often unpredictable price swings, is seen as fundamentally incompatible with these objectives. Governments hold reserves for various critical purposes: To manage exchange rates and support the national currency. To provide liquidity in times of economic crisis. To diversify national assets (though stability is paramount here). To maintain confidence in the country’s financial stability. Introducing an asset like Bitcoin, which can experience double-digit percentage price changes in a single day, could introduce unacceptable levels of risk and uncertainty into a portfolio designed for stability. Understanding Strategic Reserves: What Are They and Why Do They Matter? Strategic reserves are a nation’s assets held by its central bank or monetary authority. They are crucial tools for economic stability and national security. The most common type is foreign exchange reserves, which are holdings of foreign currencies, gold, and other highly liquid assets. Think of them as a nation’s emergency fund and financial toolkit. They allow a government to intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilize its currency, pay for essential imports during crises, service foreign debts, and generally project financial strength and credibility on the global stage. The management of these reserves is typically conservative. The focus is on preserving capital and ensuring liquidity, not on speculative growth. This fundamental principle is why assets with extreme volatility, like Bitcoin, are deemed unsuitable by many central bankers and finance ministries globally. Who is Emma Reynolds and What is Her Role? Emma Reynolds is a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom. Her statement, while potentially reflecting the government’s broader position, provides insight into the thinking within parliamentary circles regarding digital assets and their potential role in national finance. While the original source points to her confirmation of the decision, it’s important to note that official government policy statements typically come from the Treasury or the Bank of England. However, a confirmation from an MP like Reynolds, especially if connected to relevant committees or discussions, carries weight in understanding the prevailing sentiment and policy direction within the UK government . Comparing Traditional Reserve Assets vs. Bitcoin Let’s look at how traditional reserve assets stack up against Bitcoin in the context of national reserves: Feature Traditional Reserve Assets (e.g., USD, Gold) Bitcoin Volatility Relatively Low (compared to Bitcoin) Extremely High Liquidity Very High (easily bought/sold in large volumes) High, but market depth can vary; large transactions can impact price Acceptance Globally accepted by central banks and governments Increasing, but not universally accepted by governments as a reserve Regulatory Status Well-defined and regulated globally Varies significantly by jurisdiction; regulatory landscape is evolving Storage/Security Established, secure systems (vaults, central bank accounts) Requires digital security (private keys), susceptible to hacks if not managed perfectly Correlation Often uncorrelated or negatively correlated with certain risks Correlation with tech stocks and risk-on assets observed; behavior in a global financial crisis is untested This comparison highlights the core conflict: the very characteristics that make Bitcoin attractive to some investors (potential for high returns, decentralization) are precisely what make it problematic for conservative strategic reserves management. Could This Stance Change in the Future? While the current position is clear, the world of finance and technology is constantly evolving. Several factors could potentially influence the UK government ‘s stance in the distant future, although there’s no indication this is imminent: Maturation of the Crypto Market: As the market grows, regulation becomes clearer, and institutional participation increases, cryptocurrency volatility *might* decrease over very long timeframes, though this is speculative. Development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): While different from Bitcoin, the successful implementation and widespread use of CBDCs by major economies could normalize the idea of digital assets in central banking. Global Adoption by Other Nations: If other major economies were to successfully integrate Bitcoin or similar assets into their reserves (a highly unlikely scenario given current principles), it could force a reconsideration. Fundamental Shift in Reserve Management Philosophy: A global economic paradigm shift might lead central banks to prioritize different characteristics in their reserves. However, based on the current understanding of macroeconomics, financial stability, and the role of reserves, a shift towards including volatile assets like Bitcoin seems highly improbable in the foreseeable future. The statement attributed to Emma Reynolds solidifies this current perspective. Challenges Beyond Volatility While volatility is the primary concern, holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset presents other challenges for a government: Security: Managing private keys for vast sums of Bitcoin requires extremely robust and novel security protocols, different from securing physical gold or traditional bank accounts. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still fragmented and evolving. Lack of Yield: Unlike some traditional assets, Bitcoin does not inherently generate interest or dividends. Public Perception & Political Risk: A government holding a highly speculative asset could face significant public and political backlash if its value plummeted. These factors further reinforce the conservative approach taken by the UK government regarding Bitcoin reserves . Actionable Insight: What Does This Mean for Investors? For individual or institutional investors, the UK’s stance doesn’t necessarily dictate personal investment strategy. However, it serves as a reminder of how different entities view and manage risk. Governments, responsible for national economic stability, prioritize capital preservation and liquidity above all else in their reserves. Investors with different risk tolerances and objectives may view Bitcoin differently. The key takeaway is understanding the *why* behind the government’s decision: cryptocurrency volatility is fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of strategic reserves . This doesn’t invalidate Bitcoin as an asset class for others, but it clearly defines its current limitations in official government finance. Conclusion: A Clear Signal from the UK The confirmation from MP Emma Reynolds that the UK government has no plans to hold Bitcoin reserves sends a clear signal. It underscores the traditional, conservative approach the UK takes towards managing its national wealth and ensuring financial stability. The inherent cryptocurrency volatility of Bitcoin is seen as a fundamental barrier to its inclusion in assets designed for security and liquidity. While the crypto landscape continues to evolve, this decision highlights the significant gap that still exists between decentralized digital assets and the established principles governing national economic security.

From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Ethereum Foundation turns to DeFi for cash","The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has borrowed $2 million in GHO, a decentralized stablecoin developed by Aave, in a move signaling deeper engagement with decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.  In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

2025-05-29T12:30:00.000Z,"Donut Labs raises $7M to launch first ‘agentic’ crypto browser","New York-based Donut Labs has raised $7 million in a pre-seed funding round to build what it claims is the world’s first “agentic” crypto browser — a tool designed to help users interact with blockchain-based applications using artificial intelligence.The round was led by Sequoia, Bitkraft and HackVC, with participation from angel investors including Solana and other ecosystem leaders, such as Matrix Partners, Sky9 Ventures, Makers Fund and SonicSVM.The $7 million will support the development of Donut, an executable crypto browser powered by artificial intelligence agents, with a native cryptocurrency wallet and decentralized exchange integration, decentralized network access and onchain execution.Unlike traditional web browsers, Donut’s AI algorithms understand page context and user intent, helping it autonomously execute blockchain-based operations.“The traditional browser hasn’t changed for more than 30 years. We’re re-architecting everything,” said Donut founder and CEO Chris Zhu. “We’re reconstructing the front end of the internet to be hyper-financialized for AI agents.”  Donut closes $7 million pre-seed round. Source: DonutRelated: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin ‘premium’ nears $600K per BTCDonut’s users will gain access to an array of decentralized tools and crypto services under a single agentic interface, which could make digital asset transactions safer.“Architecturally isolated signing environments and AI-powered risk screening secure every transaction while optimizing execution for speed and cost,” said Zhu, adding that “AI translates opaque calldata into plain English and assigns safety grades.”Donut’s AI agents can trade or swap tokens, place bets, or earn passive yield on digital assets.Related: Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoptionAgentic browsers could reshape internet in next decadeWhile Donut’s earliest adopters will likely be crypto traders, builders or decentralized finance (DeFi) users, agentic browsers may explode into the mainstream during the next decade.Within the next five years, Ethereum layer-2 (L2) networks will use agentic browsers to cut settlement costs. Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

SOL/ETH weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April. Daily fees peaked in Q1 2025 but have since fallen to near-yearly lows, signaling reduced speculative activity on the chain, according to Dune Analytics.Pump.Fun fee and revenue chart.

It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said.“I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.”New York City Mayor Eric Adams wants a Bitcoin bond and to axe the State BitLicense program. BitSource: YouTubeAdams didn’t share details about how a Bitbond would work; however, a March 31 policy brief paper from advocacy group the Bitcoin Policy Institute proposed a model where holders receive an annual interest rate of 1% for 10 years.When the bond matures, holders also receive a percentage of any Bitcoin market gains. At the same time, 90% of the funds raised through the bonds are allocated to government spending, while 10% is used to purchase Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s bond policy brief.Adams again pushes to axe BitLicenseAdams also called for repealing New York’s BitLicense program, which the state launched in 2015 ﻿and requires crypto businesses to apply for a license with the New York Department of Financial Services and meet strict compliance standards.The BitLicense program has received criticism from the industry, and Adams has also said the measure is too costly with high licensing fees, and is too stringent with its Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures. “You have a mayor who is the crypto mayor, is the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the city of New York, where you won’t be attacked and criminalized,” he said.“Let’s get rid of the Bitcoin license and allow us to have the free flow of Bitcoin in our city.”Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summitUSDC stablecoin issuer Circle was one of the first crypto companies to receive a BitLicense; others have since followed, including crypto exchange Coinbase and trading firm Bakkt.Adams has been actively pushing to attract crypto firms to New York City.

2025-05-29T06:07:12.000Z,"Bitcoin $120K ‘epic mic drop’ rally set after US court blocks Trump tariffs","Bitcoin is poised to rally toward $120,000 after a US federal court blocked the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, a crypto analyst says.“The trade court decision was an epic mic drop, and it’s going to intensify momentum behind Bitcoin,” Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph. The US Court of International Trade reportedly blocked Trump from imposing his tariffs on May 28, arguing that he overstepped his authority.Court “blows a hole in trade talks”Hundal said the decision would have a domino effect on Bitcoin’s price and believes “new all-time highs are imminent, and the momentum is largely irreversible at this stage.”Bitcoin’s (BTC) current all-time high of $111,970 was reached on May 22, but it has since fallen to trade around $107,750, according to CoinMarketCap data.Bitcoin is down 3.36% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCapThe Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed.“It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.”On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers, levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10%.Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified.“The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, really — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said, “Buy everything round dos.”Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrowCrypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said, “So Trump tariffs are illegal? Does that mean we get green candles all around tomorrow?”Hundal said “a wall of money” is coming into Bitcoin through corporations, spot Bitcoin ETFs and retail.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028. The remaining 15 million Swedish krona ($1.5 million) will come through a new share issuance and warrants, according to K33. If investors convert their warrants before March 2026, they are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance.

2025-05-28T22:20:00.000Z,"Ethereum bulls aim for $2.7K ahead of ETH’s $2.4B options expiry","Key takeaways:97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share. Ethereum no longer ranks among the top ten protocols in terms of fees, creating a supply imbalance that contributes to inflationary pressure on ETH.Sell (put) options ill-prepared for ETH prices above $2,600ETH options aggregate open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $2,300 and $2,500: $420 million in calls (buy) vs. $220 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $200 million.Between $2,500 and $2,600: $500 million calls vs. $130 million puts, favoring calls by $370 million.Between $2,600 and $2,700: $590 million calls vs. $35 million puts, favoring calls by $555 million.Between $2,700 and $2,900: $780 million calls vs. $10 million puts, favoring calls by $770 million.Bulls are strongly incentivized to push ETH past $2,700, yet the broader context may override those efforts. Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”“We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats,” said US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. The Labor Department under Biden criticized the practice of marketing cryptocurrencies to 401(k) participants. At the time, the agency claimed cryptocurrencies posed “significant risks and challenges” to participants’ retirement accounts due to their “speculative and volatile” nature and “valuation concerns,” among other reasons.The American Banking Association (ABA) criticized the 2022 compliance release, claiming that it did not make the guidance available for public comment and review prior to issuance.Related: Fidelity introduces retirement accounts with minimal-fee crypto investingTrump administration shifts crypto landscapePresident Trump has pledged to make the United States “the world capital of crypto” during his 2024 campaign.Under his administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has scaled back several enforcement actions and investigations involving Web3 companies such as Uniswap, Coinbase, and Kraken, while also engaging in policy discussions on topics like real-world asset tokenization and the regulatory status of certain tokens.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738.

They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5.

This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast.

Bitcoin to $250,000 by year-end if the Fed pivots to QEBitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said Bitcoin could soar to $250,000 in 2025 if the US Federal Reserve resumes quantitative easing (QE). Writing in April, Hayes argued that Bitcoin is driven by expectations of fiat supply growth, and the Fed’s shift from quantitative tightening (QT) to easing would trigger a major rally.The DXY US dollar index is down 8.20% year to date.

2025-05-28T13:33:33.000Z,"UK FCA requests public comments on stablecoin, crypto custody regulation","The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has requested public feedback on proposed regulations for stablecoins and cryptocurrency custody.In a May 28 request for comment, the United Kingdom’s financial regulator announced that its regulatory proposals are “the latest milestone on the road to crypto regulation.” The draft rules are based on prior roundtables and industry feedback. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets. At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.”The FCA also noted it will work with the UK’s central bank to regulate stablecoins. Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said, “For those stablecoins that expect to operate at systemic scale, the Bank of England will publish a complementary consultation paper later this year.”Related: UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini reportEnsuring stablecoins remain stableThe FCA said that its rules “aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value.” The regulator said customers must be clearly informed about how the backing assets are managed. It also recommended that stablecoin issuers appoint independent third-party custodians to hold reserve assets:“We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency, irrespective of the value of the backing assets portfolio, with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.“Breeden added that the FCA’s proposals are part of a broader effort to build the UK’s stablecoin regime.Related: UK to require crypto firms to report every customer transactionCrypto custody rules incomingThe FCA’s proposals also introduce new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services, as outlined in a separate discussion paper. The rules are designed to ensure that user assets are secure and can be accessed at any time:“The FCA's proposals would require firms providing crypto custody services, who have responsibility for keeping consumers’ crypto safe, to ensure they are effectively secured and can be easily accessed at any time.“Proposed measures also aim to reduce both the likelihood and impact of crypto firms failing, both in the crypto custody and stablecoin sectors. The ongoing efforts also follow the recent revelation by UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves of plans for a “comprehensive regulatory regime” aimed at making the country a crypto leader.Magazine: UK’s Orwellian AI murder prediction system, will AI take your job?
