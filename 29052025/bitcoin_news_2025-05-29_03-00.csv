2025-05-29T00:30:49.000Z,"Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg","As Bitcoin and Ethereum hover near critical resistance levels, market sentiment is shifting rapidly. Analysts are now calling for an incoming Altseason, with bullish momentum building across the board, even as macroeconomic uncertainty continues to rattle global markets. Despite rising treasury yields and geopolitical tensions, crypto assets are showing strength, and altcoins appear poised to benefit next. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally Top analyst Axel Bitblaze has spotlighted May 30th as a potentially defining moment in this cycle. This week, over $5 billion in stablecoins will be distributed to FTX creditors—a massive injection of liquidity representing nearly 2% of the entire stablecoin supply. Unlike previous events, this capital is expected to stay within the crypto ecosystem. Most of these investors remained in crypto despite the FTX collapse. Now, as they regain access to their funds, many are likely to rotate that capital back into the market. With Bitcoin targeting $120K and Ethereum challenging the $3,000 level, the stage is set for capital to flow into high-beta altcoins and push for an Altseason. Altcoins Setup Strengthens Ahead Of $5B FTX Liquidity Injection The FTX collapse in late 2022 was a brutal event, marking the climax of the previous bear market. It triggered mass panic, billions in liquidations, and the final capitulation that ultimately set the bottom of the cycle. While devastating in the short term, it paved the way for recovery. Now, nearly two years later, May 30th may become the most important day of this new phase. FTX is distributing over $5 billion in stablecoins to creditors this week—a long-awaited step in the bankruptcy process. These payouts represent nearly 2% of the total stablecoin supply and will hit the market in one large wave. But this isn’t just idle money returning to passive holders. Most of these users remained in crypto through the storm. They didn’t leave—they adapted, held, and now, they’re getting liquidity back in the middle of a bullish setup. The timing couldn’t be better. Ethereum is pumping, flirting with a critical resistance level that, if broken, could confirm a major move for altcoins. Bitcoin is hovering near its all-time highs, altcoins are gaining serious traction, pro-crypto narratives are heating up in Washington, and regulatory progress is finally in motion. Everything is aligning at once. Bitblaze explains that this $5B return of capital could be the exact catalyst the market needs. In his view, this sudden injection of liquidity could send Bitcoin toward $120K—and unlock the altseason traders have been waiting for. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? Ethereum Eyes $2,700 Breakout As Altseason Momentum Builds Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,638, consolidating just below a key resistance zone at $2,700. After a sharp rally in early May, ETH has held its gains and formed a solid base above the 34 EMA ($2,331) and key moving averages. The 200-day SMA, sitting at $2,697, now acts as a critical ceiling for price action. A clean breakout above this level would mark the first major reclaim of the long-term trend line since the bull cycle resumed, potentially unlocking a powerful continuation for ETH and the broader altcoin market. Volume has remained steady throughout this consolidation phase, indicating buyer interest and positioning ahead of a decisive move. ETH’s structure shows higher lows and strong bullish follow-through, suggesting that momentum is building just beneath the surface. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? If Ethereum can close above $2,700 with conviction, it would not only confirm a breakout but could also trigger broader market rotation into altcoins. Historically, ETH breaking above major resistance levels has been a strong leading indicator for altseason. With Bitcoin hovering near ATHs and macro conditions favoring digital assets, ETH’s next move could be the spark that ignites a new wave of altcoin rallies across the board.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 789,100 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the period of altcoin underperformance against Bitcoin is almost over based on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart. The BTC.D chart tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. A bearish BTC.D indicates that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. According to Van de Poppe, altcoins are now poised to outpace Bitcoin as the BTC.D chart is flashing a bearish reversal signal on the weekly chart. “The end of the bear market (yes, a bear market on altcoins underperforming Bitcoin) is still here. Strong bearish divergence on the Bitcoin dominance, implying we’re about to reverse and altcoins about to shine. Nothing has changed.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 63.89%. Looking at Bitcoin, the trader thinks BTC will retest a key psychological area as support before rallying to fresh record-high levels. “I’m monitoring the current price action and I won’t be surprised if we’re seeing a slight correction happening on Bitcoin. Probably macro-driven or whatever reason, but I wouldn’t be surprised to build some more stamina before we continue the rally to $120,000-$130,000.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $109,112. As for Ethereum ( ETH ), the analyst says a correction toward the $2,000 price level would present a solid opportunity for long-term investors. “Similarly, I think it’s vital that, if ETH drops beneath $2,400, that will give a tremendous opportunity. Ethereum rallied from $1,800 to $2,700 in a few days. If there’s a 10-20% correction, pretty normal, great opportunity to get yourself positioned into it.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,663.

Schiff argues Bitcoin’s value stems from user belief, not fundamental attributes, unlike gold. Despite BTC’s growth (now $108,899), Schiff believes it has no sustainable future as money. Well-known American stockbroker Peter Schiff is not backing down from his stance: Bitcoin (BTC), he insists, is not money. A long-time Bitcoin critic, Schiff has consistently argued that the cryptocurrency lacks the fundamental qualities needed to function as actual money. In a recent podcast , the renowned financial analyst maintained his opinion about Bitcoin. According to Schiff, Bitcoin has other qualities and is suitable for purposes other than money. Schiff on Bitcoin: A “Collectible Token” Valued by Belief, Not Intrinsic Attribute Per Schiff’s definition, Bitcoin is a collectible token with no unique value. The analyst thinks that Bitcoin users can deploy the crypto token for trading involving buying, selling, and storing Bitcoin.

The announcement was made at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference on Wednesday at the Venetian Convention Center in Las Vegas by Bilal Bin Saqib, the special assistant to the Pakistani prime minister on blockchain and cryptocurrency. Saqib announced that Pakistan will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and never sell its BTC trove in future. Furthermore, Pakistan wants to follow in the footsteps of the United States, which intends to implement a strategic Bitcoin reserve to deal with the high debt burden. “We are getting inspired by the U.S. government. We will be holding these Bitcoins and we will never, ever sell them,” Saqib stated . What Next For Bitcoin Price Action? Bitcoin price experienced a significant resistance level above $110k in the past few days, thus resulting in the ongoing market correction. The flagship coin dropped over 2 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $107k on Wednesday, May 29, during the late North American trading session. Bitcoin price has experienced relentless bearish pressure since last Friday, despite the notable accumulation by institutional investors.

2025-05-28T23:00:44.000Z,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Boost: K33 Secures $6.22M in Strategic Funding","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Boost: K33 Secures $6.22M in Strategic Funding In a significant move signaling growing confidence in digital assets, Swedish crypto broker K33 recently announced a substantial capital raise aimed squarely at strengthening its balance sheet with Bitcoin. This development highlights a broader trend of companies exploring how digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, can serve strategic financial purposes beyond just trading. What is a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Why Does it Matter? A Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin as part of its corporate reserves, similar to how traditional companies hold cash, bonds, or gold. It’s a decision driven by various factors, often including: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about currency devaluation, some companies see Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a potential hedge against inflation. Store of Value: Positioning Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, potentially appreciating over time. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional holdings. Signal of Innovation: Demonstrating forward-thinking adoption of emerging technologies. For a company like K33, a crypto broker, adopting such a strategy aligns with its core business and can instill confidence in its customers and investors regarding its belief in the asset class it facilitates trading for. K33 ‘s Strategic Crypto Funding Explained K33, a prominent name in the Nordic crypto market, announced on its official website that it has successfully raised 60 million SEK, equivalent to approximately $6.22 million USD. This funding wasn’t from a typical venture capital round but through investment agreements with its key, long-term shareholders. The stated purpose of this capital injection is explicit: to fund the company’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. This means the raised funds are earmarked specifically for acquiring Bitcoin to be held on K33’s balance sheet. This move is strategic for several reasons: It strengthens K33’s financial position by adding a potentially appreciating asset. It demonstrates a strong conviction from its core investors in both K33’s business model and the long-term value of Bitcoin. It positions K33 as a proactive player in the crypto broker space, potentially attracting clients interested in companies with direct exposure to Bitcoin. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Investment While K33’s move is significant for a crypto broker, the concept of companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury is not entirely new. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, is perhaps the most well-known example, holding billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Other public and private companies have also allocated portions of their reserves to the digital asset. Here are a few notable examples (values are approximate and subject to change): Company Approx. BTC Holdings Estimated Current USD Value Primary Motivation (often cited) MicroStrategy ~214,400 BTC ~$13.5 Billion+ Inflation hedge, Capital allocation strategy Marathon Digital Holdings ~17,631 BTC ~$1.1 Billion+ Treasury reserve, Assets from mining Coinbase ~10,500 BTC ~$660 Million+ Corporate treasury Tesla ~9,720 BTC ~$610 Million+ Corporate treasury diversification Note: These figures are estimates based on publicly available data and market prices at a given time. K33 joining this list, especially as a dedicated crypto broker, adds another layer to the narrative of institutional and corporate adoption. It suggests that even companies deeply embedded within the crypto ecosystem see strategic value in holding the underlying asset itself, not just facilitating its trade. Implications for the Crypto Broker Landscape and Beyond K33’s decision could have ripple effects. As a regulated crypto broker operating in Europe, its move might inspire other similar firms to consider their own treasury strategies. If more crypto-native companies allocate capital to Bitcoin, it could further legitimize the asset class and potentially drive additional demand. For investors, this news from K33 provides insight into how companies operating directly in the crypto space are managing their balance sheets and expressing their long-term outlook on Bitcoin. It reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate component of corporate finance. Key Takeaways from K33’s Funding Round K33 secured $6.22 million specifically for a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The funding came from key existing shareholders, indicating strong internal support. This move reflects growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset. It positions K33 uniquely within the crypto broker market by directly holding BTC on its balance sheet with dedicated funding. The trend of corporate Bitcoin investment continues to gain traction. K33’s successful funding round for its Bitcoin treasury strategy is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic statement. It underscores the increasing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and highlights how companies, particularly those in the digital asset space, are integrating cryptocurrencies into their long-term financial planning. As the crypto market matures, expect to see more innovative approaches like this shaping the future of corporate finance.

2025-05-28T23:00:04.000Z,"Bitcoin Expert Samson Mow Reveals Why BTC Is Not Trading At $10 Million Per Coin Already","Samson Mow, a Bitcoin expert and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of JAN3, a BTC-focused infrastructure firm, has shared a striking take on the current valuation of the flagship cryptocurrency. According to Mow, Bitcoin is still far from its full potential and, in his view, should already be priced at $10 million per coin. Why Bitcoin Is Not Worth $10 Million Yet In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Mow stated, “If the world understood Bitcoin, we would be at $10 million a coin now.” This comment reflects his belief that Bitcoin’s true value is heavily undervalued and underestimated. Related Reading: Massive $200 Million Sell Wall Holds Bitcoin At $111,000 And $113,000 – Here’s What We Know For Mow, BTC is more than just a coin to trade; it is a revolutionary asset that could shake up the foundations of the current financial system. With its capped supply, decentralized nature, and consistently growing value, many even believe that BTC has the potential to act as a global reserve currency. Yet despite growing adoption and visibility, Mow argues that most people in the world, including institutions, policymakers, and retailers, still do not fully comprehend Bitcoin and its implications. According to the JAN3 CEO, this knowledge gap is what is holding Bitcoin back from achieving the massive price surge that he and many other long-term advocates anticipate. While the $10 million mark remains speculative for now, Mow’s remarks reflect a wider sentiment among Bitcoin enthusiasts who see the current price as just the beginning. For example, top Bitcoin supporters and investors like Michael J. Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, have shared similar views, predicting an explosive rise in Bitcoin’s value to $10 million by 2035. Likewise, Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO), has voiced strong confidence in Bitcoin reaching the $1 million mark. He believes this milestone could realistically be achieved within the next five years. Demand For BTC Surges Among Institutions And The Wealthy With the growing belief that the Bitcoin price will only continue to rise in the long term, social media reports indicate a significant surge in interest and demand among financial institutions and the wealthy. Notably, Saylor, one of the biggest advocates for Bitcoin, has long been accumulating the cryptocurrency in hundreds of thousands. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Rally Over After $111,900 ATH? Global M2 Money Supply Is Still Going Donald Trump, the United States (US) President, has also been a public supporter of Bitcoin, with reports revealing that he is actively buying the flagship cryptocurrency. Even investing legend and hedge fund manager Hugh Henry disclosed earlier this month that he intends to sell his $35 million house to buy $10 million worth of Bitcoin. Binance CEO Richard Teng also announced that the wealthy are showing significant interest in the leading cryptocurrency. He revealed that sovereign funds and high-net-worth individuals are now purchasing BTC like never before. This growing accumulation by institutions and the rich signals strong confidence in BTC’s long-term value and sustainability.

2025-05-28T22:45:47.000Z,"Bitcoin Price To Reach $160,000: Analyst’s Daring Prediction In Short Time Frame Shocks Investors – 80% Bonus Tokens Inside","A crypto analyst has made a bold prediction suggesting the Bitcoin price could soar to $160,000 in record time. This comes after the Bitcoin price hit new ATH levels, signaling further upward movement. While this Bitcoin price target has traders scrambling, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a rapidly growing meme coin, is recording large investments as its presale enters the second stage. Bold Bitcoin Price Target Of $160,000 Stuns Traders As Analyst Predicts Swift Rally Crypto analyst Aka Bull has predicted that the Bitcoin price could continue its bull run and hit the $155,000 – $160,000 range. Aka Bull shared that after the Bitcoin price successfully broke out of its prolonged consolidation phase, it was only a matter of time before it hit higher levels. The Bitcoin price forecast pins the next major target zone around $155,000 to $160,000, with the breakout viewed as “clean” and structurally sound. The analyst suggested that all that’s left is a catalyst, a “momentum trigger” that could accelerate the Bitcoin price climb. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) AI Vision Gathers Momentum As Presale Reaches New Levels FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers a distinctive chance with an early-stage advantage that is hard to miss. The project is now in its beta testing phase, and a strategic rollout plan featuring a zero-tax presale is underway, providing tokens at a cost of just $0.00000035 . This presents significant growth prospects for investors, as the initiative seeks to excel by being listed on major centralized exchanges. It engages in influencer promotions across X, Instagram, and TikTok to generate viral attention. Floppynomics: Incentivizing Engagement While Contributing To Real-World Causes FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) transactional structure introduces a 3% fee on all trades, intended to benefit both the ecosystem and the global community. A portion is dedicated to wildlife conservation efforts, another segment is redistributed to holders as rewards, and the rest is burned to create deflationary pressure, all within a substantial 120 trillion token supply. The initiative will support sponsorship for endangered species such as hippos and assist in habitat restoration efforts. Additionally, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) project plans to collaborate with local organizations to guarantee that its contributions yield the greatest impact in essential areas. Integrating AI Utility With Community Involvement FloppyPepe (FPPE) is establishing a smart, AI-driven ecosystem with real-world applications. Its roadmap features several advanced tools, including FloppyAI , an upcoming chatbot offering academic and professional guidance. There’s also FloppyX , a framework for user-led video creation leveraging dynamic content generation, and a Meme-o-matic AI agent for meme production. This AI-centric strategy is tailored for a tech-informed audience in search of both entertainment and utility, distinguishing FloppyPepe (FPPE) from other meme coins. Furthermore, SolidProof has successfully audited the project’s smart contract. Why FloppyPepe Could Be Your Last Chance For A 1000x Meme Coin In 2025 Given the presale price of $0.00000035 , the speculative upside associated with FloppyPepe (FPPE) is enormous, in contrast to the slow growth of many other meme tokens. Only 20% of the overall tokens are available during the presale, while 60% of the circulating supply is set aside for distribution in the early stages. If post-listing projections come to fruition and the token reaches $0.01, this could theoretically result in a return of up to one thousand percent, converting a $50 investment into $50,000. This offers a much larger gain potential compared to what altcoins can provide. The Opportunity To Invest In FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Now FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining traction in its presale. Analysts believe tokens in early stages with genuine products and clear growth strategies usually perform well, and a token’s low market cap is viewed as a strong indicator of potential triple-digit returns. Notably, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) first presale stage sold out in a few weeks, raising $2 million. The presale price, set at merely $0.00000035 , offers a final chance to invest at such a low entry cost. Take advantage of this life-changing opportunity now.

2025-05-28T22:40:40.000Z,"NFT Sales See Remarkable Rebound in May, Ending Decline","BitcoinWorld NFT Sales See Remarkable Rebound in May, Ending Decline After several challenging months, the NFT market is finally showing signs of recovery. Recent data reveals a significant uptick in activity, marking a potential turning point for digital collectibles . NFT Sales Surge: What the Data Tells Us According to reports citing CryptoSlam data, NFT sales experienced a notable rebound in May 2025. Sales figures rose by a significant 15%, reaching a total of $430 million. This increase is particularly noteworthy as it represents the first monthly rise recorded throughout 2025, following a period of five consecutive months of declining sales. This data suggests a renewed interest in the world of non-fungible tokens. Beyond just the dollar value, May also saw the highest number of transactions for the year, with 5.5 million individual sales taking place. This indicates not just higher value trades, but also broader participation and activity across the NFT market . Let’s break down the key figures from May’s performance: Total Sales Value: $430 million (a 15% increase from April) Number of Transactions: 5.5 million (the highest volume in 2025) Trend: First monthly increase after 5 months of decline Why Are Digital Collectibles Seeing Renewed Interest? The rebound in digital collectibles sales can likely be attributed to a confluence of factors. While it’s difficult to pinpoint a single cause, several elements within the broader crypto market and the NFT space itself may be contributing: Potential drivers for the May rebound include: Stabilizing Crypto Market: Often, the NFT market correlates with the performance of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A more stable or upward-trending crypto market can instill confidence in investors, making them more willing to explore riskier assets like NFTs. New Project Launches & Innovation: The continuous introduction of novel NFT projects, platforms with enhanced utility, and innovative use cases for NFTs (beyond just profile pictures) can attract new buyers and re-engage existing ones. Increased Utility and Adoption: NFTs are increasingly being integrated into gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and real-world assets. As their practical utility grows, so does their appeal. Anticipation of Market Trends: Sometimes, market activity picks up in anticipation of major industry events, technological upgrades, or shifts in investor sentiment. Understanding the NFT Market Landscape The NFT market is diverse, encompassing various categories from digital art and music to gaming assets, virtual real estate, and domain names. The May rebound likely saw increased activity across multiple segments, although specific categories or collections may have driven a larger portion of the volume. While the 15% increase is positive, it’s essential to view it within the context of the market’s historical performance. The NFT market experienced explosive growth in 2021 and early 2022, followed by a significant downturn. The current figures, while encouraging, are still far below the peak levels seen during the market’s height. This rebound could be the beginning of a gradual recovery or simply a temporary fluctuation. What Does This Rebound Mean for Blockchain Art and Creators? For artists and creators leveraging blockchain art and NFTs, this rebound is welcome news. Increased sales volume and value mean more opportunities for artists to monetize their work, reach a global audience, and benefit from features like royalties on secondary sales. The renewed activity can also encourage innovation in the creation and distribution of blockchain art . As the market matures, we may see more sophisticated artistic projects, new platforms supporting diverse media, and stronger communities forming around digital art collections. Navigating the NFT Space: Actionable Insights For those interested in the NFT space, whether as collectors, creators, or investors, the May rebound offers some insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of market data, trending projects, and technological developments within the NFT and broader crypto market . Do Your Research: Before buying or investing, thoroughly research the project, the team behind it, its utility, and its community. Understand the Risks: The NFT market remains highly volatile and speculative. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Explore Utility: Look for NFTs that offer more than just ownership – consider those with utility in games, communities, or platforms. Conclusion: A Promising Sign for the NFT Market The 15% increase in NFT sales in May 2025 is undoubtedly a positive development, breaking the streak of declining sales and injecting optimism back into the market for digital collectibles . The rise in both transaction volume and value suggests a genuine increase in activity and interest. While it’s too early to declare a full bull run for NFTs, this rebound provides a promising signal. It indicates that despite the previous downturn, the underlying interest in digital ownership, unique digital assets, and blockchain art remains. As the technology evolves and more compelling use cases emerge, the NFT market may continue to find its footing and explore new avenues for growth.

2025-05-28T22:34:28.000Z,"Pakistan to Establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, Allocate 2000 Megawatts of Energy for Crypto Mining","LAS VEGAS, Nevada — The government of Pakistan has plans to establish a strategic bitcoin BTC reserve and support bitcoin mining, the country’s Minister of State for Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib announced at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Bin Saqib said that Pakistan’s plans for a strategic bitcoin reserve were inspired by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration’s own nascent plan for a strategic bitcoin reserve in the U.S., which will — at least at first — be filled with the U.S. government’s holdings from criminal and civil forfeitures, estimated to sit at around 200,000 bitcoins. He also said that the government of Pakistan was following the U.S.’s push for stablecoin legislation, the GENIUS Act, “very carefully.” Like the bitcoins earmarked for the U.S. strategic reserve, Bin Saquib said that the Pakistani government would not sell its bitcoins. “This wallet, the national bitcoin wallet, is not for speculation or hype. We will be holding these bitcoins and we will never, ever sell them,” Bin Saqib said. In addition to setting up a strategic reserve, Bin Saqiib announced that the government of Pakistan has earmarked 2,000 megawatts of electricity for bitcoin mining and AI data centers.“We want to welcome all miners to come to Pakistan, all the infrastructure players to come to Pakistan and build with us,” Bin Saqib said. Bin Saqib said that the establishment of a bitcoin strategic reserve in Pakistan would be “just the beginning” of the country’s embrace of the crypto industry. “We have over 100 million unbanked people. They lack tools for saving, for investment, and we want to change that. We want them to break their economic classes. And I really believe that crypto and blockchain can help us take that quantum leap,” Bin Saqib said. “We want to tokenize our illiquid assets. We want to do digital IDs … So Pakistan is looking for allies. Pakistan is looking for access, because Pakistan wants to build.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/28/pakistan-to-establish-a-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-allocate-2000-megawatts-of-energy-for-crypto-mining,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Policy|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T22:30:48.000Z,"US Stock Market Rises: Positive Open Signals Emerge for Crypto Investors","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Rises: Positive Open Signals Emerge for Crypto Investors Hey crypto enthusiasts! While your focus might be squarely on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the latest altcoin moves, paying attention to the US stock market can offer crucial insights into the broader financial landscape. Today, traditional markets kicked off the trading session with a noticeable uptick. But why should you care about stock market news when you’re deep in the world of digital assets? Let’s dive in and connect the dots. What Today’s US Stock Market Opening Tells Us The opening bell on Wall Street today brought some positive numbers across the major indices. This isn’t just a random fluctuation; it reflects the collective sentiment and trading activity at the start of the day. Here’s a quick look at how the key players opened: Index Opening Change S&P 500 +0.07% NASDAQ Composite +0.17% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.04% While these percentages might seem modest, a higher open indicates initial buying pressure and potentially positive investor expectations for the trading session ahead. It sets a tone, even if temporary, for the market’s direction. Why NASDAQ Performance Often Grabs Crypto’s Attention Among the indices, the NASDAQ performance is often watched closely by the crypto community. Why? Because the NASDAQ Composite is heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks. These are often considered ‘risk-on’ assets, much like cryptocurrencies. Over the past few years, we’ve seen a significant increase in the correlation between the movements of tech stocks and major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This correlation isn’t a perfect one-to-one relationship, but it’s strong enough that significant moves in one market can often foreshadow or coincide with similar moves in the other. When tech stocks are rallying, it can signal a broader appetite for risk among investors, which sometimes flows into the crypto space. Conversely, when tech stocks tumble, it can reflect a move towards safer assets, potentially pulling crypto prices down with them. Understanding the Crypto Market Correlation with Traditional Finance The increasing crypto market correlation with traditional assets, particularly tech stocks, is a relatively recent phenomenon compared to Bitcoin’s early days. Several factors contribute to this: Institutional Adoption: As more large institutions, hedge funds, and corporations invest in crypto, they often treat it as part of a broader portfolio alongside stocks and other assets. Their trading decisions can be influenced by macro factors affecting their entire portfolio. Macroeconomic Environment: Both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions like interest rates, inflation, and central bank policies. When the cost of borrowing rises, it can impact the valuation of growth assets like tech stocks and also make riskier assets like crypto less attractive. Investor Demographics: A significant portion of investors in both tech stocks and crypto are retail investors who might follow similar trends or sentiment across different platforms. Market Maturity: As the crypto market matures and becomes more integrated into the global financial system, its price movements are increasingly influenced by external market forces rather than solely internal crypto-specific events. While correlation doesn’t mean causation, understanding this link helps crypto investors contextualize price movements that might not seem directly related to crypto-specific news. How Positive Market Sentiment in Stocks Can Influence Crypto Today’s higher open contributes to overall market sentiment . Positive sentiment in traditional markets can sometimes create a ripple effect. When investors feel optimistic about the economy and the stock market, they might be more willing to take on higher risks. This ‘risk-on’ mood can translate into increased investment in assets perceived as having higher growth potential, including cryptocurrencies. Think of it as a general tide. When the tide is rising (positive sentiment), most boats (different asset classes) tend to lift. Of course, individual factors can cause a specific boat to move differently, but the overall environment plays a significant role. Monitoring sentiment in traditional markets provides a broader gauge of investor confidence, which is a key driver for any asset class, including digital ones. Beyond the Headlines: What Stock Market News Should Crypto Investors Watch? Simply seeing that the stock market is up or down is just the surface. For crypto investors looking to understand the bigger picture, certain types of stock market news and economic data are particularly relevant: Inflation Reports (CPI, PPI): High inflation often leads central banks to raise interest rates, which can negatively impact growth stocks and crypto. Federal Reserve Announcements: Decisions on interest rates and monetary policy are perhaps the single biggest driver of macro sentiment affecting both markets. Tech Company Earnings: Reports from major tech companies (many listed on NASDAQ) can indicate the health of the growth sector, which is closely watched by crypto investors. Economic Growth Data (GDP, Jobs Reports): Strong economic data can sometimes signal that central banks might tighten policy, while weak data could suggest the opposite, both impacting market expectations. Staying informed about these key economic indicators, often reported as major stock market news, provides valuable context for anticipating potential shifts in the broader financial environment that could influence crypto prices. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Don’t Panic Sell (or Buy) Solely Based on Stock Moves: While correlation exists, crypto has its own unique drivers. Use stock market information as context, not the only basis for your decisions. Watch NASDAQ and Tech Sector Performance: Due to the higher correlation, keep an eye specifically on how the NASDAQ and major tech stocks are performing. Understand the Macro Picture: Pay attention to interest rates, inflation, and central bank commentary. These affect both markets significantly. Diversify Thoughtfully: Recognize that holding both tech stocks and Bitcoin might offer less diversification than you think due to their correlation. Conclusion: Navigating the Interconnected Markets Today’s higher open in the US stock market, led by positive moves in indices like the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow, is more than just traditional finance news. It’s a data point that contributes to the overall market sentiment and provides clues about the broader economic environment. Given the increasing crypto market correlation with assets like those on the NASDAQ, understanding stock market news and tracking market sentiment becomes a valuable part of a crypto investor’s toolkit. While crypto maintains its unique characteristics and drivers, ignoring the signals from traditional markets would be doing yourself a disservice. Stay informed, understand the correlations, but always remember the distinct nature of the digital asset space.

2025-05-28T22:17:39.000Z,"Mayor Eric Adams wants New York City to become the first city globally to issue a Bitcoin-backed bond","Mayor Eric Adams, while talking at the ongoing Bitcoin conference, has revealed New York City will be the first city in the world to issue a Bitcoin-backed bond, referred to as a BitBond. Mayor Adams emphasized his commitment to introducing what he tagged a new financial instrument and also revealed intentions to eliminate the New York BitLicense . Mayor Eric Adams says Bitcoin will flow in NYC During his speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Mayor Adams stated that the so-called BitBond would be a financial instrument for Bitcoin holders. He promised to push and fight to ensure residents of New York City can access bond investments. Mayor Adams added that their focus is now on “thinking big and being unafraid of the future,” after which he urged those listening to “come out of the shadows” and return to the city. “You no longer have to be afraid to be a part of this major industry that has been attacked, criticized, and denied the opportunity to move forward and grow,” he said. It is not surprising that Mayor Adams is championing the Bitcoin course in New York City. The mayor is famous for his pro-crypto stance, with many even referring to him as the “Bitcoin Mayor”— a befitting name for the charismatic politician who famously opted to receive his first three paychecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling his support for digital currencies. Among political leaders, his administration also stands out for making moves to integrate cryptocurrency into the city’s financial ecosystem. He has played a role in promoting initiatives to make New York City a hub for cryptocurrency, including the announcement of a digital assets advisory council aimed at boosting the crypto industry in the city. His speech at the Bitcoin conference aligns with his broader policy of fostering a crypto-friendly environment. In addition to plans to issue Bitcoin-backed bonds, he will also potentially revisit or eliminate the New York BitLicense, a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency businesses in the state. Mayor Adams announced a new digital assets advisory council for New York City Eric Adams, Mayor of New York City. Mayor Adams’ speech about BitBond comes not long after he and Chief Technology Officer Matthew Fraser hosted New York City’s first crypto summit this month. Attendees included prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the cryptocurrency, blockchain, and fintech industries. The summit convened to discuss how the growing cryptocurrency industry can boost the economy, attract top talent, and inspire innovation in New York City. In opening remarks at the summit, Mayor Eric Adams announced the development of a digital assets advisory council designed to help bring jobs and investment to New York City. “My goal remains the same as it was day-one as mayor: making New York City the crypto capital of the globe,” said Mayor Adams. “We will be creating a digital asset advisory council to bring big fintech jobs and investment right here to the Big Apple.” Mayor Adams did not share further details about the council, but he indicated that the chair of the council and key policy recommendations would be announced in a couple of weeks. “This is not about chasing memes or trends,” Mayor Adams stated. “We want to use the technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mayor-eric-adams-to-let-bitcoin-in-new-york/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TECHNOLOGY","News|BTC|United States",cryptocompare

Trump Sees Slight Approval Boost The poll showed that while Trump has a 44% approval rating from U.S. adults, 52% disapprove. Meanwhile, 46% of registered voters approve of Trump’s second term as president, while 52% again disapprove.

In particular, Vance slammed former United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler for his regulation-by-enforcement strategy toward the blockchain sector as a whole. “We prioritize eliminating the rules, the red tape, and the lawfare that we saw aimed at our crypto by our predecessors,” Vance said . “We’re ending the weaponization of federal regulations against this community.” “To put it simply, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is dead and it is not coming back under the Trump administration,” he added. $TRUMP Faces Gala Dinner Backlash The SEC has dropped several high-profile lawsuits against key players in the crypto industry in recent months, including Ripple, OpenSea, and Coinbase. The federal regulator has also assembled a Crypto Task Force to collect input from the American public and crypto community at large on how best to develop a new digital asset regulatory framework. However, Trump has faced increased scrutiny in recent weeks for his affiliations with the digital asset sector. Democratic lawmakers have cast a spotlight on ethics concerns surrounding Trump’s namesake meme coin gala dinner held for top $TRUMP investors on May 22 at Trump National Golf Club just outside of Washington, D.C. Critics claim that foreign influences may have been able to purchase the cryptocurrency in a bid to win favor with Trump, potentially violating key ethics provisions. However, with Trump Media announcing a $2.5 billion plan to buy Bitcoin on Tuesday, it seems as though Trump’s alleged connection to cryptocurrencies is doing anything but slowing down.

GameStop has announced its first investment in Bitcoin, and US Representative Bryan Steil told Cointelegraph that crypto legislation should remain free of unrelated policy provisions. BlackRock eyes 10% stake in Circle's IPO — Report BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). According to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering. Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. Circle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available. The company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.” GameStop officially confirms first Bitcoin purchase of 4,710 BTC GameStop, the US video game and consumer electronics retailer, has confirmed its first Bitcoin investment , acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin, according to a statement posted May 28 on the company’s X account. The company did not specify how much it paid for the Bitcoin ( BTC ) or when the purchases were made in the announcement , while its Form 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also offers little detail. The amount purchased was worth around $513 million at the time of writing. The announced acquisition is GameStop's first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March. At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. Source: GameStop The news comes after months of speculation that GameStop was exploring alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies . Rep. Steil wants restraint on crypto bill additions Republican Representative Bryan Steil told Cointelegraph on May 27 that he wants lawmakers to stop adding what he considers non-relevant clauses into two key crypto bills, claiming that doing so is slowing the implementation of a regulatory framework for the industry. “Individuals, when they see legislation that’s going to move forward, want to attach non-germane items to any bill that’s going to move through and be signed into law,” Steil, chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on crypto, told Cointelegraph at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

Crypto backers in Congress hope to pass stablecoin and market structure bills before a month-long August recess, which was hampered by Democrats who pulled support for the stablecoin bill earlier in May over concerns about President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures. Steil argued the concerns related to Trump aren’t relevant to the bills, and the “text is focused on putting forward a regulatory framework in which we can enforce actions to strengthen this broader market.”",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM","Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T21:49:03.000Z,"JD Vance Blasts Gary Gensler at Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Promises Full Cryptocurrency Deregulation","U.S. Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the Trump administration’s deregulatory stance toward the crypto sector in remarks at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. JD Vance Slams Gary Gensler In Fiery Remarks During his speech, Vance reaffirmed the administration’s opposition to former United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to cryptocurrencies . Vice President JD Vance Delivers Remarks at Bitcoin 2025 Conference at Las Vegas, NV https://t.co/m2IIVUS1j4 — Vice President JD Vance (@VP) May 28, 2025 “We reject regulators,” Vance said . “We fired Gary Gensler, and we’re going to fire everybody like him.” The former Senator from Ohio further claimed that the Trump administration is committed to cleaning up the “wreckage” from former U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, which saw extensive guardrails placed on the blockchain sector . “We prioritize eliminating the rules, the red tape, and the lawfare that we saw aimed at our crypto by our predecessors,” Vance said. “We’re ending the weaponization of federal regulations against this community. To put it simply, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is dead, and it is not coming back under the Trump administration.” “With President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House,” he added. Trump’s Crypto Ties Face Scrutiny Vance’s comments come just days after Trump hosted an exclusive dinner for the top 220 investors of his namesake memecoin at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C. Critics of the event argue that the gala may have violated key presidential ethics provisions, citing concerns over potential foreign influences’ ability to purchase the cryptocurrency. In a May 14 letter, three key Democratic members of the House of Representatives urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to unseal suspicious activity reports (SARs) into “politically oriented” Trump-affiliated ventures. “Because the identities of the coin purchasers need not be publicly disclosed, there is no way to tell who is buying the coin, potentially allowing bad actors, including authoritarian governments and companies they control, to enrich the Trump family,” the House members said of $TRUMP. The U.S. lawmakers have asked the requested SARs to be returned by May 30, though it remains unclear how Bessent will proceed.

2025-05-28T21:43:04.000Z,"Trump Coin Price Prediction: $100 Incoming or Full Collapse? The $3B Mystery Gets Deeper","Official Trump ($TRUMP) coin holders are on edge after Trump Media & Technology Group—the entity responsible for former U.S. President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform—denied a Financial Times report alleging plans to raise $3 billion through a combination of equity and convertible bonds for investing in Bitcoin and other cryptos. The report, published earlier this week, cites six anonymous sources familiar with the situation. The company’s response was blunt: “Apparently, the Financial Times employs clueless writers who rely on even less credible sources.” The media firm reportedly planned to raise $2 billion through equity offerings and $1 billion via convertible bonds—securities that it can later exchange for company stock. The FT also noted that the size of the capital raise remained flexible and adjustable. Impact on Official Trump Coin Price Over the past 24 hours, the Official Trump meme coin has slipped 2.2% to $12.74 — mirroring broader weakness across the crypto market, with Bitcoin down 1.7% and the total market cap retreating 3.2% to $3.54 trillion. Yet zooming out paints a more dramatic picture: since last Wednesday, TRUMP has tumbled 14%, sharply underperforming rivals like Dogecoin (down 2.5%) and even Bitcoin, which managed to climb 1% over the same period. This divergence raises a critical question — is the drop justified, or is TRUMP setting up for a rebound as political narratives regain traction in the crypto space? The Official Trump coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 48 and is trending downward — a potential signal of building selling pressure. Still, broader bullish developments such as expanding crypto adoption, regulated U.S. ETFs, and incoming clarity on crypto regulation could reshape the market in 2025. Bitcoin’s new all-time high of $111,814 on Thursday has fueled renewed optimism that a full-blown bull market may already be underway. If that momentum carries forward, TRUMP could climb back toward the $36 range — halfway to its all-time high of $73.43, reached just two days after launch on January 19. And if major project-specific developments emerge — such as high-profile partnerships or integrations — the Trump meme coin could even surge past resistance levels and make a run toward the $100 mark. Trump Slips, But BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) Powers Ahead with Explosive Presale Momentum While Trump’s coin struggled this week, one high-reward meme coin presale built for Bitcoin maxis quietly raked in thousands. Why just hold BTC—when you can earn it passively by holding the meme coin that rewards every surge? BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) introduces an innovative approach to meme tokens by offering Bitcoin payouts to holders each time BTC hits certain price benchmarks—a concept that’s generating significant buzz across the crypto space. The idea caught on quickly. Just minutes after launching, the project had secured over $100,000 in contributions, eventually raising $6.5 million within three months of presale. Currently available at $0.002535 during its presale, the token’s price is designed to increase with each subsequent round, creating strong incentives for early participation. For those seeking additional passive income streams, $BTCBULL also features a staking mechanism with annual yields reaching up to 63% APY.

2025-05-28T21:38:38.000Z,"AI Crypto Sector Grows 4x in 2 Years, Nears $20B in Market Cap","Over the past year, AI-driven projects have taken center stage in the crypto space. Currently, this sector includes 20 tokens with a collective market cap nearing $20 billion, which makes it the smallest crypto segment at just 0.67% of the overall market. To put this into perspective, the Financials sector holds a market value of about $519 billion. Grayscale attributes the AI sector’s modest size to the early stages of project development but sees significant growth potential ahead, both in absolute terms and as a share of the broader crypto ecosystem. AI Sector is Catching Up Fast Back in 2023, the total market capitalization of tokens in the AI Crypto Sector was only $4.5 billion. Since then, its value has grown over fourfold in a span of two years. Year-to-date, TAO has been the top performer among these assets with a modest gain of 2%, while ElizaOS has been the weakest, plunging by 80%. According to the latest report by Grayscale’s Managing Director of Research, Zach Pandl, and Grayscale Investments Research Analyst Will Ogden Moore, stablecoins could soon play a pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem, particularly as tools for powering AI agents, due to their programmable and efficient payment capabilities. Institutional players like Stripe, Meta, and major banks are entering the space amid improving regulatory prospects. Coinbase has also introduced a stablecoin-ready payments standard for AI. Upcoming regulatory developments, such as the crypto market structure bill and the GENIUS stablecoin bill, could further accelerate adoption. Key Trends in Decentralized AI As decentralized AI technologies rapidly evolve, Grayscale is turning its attention to other key developments, such as Bittensor’s upcoming halving and the expansion of its subnet activity. TAO, the platform’s native token and the largest AI token by circulating market cap, is modeled after Bitcoin with a hard cap of 21 million and a halving every four years, the first expected later this year. Since the dTAO upgrade launched in February, which allowed subnets to be investible, participation has surged. The report revealed that more than 7% of the circulating TAO supply is now allocated to subnets. Grayscale also identified distributed training as a particularly promising area within the AI crypto sector. Prime Intellect, for one, has shown it can train massive models and has surpassed 30 billion parameters, using a global network of idle GPUs, while moving away from reliance on centralized infrastructure. If widely adopted, this model could reduce AI training expenses and broaden accessibility. Meanwhile, projects like Prime, Gensyn, and Nous Research may introduce tokens later in the year. Grass, too, has emerged as a standout in the AI crypto space, reportedly generating tens of millions in annualized revenue from selling web-scraped data to AI labs. This positions it as a rare example of a non-financial, revenue-producing project. The network has steadily increased its data output this year, and a consumer product launch may be on the horizon. Additionally, Virtuals is also seeing strong traction, as it raked in $30 million annually from trading fees on AI agent tokens.

2025-05-28T21:37:08.000Z,"Russia records significant increase in crypto transactions due to Trump effect, the central bank says","Russian cryptocurrency transactions have seen a significant increase, and according to the Bank of Russia, the trend can be attributed in part to Donald Trump’s influence on the market. The monetary authority expects continued support for the industry from the U.S. President’s administration to further stimulate investor interest in digital assets around the world. Sizable increase in Russian crypto activity coincides with Trump’s return to power Crypto asset flows linked to Russian residents have jumped by more than 51% during the last quarter of 2024 and the first three months of 2025, compared to the previous two quarters, the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) pointed out in its latest Financial Stability Review published Wednesday. Assessing the inflows and outflows of funds initiated by Russian users on the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, the financial regulator has put the total volume of these transactions in the said period at 7.3 trillion rubles (over $91 billion at current exchange rates). Commenting on the numbers, the Bank of Russia remarked: “This may be due to the U.S. presidential administration’s policy aimed at softer regulation of the crypto assets market, which has increased interest in the market.” The authors of the study emphasize that sustained support from the current government in Washington may lead to even stronger interest in crypto assets from global investors. They also highlight some of the Trump administration’s main moves in the space, including the decree to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the acceptance of crypto ETF (exchange-traded fund) applications by the U.S. securities regulator. Among the potential risks for Russia, the CBR mentions American intentions to toughen stablecoin rules , which may threaten the activities of Russian businesses using fiat-backed cryptocurrencies like Tether in foreign trade under Western financial restrictions. The bank noted: “Strengthening the regulation of stablecoins in the U.S. will increase sanctions risks for Russian companies, including in connection with the possible blocking of tokens by their issuers.” The surge in crypto activity came despite a 0.9% drop in Russian traffic to the examined trading platforms, which saw over 165 million visits from the country during the studied quarters. Russians’ share of the total registered traffic also dropped by three percentage points to 4.5%. The Central Bank of Russia publishes its financial stability report twice annually. Its latest version does not identify the exchanges included in the analyses, the crypto page of the Russian business news outlet RBC noted. However, the previous edition released in November listed about two dozen platforms most used by Russian traders, including global leaders like Binance and Bybit, as well as some of the most popular platforms in the Russian-speaking segment of the market, such as Exmo and the sanctioned Garantex . Russians own over $10 billion in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins The Bank of Russia has based its assessments on data sourced from “Transparent Blockchain,” a specialized platform developed by the Federal Financial Monitoring Service that allows authorities to track and connect crypto and fiat transactions initiated by Russian citizens and entities. Currently, the state-controlled forensics service is used by financial intelligence units and law enforcement officers in Russia and other countries from the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ), but the plan is to also grant Russian banks access by the end of the year. Relying on information provided by the platform, the Central Bank of Russia was also able to establish that Russian wallets on the analyzed crypto exchanges had balances worth 827 billion rubles in fiat equivalent (over $10.3 billion) as of the end of March 2025. Accounting for 62.1% of the total, Bitcoin (BTC) is the most popular digital asset among Russians. The CBR recently listed the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap among the most profitable investments in the past year. Ether (ETH) ranks second with 22%, while 15.9% of the Russian digital money is held in the stablecoins USDT and USDC.

2025-05-28T21:30:23.000Z,"Ethereum Institutional Interest: Powerful Data Signals Bullish Future","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Institutional Interest: Powerful Data Signals Bullish Future Alright, let’s talk crypto! We’ve all seen Bitcoin (BTC) making headlines recently, surging past significant price levels. It’s easy to get caught up in the Bitcoin frenzy, but guess what? Behind the scenes, something interesting is happening with Ethereum. According to recent data highlighted by CoinDesk, institutional traders – the big players with deep pockets – are quietly showing a growing bullish bias specifically towards ETH. This shift in Ethereum institutional interest is backed by concrete data from futures and options markets, suggesting that while Bitcoin captures the spotlight, smart money might be increasingly looking at Ethereum’s potential. Why the Growing Ethereum Institutional Interest? You might be wondering, with Bitcoin leading the charge, why would institutions start focusing more on Ethereum? It’s a great question, and the answer lies in a combination of factors that make ETH increasingly attractive beyond just being the second-largest crypto by market cap. Ecosystem Strength: Ethereum isn’t just a coin; it’s the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a vast ecosystem of dApps. Institutions recognize the potential of this infrastructure. The Staking Yield: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), investors can earn a yield by staking their ETH. This offers a passive income stream, something traditional finance players understand and appreciate. It’s a significant draw compared to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work model. Upcoming Upgrades: Ethereum’s development roadmap includes significant upgrades aimed at improving scalability and efficiency, such as sharding. These future improvements signal long-term growth potential. Diversification: While Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold, Ethereum is viewed more as digital oil – powering the decentralized economy. Institutions seek diversification, and ETH offers exposure to a different facet of the crypto market. Relative Value: Sometimes, institutions look for assets that may be undervalued relative to their potential or compared to market leaders like Bitcoin. Data suggests they might see more upside potential in ETH at current levels based on its fundamentals and development. These factors contribute to a narrative where Ethereum is seen not just as a speculative asset, but as a technology platform with tangible use cases and potential for generating yield, which aligns well with institutional investment strategies. Decoding the Data: What Are CME ETH Futures and Other Metrics Revealing? The claim of increasing institutional bullishness isn’t just speculation; it’s supported by specific market data points, particularly those favored by institutional participants. Let’s break down the key indicators mentioned: 1. CME Open Interest (OI): What it is: Open interest represents the total number of outstanding futures or options contracts that have not been settled. On regulated exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), CME data is often seen as a proxy for institutional activity because these are the venues institutions typically use due to regulatory compliance and infrastructure. What the data shows: The article highlights that CME ETH futures open interest has seen a massive surge, rising 186% to $3.15 billion since April. This significant increase indicates a substantial amount of new capital entering the Ethereum futures market, primarily from institutional players opening new positions. A rising OI alongside price stability or increase is often interpreted as new money backing the trend. 2. Futures Premiums: What it is: A futures premium (also known as contango) occurs when the price of a futures contract is higher than the current spot price of the underlying asset. This difference reflects the market’s expectation of the asset’s future price, cost of carry, and demand for leveraged long positions. What the data shows: ETH futures premiums hit 10.5%, notably outpacing Bitcoin’s 8.74%. A higher premium on ETH futures compared to BTC suggests stronger demand for leveraged long positions in Ethereum among futures traders, including institutions. It implies traders are willing to pay a higher price for future delivery of ETH, indicating bullish expectations. 3. Risk Reversal Metrics: What it is: Risk reversal is an options trading strategy or metric that involves buying an out-of-the-money (OTM) call option and selling an OTM put option with the same expiration date. The risk reversal rate reflects the difference in implied volatility between OTM calls and OTM puts. A positive risk reversal indicates that OTM calls are relatively more expensive than OTM puts, suggesting a bullish bias (more demand for upside protection/speculation than downside protection). What the data shows: ETH’s risk reversal metrics are signaling stronger bullish sentiment compared to BTC. This means that in the options market, traders are paying a higher premium for the right to buy ETH at a higher price (calls) than for the right to sell ETH at a lower price (puts), relative to the premiums seen in Bitcoin options. This is a clear sign of increasing confidence in Ethereum’s upward potential among options traders, a market also heavily utilized by institutions. 4. Elevated Funding Rates: What it is: Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders holding long and short positions in perpetual futures contracts. When funding rates are positive, long position holders pay short position holders, indicating that longs are dominant and willing to pay to keep their positions open, reflecting bullish sentiment. What the data shows: Elevated funding rates on ETH perpetual futures further confirm rising investor confidence. Consistently high positive funding rates suggest aggressive buying pressure on the long side, which includes both retail and institutional players in the perpetual futures market. Putting it all together, these diverse data points from regulated and unregulated derivatives markets paint a consistent picture: institutions are actively positioning themselves for potential upside in Ethereum, perhaps even more aggressively than in Bitcoin right now, despite BTC’s recent price performance. Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Is Institutional Preference Shifting? For years, Bitcoin has been the undisputed king of institutional crypto adoption. It was the first, the largest, and often the only cryptocurrency considered ‘safe’ enough for traditional portfolios. We saw the launch of Bitcoin futures on CME, Bitcoin trusts, and eventually spot Bitcoin ETFs in various regions, including the US. This wave of crypto institutional adoption was primarily focused on BTC. However, the data we’re seeing now suggests a potential pivot or, at the very least, a significant expansion of focus. While institutions aren’t abandoning Bitcoin, their *marginal* interest and bullish positioning seem to be growing faster for Ethereum. This doesn’t mean ETH will flip BTC tomorrow, but it indicates that institutions are becoming increasingly comfortable with Ethereum as a distinct and valuable investment thesis. Here’s a simple comparison based on the data discussed: Metric Ethereum (ETH) Bitcoin (BTC) Institutional Bias Indicated CME Open Interest Growth (Since April) +186% ($3.15B total) Significant, but ETH growth rate higher Stronger ETH accumulation Futures Premium 10.5% 8.74% Higher demand for ETH long positions Risk Reversal (Options) Stronger Bullish Signal Relatively less bullish signal More appetite for ETH upside exposure Funding Rates (Perpetuals) Elevated Positive Positive (but potentially less elevated than ETH) Aggressive ETH long positioning This comparison clearly illustrates the tilt in positioning. Institutions aren’t just dipping their toes in ETH; they appear to be making a more committed move, viewing Ethereum as a critical component of the digital asset landscape alongside Bitcoin. What Does This Crypto Institutional Adoption Mean for the Market? Increased institutional interest in Ethereum has several potential implications for the broader crypto market: Increased Legitimacy: More institutional involvement lends credibility to Ethereum as an asset class, potentially attracting even more traditional investors. Potential for Reduced Volatility (Long Term): While initial institutional inflows can cause volatility, a mature market with significant institutional holdings can sometimes lead to more stable price action over time, as institutions tend to have longer investment horizons than retail traders. Infrastructure Development: Institutional demand often drives the development of better infrastructure, such as regulated exchanges, custody solutions, and financial products (like potential spot ETH ETFs), making the market more accessible and safer for all participants. Influence on ETH Price: Significant institutional capital flows can have a substantial impact on the ETH price , potentially driving it upwards as demand increases. Halo Effect: Increased focus on Ethereum could potentially draw more attention and capital to the wider Ethereum ecosystem (Layer 2s, DeFi protocols, etc.) and even other smart contract platforms. This growing trend signifies that the narrative around crypto is evolving beyond just Bitcoin as a store of value. Ethereum is being recognized for its utility and ecosystem, opening up new avenues for institutional investment and potentially accelerating the overall pace of crypto institutional adoption . Actionable Insights: Navigating the ETH Price Signals So, what does this mean for you, the everyday crypto enthusiast or investor? While institutional moves are powerful signals, it’s crucial to interpret them correctly and consider the risks. It’s a Bullish Signal, Not a Guarantee: The data strongly suggests a bullish bias, but market sentiment can change quickly. Institutional positioning is one factor among many influencing ETH price . Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t blindly follow institutional money. Understand the fundamentals of Ethereum, its technology, risks, and your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Consider the Long Term: Institutional investors often have a long-term perspective. Their positioning might indicate expectations over months or years, not just days or weeks. Volatility Remains: Despite institutional interest, the crypto market is inherently volatile. Be prepared for price swings. Look Beyond Price: While the potential impact on ETH price is exciting, also consider the underlying developments in the Ethereum ecosystem that are attracting this institutional interest. The increasing Ethereum institutional interest , as evidenced by key data points like CME futures and options metrics, is a significant development. It suggests that sophisticated investors are increasingly confident in Ethereum’s future, viewing it as a strategic asset in the digital economy. While Bitcoin continues to hold its ground, the spotlight is clearly expanding to include Ethereum in a major way. This trend could have lasting effects on market structure, liquidity, and potentially the long-term trajectory of the ETH price . It’s a powerful signal that Ethereum is maturing as an asset class and gaining recognition for its fundamental value and ecosystem strength.

Metaplanet To Issue More Debt For Bitcoin Metaplanet is raising more funds through another bond issue to expand its growing crypto treasury. The bonds carry no interest and have a redemption date of Nov. 27,2025, Metaplanet announced in a post on X on Thursday. The Tokyo-based investment company dubbed “Asia’s MicroStrategy” agreed to issue the debt to EVO FUND, making it the 16th such sale to date. The Cayman Islands-based investment firm has been Metaplanet’s main backer for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, subscribing to several rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds, providing capital for its Bitcoin buying blitz. Metaplanet is currently Asia’s largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder and is the 11th largest globally, as per Bitcoin Treasuries data. The firm started stockpiling Bitcoin in April 2024 after adopting BTC as a core treasury reserve asset, with a stated goal of reaching 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 . The Japanese firm has stated that its strategy is not just about “embracing digital assets, but also about pioneering a future where finance meets innovation at its core.” The debt sale announcement follows Metaplanet’s second-biggest BTC purchase, snatching up 1,004 Bitcoin worth over $100 million. This lifted the company’s Bitcoin stash to 7,800 BTC, valued at more than $800 million. Metaplanet is up roughly 20% on its Bitcoin investments. Metaplanet is notably positioning itself in the mold of Michael Saylor’s Strategy, whose aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy has encouraged an increasing number of publicly traded firms to follow suit. Strategy has accumulated around 580,250 BTC worth $62.3 billion. The timing of Metaplanet’s push into Bitcoin comes as the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency recently set a fresh all-time high of $111,814.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways: Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000. Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time. Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction. Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities. Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: X The chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors. A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months.

2025-05-28T21:21:40.000Z,"Coinbase Floats CDP Wallets to Eliminate Private Key Management","Leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has launched CDP Wallets, a new product for developers in the Web3 space. According to the reports, these wallets give users complete control without managing private keys. Notably, the CDP Wallets are secure, scalable, and easy to integrate. Benefits of Coinbase CDP Wallets This innovation also opens up new opportunities for developers of decentralized apps and crypto projects. One of the exciting features of the CDP Wallets is that they remove the need for developers to manage sensitive private keys or complicated backend systems. Instead, Coinbase CDP Wallets handle all sensitive tasks securely in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These are special pieces of hardware that provide strong security for cryptographic operations. This setup lets developers create customizable wallets using an API, ensuring that the unencrypted private keys are never exposed, even to the exchange. Other features include easy wallet creation, quick signing, and compatibility with popular developer tools like viem, wagmi, and ethers.js. Furthermore, CDP Wallets support EVM chains, Solana, and EIP-712 typed message signing for structured interactions with smart contracts. This approach allows developers to focus on building user-friendly applications instead of spending time and resources securing backend wallet systems. Coinbase Unveils Smart Wallet to Simplify Crypto Trading Recall that the exchange also launched a new smart wallet last year. The wallet is designed to tackle key challenges in the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem, making it easier for new users to get started and reducing transaction costs. As reported by TheCoinRise, the smart wallet is in sync with eight other networks like Ethereum, Base, Avalanche, and others. The smart wallet features simplify all the hurdles in getting started with crypto. Intriguingly, the Coinbase smart wallet is user-friendly and allows new users to set up and use their wallets with little effort. These advantages position it for wider adoption. Coinbase Flexibility Options Last year, the exchange also allowed users to choose between using Lightning and the Bitcoin (BTC) network when making BTC transfers. The exchange integrated a layer-2 Lightning Network to enable customers to perform BTC transitions quickly and cheaply compared to when doing them on the Bitcoin blockchain. Analysts say Coinbase’s new smart wallet and recent initiatives demonstrate the exchange’s commitment to enhancing user experience. The smart wallet’s user-friendliness is seen as a unique selling point. Ultimately, the wallet will help Coinbase expand its services in the competitive cryptocurrency market.

2025-05-28T21:15:24.000Z,"Qubetics Gains $17.5M Traction as Pi Coin Coils and Ethereum Retests—This Trio Tops the Crypto to Invest in for Short Term","Is your crypto portfolio ready for the Next 1,000% ROI candidate? A technical ripple is sweeping across the digital finance arena, and this time it isn’t just about Bitcoin dominance catching attention overnight. Qubetics ($TICS), Pi Coin, and Ethereum are pulling serious weight on the charts. Ethereum is pressing near resistance with crucial price levels in sight, Pi Coin is tightening into a breakout-ready triangle. This week isn’t business as usual—it’s positioning time for those tracking the top crypto to invest in for short term. While Ethereum and Pi Coin refine the tools already in circulation, Qubetics ($TICS) enters with utility-centric firepower, promising real-world interoperability—the kind needed in global logistics, identity access, smart cities, and digital banking infrastructures. It doesn’t merely enhance blockchain; it patches long-standing operational inefficiencies. Early buyers are betting on the functional future, not just flashy performance. Qubetics : Real-World Interoperability Solved Qubetics ($TICS) is engineered as a modular blockchain protocol that bridges operational inefficiencies between existing decentralized networks. It’s not just about scalability or throughput—it brings true interoperability. That means seamless cross-chain communication across healthcare systems, decentralized ID verifications, and even digital remittances without costly delays. In real terms, think of autonomous toll systems exchanging data with digital driver’s licenses across chains, or decentralized banks verifying KYC credentials from multiple networks in milliseconds. Qubetics does not require reconfiguring base layers—it simply slots in, like middleware, to unify fragmented data environments. That makes it particularly compelling as the top crypto to invest in for short term, especially for those watching real-world problem-solving potential. Now at Stage 36 of its crypto presale , Qubetics has already raised over $17.5 million. With more than 27,200 token holders and over 514 million $TICS sold, momentum isn’t slowing. At its current price of $0.3064, projections show a possible ROI of 226% at $1 and up to 4,795% at $15 post-mainnet. That kind of upside has community members scrambling to reserve positions before stage 37 opens. Few projects offer this blend of advanced tech and grounded market use. Pi Coin: A Quiet Build Before the Surge Pi Coin (PI) is crafting something subtle—but that’s where the tension lies. The asset is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern between $0.748 and $0.804, with indicators tightening like a coiled spring. The RSI floats near 47.91, MACD reads 0.00782, and Bollinger Bands are primed for expansion. These aren’t just metrics—they’re signals. The market’s preparing for movement, and community participants are watching the triangle’s apex like a countdown. Analysts suggest a breakout could lift Pi Coin by as much as 20%, targeting resistance at $0.8486 and possibly even breaking the psychological $1.0003 threshold. The bullish outlook isn’t just hypothetical—it’s supported by historical data. Every previous Pi consolidation this narrow preceded a sharp directional move. Timing is everything. Those eyeing the top crypto to invest in for short term need to monitor Pi Coin’s technicals closely. Ethereum: Bullish Retest or Decline Incoming? Ethereum (ETH) is testing waters near $2,640, brushing against its critical resistance at $2,724. Sunday’s retest of its 200-day EMA at $2,451 acted as a springboard, helping ETH rebound by 5%. But traders are wary—this is the third approach to the resistance without a clean breakout. The RSI currently stands at 66, just shy of overbought, and pointing downwards. The MACD’s bearish crossover suggests a potential stalling of upward momentum. If Ethereum fails to close above $2,724 in the coming sessions, price could decline toward its next support at $2,247—right at the 50-day EMA. But a break above $2,724 would pave a route to $3,000, a psychologically significant level. For those seeking the top crypto to invest in for short term, Ethereum’s next move could either trigger a rapid rally or offer a key re-entry point on pullback. Momentum plays are all about timing, and right now, Ethereum is balancing on that edge. Choosing the top crypto to invest in for short term: Strategic Diversification Each protocol covered—Qubetics ($TICS), Pi Coin, and Ethereum—offers distinct value within today’s fast-shifting digital finance environment. Ethereum provides institutional credibility and a robust smart contract ecosystem, though it teeters near key resistance. Pi Coin presents an elegant technical formation likely to erupt soon, perfect for those who favor momentum trades. But Qubetics ($TICS) is the standout for functional growth—its interoperable infrastructure and cross-chain capabilities unlock real-world use cases that are often overlooked in speculative markets. The momentum in Qubetics’ presale reflects more than hype. It shows alignment between advanced tech and practical deployment. Those who understand that utility drives longevity are watching this project for more than short-term gains—they’re tracking adoption readiness. Don’t miss the current stage price of $0.3064, because once Stage 37 kicks off, the path to a 1,000%+ ROI narrows with each tick. Conclusion: The Right Timing for the Right Token Timing isn’t just important in crypto—it’s everything. Ethereum’s next candle could define market structure. Pi Coin may surge on a triangle breakout. But Qubetics ($TICS), with over $17.5 million raised and unmatched real-world use potential, offers a layered opportunity for those seeking the top crypto to invest in for short term . Its ongoing crypto presale could end up being the digital world’s version of getting in before the roads were paved. For those seeking high-potential projects with tangible value, the time to act is now. Visit the Qubetics official site and secure $TICS before the next stage re-prices access. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics considered one of the top crypto to invest in for short term? Because of its strong interoperability features, high presale traction, and real-world utility that addresses longstanding blockchain inefficiencies. What makes Pi Coin’s symmetrical triangle pattern significant? This pattern indicates a narrowing of price volatility, which often precedes a breakout. Traders anticipate a major move soon. Is Ethereum a risky option right now? Ethereum is trading near a critical resistance level. A breakout could lead to a rally, but rejection may signal short-term decline.

2025-05-28T21:13:46.000Z,"Leading AI Claude Predicts the Price of XRP, Pi Coin, and Pepe by End of 2025","The Claude AI chatbot appears to be almost as knowledgeable about crypto and altcoins as ChatGPT. With Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high last week, many believe the market could be on the verge of a new bull cycle. With that in mind, we asked Claude which cryptocurrencies its most looking forward to. In order to get a sense of the projects the AI genuinely values, we had to ask it which projects have the best fundamentals. So, we took three of the hottest coins right now and asked it to rank them on this metric. XRP: The Project Claude AI Names as the Most Likely Contender Ripple’s XRP , the flagship token behind the company’s blockchain-based payment system, remains at the forefront of the digital finance revolution because, like Claude AI says, it has the strongest fundamentals for steady growth. It recently secured a vote of confidence from the United Nations, which acknowledged its potential role in facilitating a global digital payments network with regulatory oversight. Adding to its momentum, former U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that XRP could be incorporated into a proposed Strategic Crypto Reserve as a “hold-only” asset (ie, the US government can hold confiscated $XRP but cannot buy it)—a development that’s placing the coin squarely on the geopolitical radar. Despite following Bitcoin’s recent price corrections, XRP has shown resilience, holding firm around the $2 support level and eyeing a possible breakout past the $3 resistance by mid-year. With favorable market trends and growing legitimacy, XRP may be on the verge of a catalytic upswing, according to Claude AI. Pi Network ($PI): A Novel Take on Crypto Mining with Explosive Price Potential Pi Network is turning heads as a user-friendly blockchain project that introduces a simple tap-to-earn model. Launched in February 2025, the $PI token surged 40% in the first two weeks of May, in a whale-assisted recovery rally that ebbed a little shortly afterward. Although currently undergoing a minor 3.3% intraday correction—its RSI sails at a neutral 48—suggesting the market is pricing this one fairly. Claude AI calls this one a wild card, but if its team can flesh out the ecosystem, many believe it could surpass the $3 milestone in a couple of months. Unlike traditional mining, Pi requires no advanced hardware. Users simply open the app and tap a button once per day to mine tokens, making it highly accessible and appealing to casual users. This innovative model, combined with Pi Network’s Layer 1 architecture, could make it a standout performer in the months ahead. Pepe ($PEPE): The Meme Coin That Spawned a Frog-Fueled Movement Rooted in the legacy of Matt Furie’s internet-famous frog, Pepe ($PEPE) has become a cornerstone of meme coin culture and a wealth generator for early adopters. It has consistently ranked among the top three meme coins since late 2024. Since its debut in April 2023, Pepe has ignited a trend of frog-themed tokens, though none have matched its impact or performance. Currently priced near $0.0000136, $PEPE has risen 58% in the past thirty days, making it easily the best performing among the coins named here throughout May—XRP and Pi actually lost value. With a market cap of roughly $5.7 billion, it is the biggest non-doge-themed project among meme coins. Despite this momentum, it remains 51.5% below its December 2024 peak of $0.00002803. However, technical charts show a potential breakout from a descending wedge pattern that formed between November and March. Analysts anticipate that this could lead to a new all-time high by late summer as trading volume and optimism continue to rise. MIND of Pepe ($MIND): Where Meme Culture Meets AI Innovation in a Bot More Useful than Claude for Crypto Fans Blending viral internet iconography with cutting-edge artificial intelligence, MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is carving out a unique niche in the meme coin ecosystem. While cosmetically inspired by the legendary Pepe meme, its true strength lies in functionality—offering users an AI-powered assistant that delivers live crypto market insights, sentiment analysis, and behavioral data. The MIND AI assistant recently made its debut on X (formerly known as Twitter), where it now engages directly with the community and shares frequent market updates. Ten Million. $MIND pic.twitter.com/yVFKn23P8H — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 23, 2025 Supported by a robust $10.9 million in initial funding, the $MIND token also includes a high-yield staking feature with returns of up to 215% APY, positioning it as a top-tier option for earning passive income within the crypto space. Analysts speculate that once MIND of Pepe ($MIND) secures listings on major exchanges, it could approach the $1 mark, representing an astonishing potential surge of 26,556% from its current valuation. This places it among the most lucrative opportunities in the meme token sector.

2025-05-28T21:01:33.000Z,"U.S. Department of Labor Reverses Crypto Guidance, Opens Door for 401(k) Bitcoin Exposure","Key Takeaways: The Trump administration has eliminated regulatory barriers that previously discouraged employers from offering cryptocurrency options in workplace retirement plans. The prior guidance warned employers to use “extreme care” and launched investigations into plan sponsors offering crypto options. Despite the change, crypto remains rare in 401(k) plans; fewer than 1% include digital assets, according to a 2024 GAO report. The U.S. Department of Labor has rescinded a 2022 policy that discouraged the inclusion of cryptocurrency in workplace 401(k) plans, as stated in a news release on May 28. The reversal marks a major policy shift, indicating a return to a neutral regulatory stance and potentially reigniting interest in crypto investment options for retirement accounts. Labor Dept. Ends ‘Extreme Caution’ Guidance on Crypto in 401(k) Plans The earlier guidance , issued under the Biden administration, warned employers to exercise “extreme care” before offering digital assets like Bitcoin in employee retirement plans. It also introduced an “investigative program” directed at sponsors who offered crypto through direct menus or self-directed brokerage windows. That approach had a chilling effect on adoption, causing some firms to rethink plans to add crypto options. The reversal announced on May 28 by the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration said the 2022 guidance had overstepped its bounds. JUST IN: US Labor Department rescinds 2022 guidance that warned fiduciaries against including crypto in 401(k) plans. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) May 28, 2025 According to the agency, the guidance conflicted with the department’s legal obligation to remain neutral on investment choices offered in retirement plans. “The Biden administration’s Department of Labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” said Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not DC bureaucrats.” The change may reopen the door for firms like Fidelity, which had begun exploring crypto offerings for 401(k)s before the previous policy took effect. However, the broader financial industry has shown limited enthusiasm for alternative assets in retirement accounts. Crypto remains rare in 401(k) plans. A 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office found that fewer than 1% of defined-contribution plans included digital assets, with only 69 crypto-based investment options available nationwide. Critics argue that retirement accounts should focus on stable, long-term investments, not volatile assets like Bitcoin. The crypto industry, meanwhile, maintains that digital assets democratize access and offer new opportunities for everyday investors. ForUsAll Inc., the first U.S. crypto 401(k) recordkeeper, had tried and failed to overturn the Biden-era guidance in court last year. A federal judge ruled that reversing the policy would not revive the company’s business. The Labor Department says it will neither endorse nor disapprove specific assets. Fiduciaries remain responsible for assessing whether crypto, or any other investment, is appropriate for their plans. U.S. Regulators Loosen Crypto Restrictions, Paving Way for Broader Institutional Adoption The Department of Labor’s reversal on crypto restrictions is the latest in a wave of federal rollbacks reshaping how digital assets are treated across the U.S. financial system. Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, his administration has taken a markedly pro-crypto stance . Trump himself has openly embraced the industry, launching a meme coin, $TRUMP, and announcing plans to build a Bitcoin treasury through his media company. Federal agencies have followed suit. For example, in March, the FDIC rescinded its 2022 policy requiring banks to seek prior approval before engaging in crypto-related activities. The @FDICgov revised its crypto policy, letting banks engage in digital asset services without prior approval. Oversight continues through post-notification reviews. #CryptoRegulation #FDIC https://t.co/lOsoTfKKtN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 29, 2025 The updated guidance, FIL-7-2025, permits FDIC-supervised banks to offer crypto services, provided they manage associated risks and adhere to safety and soundness standards. While banks must notify the agency, prior approval is no longer required. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also relaxed restrictions in March , allowing national banks and federal savings associations to engage in crypto custody, stablecoin activities, and distributed ledger participation without needing supervisory nonobjection. Acting Comptroller Rodney E. Hood said the shift reflects the agency’s improved understanding of crypto and its plan to foster responsible innovation. In April, the Federal Reserve joined the pivot, withdrawing 2022 and 2023 guidance that discouraged state banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin operations, indicating a coordinated regulatory shift favoring digital assets in 2025.

Russia’s heightening partnership with the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) is steering a rapid move away from the U.S. dollar. Sergey Ryabkov, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister, recently emphasized the push for using local currencies and advancing non-dollar financing as part of Moscow’s bid to loosen Western financial dominance. Western sanctions, intensified after each escalation, restrict Russian access to global markets, technology, and finance, damaging sectors like energy exports and banking. https://t.co/5BDXUP4Pyv — Amir Hemati (@realamirhemati) May 26, 2025 BRICS members, led by NDB’s Dilma Rousseff, view sanctions as roadblocks to trade and development; however, the shift towards multipolar finance could boost demand for Bitcoin. As traditional financial systems face skepticism, more countries and investors may turn to Bitcoin as a borderless, impartial alternative, driving both interest and price growth. India’s Tax Reforms Could Supercharge BTC Adoption Optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s possible return has sparked a push for crypto tax cuts in India.

Moreover, lower taxes have the potential to attract millions of new users. It can drive increasing Bitcoin adoption and potentially drive up prices. However, confusion over crypto regulations and outdated laws still pose hurdles. If India’s government embraces these changes, Bitcoin could strengthen its position as a leading global financial asset. Bitcoin Chart Patterns Show BTC’s Reversal Potential Technically, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bearish amid BTC’s recent breakdown from a symmetrical triangle, suggesting short-term bearishness; however, the setup remains promising. Price action near the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $107,060 shows indecision, with spinning top candles suggesting a pause. Support zones around $105,900 and $104,256—where higher lows were established—could offer a solid base for a rebound. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A closer look at the MACD reveals a bearish crossover and deepening histogram, but a bullish divergence might emerge. If a bullish engulfing or three white soldiers pattern forms near support, a rally could ignite. The EMA 50 trends downward but hovers near price, hinting that a break above $108,200 could drive a move toward $109,631 or even $111,935. Trade Setup: Consider a cautious long entry around $106,000–$105,900 if reversal patterns and MACD signals align. Set stops below $104,200, with initial targets at $108,200 and $109,600. A decisive reclaim of $107,000 would signal momentum, but failure could see a dip to $104,256.

Today, I announce the Pakistani government is setting up its own government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and we want to thank the United States of America again because we were inspired by them.\"" The announcement represents a significant departure from the government of Pakistan’s previous stance on cryptocurrencies, holding that crypto would never be legal in the country. Pakistan’s shift reflects the broader trend of nation-states adopting pro-crypto policies following the regulatory shift in Washington, DC under the President Donald Trump administration.

Several initiatives were proposed by the Council, including using runoff energy to mine BTC or data centers, and accumulating BTC for a national treasury. In May 2025, the Council announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts of excess energy to Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing data centers. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao is one of the Council’s advisers . Appointed in April, the executive will advise on crypto regulations, blockchain infrastructure, and the adoption of digital assets. Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance protocol, signed a letter of intent on April 27 to help the country to tokenize real-world assets, build DeFi architecture, and experiment with crypto products. More recently, in May 2025, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance commissioned the establishment of an entirely new agency to oversee digital asset regulations in Pakistan. The Digital Asset Authority will oversee the regulation of crypto platforms and issue licenses to digital asset providers operating in the country.

2025-05-28T20:51:11.000Z,"As Miner Revenues Rebound to $50M+/Day, TeraHash Prepares to Unlock Mining Yields for Over 8 Million Users","Bitcoin has officially broken through the $117,000 mark the other day – its strongest rally in months, reigniting interest not only in price speculation but in the infrastructure behind the scenes: mining. As the most popular cryptocurrency surges again, miners have stepped up operations, sending daily exchange inflows to nearly 50 BTC per day, a sharp rise from the 25 BTC daily observed earlier this quarter. While still below historical peaks of 100 BTC/day, this doubling in activity signals renewed confidence among miners – and capitalizing on this trend, investor appetite is following closely. According to recent data, cumulative miner earnings have climbed back to $51.6 million per day, up significantly from local lows and showing potential for further upside. Again, while not yet at the all-time highs of $80 million/day, the current numbers underscore a robust post-halving rebound, and an increasingly competitive market for Bitcoin yield. Amid this backdrop, TeraHash , the soon-to-launch protocol built by one of the industry’s largest mining players, is stepping into the spotlight. Designed to provide simplified access to Bitcoin mining-based rewards, TeraHash removes the need for hardware, hosting contracts, or complex infrastructure. Backed by 8 million early users from its viral Telegram-based mining game HashCats, the protocol is now positioning itself to become one of the largest tokenized mining network in crypto. It offers a hardware-free, on-chain alternative just as global interest in mining surges again. In recent days, that promise has quietly turned into conversation – with growing chatter across Telegram, X, and Discord fueling curiosity and pulling more eyes toward what might be one of the most unconventional protocol launches this cycle. The Low-Key Start to What Might Become the One of the Largest Bitcoin Mining Protocol Amid the flood of Telegram bots, stickers, and trading alpha groups, mini-apps took off in 2024. What started with simple “tap-to-earn” games, like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat, quickly evolved into a new kind of onboarding funnel. With nothing but a few taps, tens of millions of users were interacting with crypto mechanics, often without even realizing it. Some games were speculative, some were just memes, but one of them, HashCats , laid the groundwork for something bigger. This mining-themed simulation, launched in mid-2024, where users upgraded cartoonish rigs, optimized power usage, and managed reward cycles, all while competing for yield with digital cats. But beneath the memes and mechanics was something far more ambitious: a stealth onboarding funnel into one of the most capital-intensive sectors in crypto – Bitcoin mining. Within months, HashCats exploded to over 8 million users, making it one of the most viral mini-apps of the Telegram era. But unlike typical Web3 games, HashCats didn’t just build engagement — it seeded understanding. Players simulated halvings, optimized hashrate, and learned mining dynamics. Behind the scenes, a real mining infrastructure was being assembled. That infrastructure now has a name: TeraHash. The Logic Behind TeraHash’s Simpler Approach to Bitcoin Mining TeraHash offers a different path to mining : access rewards without ever owning a rig. At the heart of the protocol is $THS, a tokenized unit representing 1 terahash per second (TH/s) of live, protocol-operated hashrate. Instead of navigating hardware lead times or energy contracts, users simply acquire $THS and stake it on the platform to get rewards from mining. No machines. No hosting. No downtime. But TeraHash also introduces a second asset, $HASH, born from the HashCats ecosystem, designed to deepen network participation through governance and a clever rewards redistribution mechanism: when users forget to stake their $THS, idle rewards are distributed among those staking $HASH in solo staking format or dual staking together with $THS tokens. Infrastructure With Proof, Not Promises Unlike earlier attempts at tokenized mining, TeraHash commits to verifiability. The team has announced plans for quarterly audits, public dashboards, and proof-of-hashrate attestation, ensuring the number of circulating $THS tokens does not exceed the live hashrate under protocol control. This move aligns with growing scrutiny around transparency in Bitcoin mining, especially as large-scale operations increasingly intersect with ESG debates, sovereign policy shifts, and grid impact concerns. In a recent example, Texas mining hubs reported up to 20% of grid participation during peak hours, renewing calls for both regulatory oversight and more transparent accounting from mining protocols. TeraHash aims to stay ahead of this curve by embedding trust at the protocol level, where every token is verifiably backed, and every reward is traceable on-chain. Bitcoin Mining Could Significantly Evolve in the Months Ahead With its July launch fast approaching, TeraHash is positioning $THS as a new programmable utility token, akin to how ETH represents staking. The team has publicly committed to targeting $5 billion worth of tokenized mining power over the next three years, signaling ambitions not just to participate in the mining market, but to reshape how it’s accessed. Integration efforts are already underway, with discussions around DeFi collateralization, dual-staking models, and wallet-level mining exposure. In essence, TeraHash is launching a token and laying the groundwork for a programmable mining layer, one that could plug directly into the rest of crypto’s capital flows, at the same time. For the 8 million who started by clicking on cartoon cats, and for the many more watching Bitcoin miner revenues rise again, TeraHash represents something new: a way into mining that’s not gated by geography, capital, or kilowatt contracts – just code, tokens, and transparent infrastructure.

2025-05-28T20:50:44.000Z,"Urgent: Bitcoin Options Show Bearish Sentiment as Bitcoin 2025 Kicks Off","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Bitcoin Options Show Bearish Sentiment as Bitcoin 2025 Kicks Off Are you watching the cryptocurrency market closely? As the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference gets underway, a notable shift is occurring in the derivatives space, specifically within the Bitcoin options market. Recent analysis indicates that traders are adopting a cautious, if not outright bearish, stance. This sentiment is particularly interesting given the historical tendency for major events to inject volatility into the market. What’s Driving the Bearish Sentiment in Bitcoin Options? According to Adam, a respected macro researcher at Greeks.live, the mood among Bitcoin options traders is currently leaning bearish. His observations, shared on the social platform X, highlight a preference for put options, which are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell Bitcoin at a specified price by a certain date. An increase in demand for put options relative to call options (which bet on price increases) is a classic indicator of bearish sentiment . Traders seem to be anticipating increased volatility around the Bitcoin 2025 conference. Large industry events often serve as catalysts for significant price movements, and it appears options traders are positioning themselves to potentially profit from or hedge against a downside move. Adam noted that many traders are not only holding bearish put positions but are also planning to increase them, suggesting conviction in their outlook. Why is Bitcoin 2025 a Potential Catalyst? The Bitcoin 2025 conference is a major gathering for the crypto community, bringing together developers, investors, companies, and enthusiasts. Historically, such events can lead to: Major Announcements: New product launches, partnerships, or regulatory discussions could significantly impact market perception. Increased Attention: The event draws mainstream and institutional focus, potentially increasing trading volume and price swings. Shifting Narratives: Discussions at the conference can reinforce or challenge existing market narratives, influencing trader psychology. While these factors could theoretically push the price in either direction, the current positioning in the Bitcoin options market suggests a bias towards preparing for a potential downturn or significant turbulence that favors those betting on lower prices. Expert Insights and BTC Price Prediction The analysis from Greeks.live provides a snapshot of this market positioning. Adam’s report underscores that this isn’t just retail speculation; it reflects the sentiment among potentially larger players in the options market. This kind of insight is crucial for understanding the short-term dynamics influenced by sophisticated trading strategies. Interestingly, alongside the general bearish tilt in options, there are specific BTC price prediction points being discussed. Some traders reportedly predict a potential surge first, perhaps reaching highs around $120,000, before a significant correction down to the $102,000 level. This indicates that the bearish view isn’t necessarily a belief in an immediate crash, but rather an expectation of a volatile period that might include an initial peak followed by a notable dip. This ‘up-then-down’ scenario is common in volatile markets and highlights the complex strategies employed by options traders who can profit from movement in either direction, or specifically hedge against unexpected turns after a potential peak. Further reinforcing the cautious outlook, Adam mentioned that algorithmic trading reports also show a slightly bearish outlook. Algorithmic trading systems often rely on quantitative models and historical data to execute trades, and their current positioning suggests that technical indicators or patterns are aligning with a less optimistic near-term view for Bitcoin’s price action. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Analysis What does this crypto market analysis mean for you as a participant? The dominance of bearish sentiment in the options market, especially tied to a major event like Bitcoin 2025, signals a period of potential heightened volatility and uncertainty. It’s a strong reminder that even during periods of potential excitement or bullish long-term outlooks, the short-term market can be heavily influenced by hedging and speculative strategies in the derivatives space. Key takeaways from this analysis include: Options Market as a Bellwether: The options market can offer insights into how sophisticated traders are positioning themselves for future price movements and volatility. Event-Driven Volatility: Major conferences like Bitcoin 2025 are often associated with increased market activity and potential price swings. Conflicting Signals: While some predict potential highs like $120,000, the dominant options positioning is defensive or bearish, anticipating a correction. Algorithmic Confirmation: The slightly bearish stance from algorithmic trading adds another layer to the cautious outlook. For traders and investors, this period necessitates careful risk management. Understanding that a significant portion of the market is braced for potential downside or high volatility is crucial. It might be a time to re-evaluate position sizes, set stop-losses, or explore hedging strategies if you hold significant spot positions. In conclusion, the commencement of Bitcoin 2025 coincides with a distinct shift towards bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin options market. Analysis from sources like Greeks.live points to traders favoring puts and preparing for volatility, potentially involving an initial price surge followed by a correction, aligning with some specific BTC price prediction targets. This comprehensive crypto market analysis underscores the need for vigilance and strategic planning as the market navigates this potentially turbulent period driven by event-specific expectations and sophisticated trading plays.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry.

These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined.

Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower.

In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738.

The failure of a bullish setup may trap the aggressive bulls, sinking the pair to $2,323 and below that to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been trading between the moving averages, indicating a lack of aggressive buying or selling.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($2.33) and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61.On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA opens the gates for a rally to $2.65. Buyers will have to drive the pair above $2.65 to catapult the price to $3.BNB price predictionBuyers pushed BNB (BNB) above the $693 resistance on May 27 but could not sustain the higher levels.BNB/USDT daily chart.

If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the pair could swing between $153 and $180 for some time.A break and close above $180 signals the resumption of the up move.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved.

When the price crosses above the EMA range, it often leads to further gains. When the price closes below the EMA range, it tends to follow deeper losses. SUI lost this support, roughly between $3.34 and $3.59, last week after a $200 million exploit hit Cetus, a decentralized exchange built on the Sui blockchain.Related: Sui validators vote on $162M Cetus recovery plan to restore user fundsNow that SUI has reclaimed the zone, bullish sentiment is returning, according to NebraskanGooner.He wrote:“As long as it can hold Gooner EMA support, it can retest ATHs. Depending on market conditions — it even has a chance for a new ATH.”SUI’s current record high is around $5.36, roughly 40% above the current prices. Fibonacci retracement levels and SUI’s prevailing ascending channel setup project $7.56 as the new record-high target, up over 100% from the current levels.SUI/USD daily price chart.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe relative strength index (RSI) has climbed to 47 from 31 on April 8, indicating that bullish momentum is building up.However, to sustain the ongoing recovery, XRP’s price has to first hold the support at $2.20 and then overcome the resistance between $2.60 and $2.80.Several analysts are optimistic about a rebound higher, with pseudonymous trader Cryptowzrd saying that a validation of a falling wedge could see XRP break out toward $2.90.“$XRP closed indecisively and is still maintaining a falling wedge formation,” the trader wrote in a May 28 post on X, adding: “A breakout of this wedge will push markets toward the $2.80 resistance.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing.

2025-05-27T22:34:00.000Z,"Ethereum price target shifts to $3K after SharpLink adopts ETH ‘treasury strategy’","Key takeaways:SharpLink Gaming establishes the first ETH treasury, backed by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin. SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity. Although average daily fees on the Ethereum chain have stayed above $1 million since May 9, 2025, fees remain significantly lower compared to Q1 2024, as highlighted in the chart.Ethereum total value locked (TVL) and chain fees.

Ether OI has increased by 72% over the past month, reflecting heightened trader activity.Ethereum open interest chart. Source: CoinGlassEther prices are also up 4.50% for the day, and Maartuun, a community analyst at CryptoQuant, indicated the likelihood of a leveraged-fueled pump for the altcoin. Over the past 30 days, Ether prices have gained 48%, with the markets exhibiting 10 leverage-driven pump signals. The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point. This projects a target range of $3,100–$3,200, aligning with prior resistance levels around $3,100 and $3,400.Ethereum 1-day chart.

An RSI near 70 indicates strong momentum, with the indicator resetting after oscillating in the overbought region(above 70), suggesting the altcoin could be gearing up for a fresh rally. Anonymous crypto trader mo_xbt pointed out a “sandwich setup” for Ethereum.

2025-05-27T21:52:14.000Z,"Growing BTC reserve requires Congressional legislation — VanEck exec","Building a permanent US strategic Bitcoin reserve would likely require targeted legislation rather than executive action, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets, Matthew Sigel. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years.
