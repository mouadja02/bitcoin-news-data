2025-05-29T04:54:20.000Z,"US Court Blocks Trump’s Tariffs, Arthur Hayes Says ‘Buy Everything’","President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs have been struck down by the US Court of International Trade , which ruled the sweeping trade measures illegal and outside the president’s authority. The Trump administration immediately filed a notice that it was appealing the ruling . On Wednesday, the court in Manhattan ruled in favor of Democratic-led states and a group of small businesses that argued Trump had wrongfully invoked an emergency law to justify this part of economic policy. Recent trade negotiations by the US have not only roiled global equity markets but have also had a significant impact on Bitcoin as well. Asian Markets Open in Green, US Stock Futures Surge Global financial markets have experienced sharp fluctuations since Trump unveiled extensive tariffs on April 2, with some measures later eased or reversed amid ongoing negotiations between the White House and foreign governments . Though Bitcoin remained mostly unchanged, Asian stock markets climbed on Thursday morning, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 gaining roughly 1.67% and Australia’s ASX 200 posting modest gains. India’s Nifty and Sensex also opened in green. Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures surged following a favorable court decision. Arthur Hayes Issues “Buy Everything” Signal Reacting to the US Court striking down Trump’s liberation day tariffs, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes posted on X, “buy everything round dos,” issuing a buying signal to investors. Hayes also made a case for Bitcoin reaching $1 million at the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vega s in a keynote speech on Wednesday. Buy everything round dos. pic.twitter.com/VDPxGFYczX — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) May 29, 2025 Arthur pointed out how the $4 trillion stimulus injected into U.S. markets from 2020 to 2021 helped propel Bitcoin’s price from $3,800 to $70,000, driven by supply constraints from ETF demand and long-term holdings. He argued that the projected capital injection through 2028, which is double that of the post-COVID period, combined with shrinking Bitcoin supply, creates a strong macro environment where reaching $1 million per BTC is not only possible but likely.

K33 said on May 28 that it secured financing through convertible loans and a new issue of shares and warrants, which “will be used in full to acquire Bitcoin in order to establish the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy.” Warrants are zero-interest securities that investors can later convert into equity at the same price. K33 could purchase up to 57 Bitcoin ( BTC ) at BTC’s current price of just over $108,000. Source: K33 K33 CEO Bull Jenssen posted to X on May 28 that he thinks Bitcoin will be the “best-performing asset in the coming decade,” and his company will “accumulate as many as possible while unlocking powerful operational synergies with our brokerage operation.” “Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build you own? Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028. The remaining 15 million Swedish krona ($1.5 million) will come through a new share issuance and warrants, according to K33. If investors convert their warrants before March 2026, they are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate. If fully exercised, K33 could raise up to 75 million Swedish krona ($7.7 million) for its Bitcoin buy . Bitcoin treasury part of expansion plans In K33’s interim report for the first quarter, released May 28, Jenssen said K33 is working with other Bitcoin treasury companies in the Nordics and hopes to use its treasury as a foundation to offer new services, such as BTC-backed lending . “For K33, Bitcoin is not only a high-conviction asset — it’s also a strategic enabler. With a sizable BTC reserve, we will be able to strengthen our financial position while unlocking new revenue streams, product capabilities, and partnerships,” he said.

In a May 28 Bloomberg TV interview , Behnam sided with the crypto industry on its long-standing argument that cryptocurrencies are commodities. “If you look at existing law, the few largest tokens are commodities, which means the SEC does not have jurisdiction over those tokens, which include Bitcoin and Ether,” he said. He added that the Securities and Exchange Commission currently cannot properly regulate crypto because its law doesn’t allow it to regulate commodities, and the CFTC cannot regulate because it is a derivatives regulator. Without new authority for the CFTC to regulate “cash markets in digital assets, non-securities,” this will remain an unregulated space, he claimed. Rostin Behnam on Bloomberg TV. Source: Bloomberg Behnam comments amid increasing scrutiny of the Trump family’s crypto ventures, which include the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, memecoins and a stablecoin. On May 28, American political strategist and political commentator Sanders Townsend said Donald Trump is boosting his family’s investments in cryptocurrency and “is using the presidency to do it.” The administration’s involvement in the regulatory process and legislative effort is “raising red flags” among some members of Congress, and there are “well-baked rules” for any elected or appointed government official that need to be complied with, he said. “Ultimately, until we do something, the [crypto] market will remain unregulated. Customers, investors, retail and institutional, will be more vulnerable to harm, fraud, manipulation and conflicts of interest, until the market is regulated.” Regulation critical to financial markets, says Behnam Behnam also weighed in on Vice President JD Vance’s speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, backing up the need for crypto regulations. Related: Trump’s use of presidential seal at memecoin event raises legal questions Vance said in a speech at the event that “we reject regulators” and that crypto “has a champion” in the White House. “Regulators are extremely important,” Behnam said. “They’re the reason American markets are the most desired in the world.” “Consumer protections and enforcement of the law are extremely critical to the health of our financial markets,” he added.

2025-05-29T04:01:20.000Z,"El Salvador Secures IMF Deal, Retains Bitcoin Holdings Amid Fiscal Changes","El Salvador and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have reached a staff-level agreement on the first review of the country’s 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. The agreement is pending approval by the IMF’s Executive Board and is dependent on the implementation of agreed-upon conditions. Progress and Fiscal Reforms According to a joint statement from IMF officials Rodrigo Cubeddu and Luis Torres, El Salvador’s early performance under the program has been strong. The country has met key fiscal and reserve targets while steadily advancing governance and financial resilience reforms. “The authorities have made significant progress in implementing their economic reform plan under the IMF-supported program. Most program targets set for the first review were comfortably met, and implementation of the structural benchmarks is progressing well,” said the officials. They added that the nation’s economy continued to expand, supported by investor confidence and resilient remittance inflows. The statement also emphasized the importance of maintaining momentum on fiscal consolidation and structural changes to address macroeconomic imbalances and support sustainable growth. Under the deal, El Salvador will continue its fiscal tightening measures. These include cuts to the public wage bill, restrained current spending, and upcoming civil service and pension system updates. The efforts will be supported by the upcoming Fiscal Sustainability Law, with the government also planning to increase deposits at the country’s central bank to boost external reserves. IMF Doubles Down on Bitcoin Stance Despite the progress, the IMF reiterated its concerns about El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy. It stated that efforts were being made to ensure the government does not add to its BTC holdings. “On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the statement read. Additionally, steps are underway to phase out public sector involvement in the Chivo wallet by the end of July. In December 2024, the two parties struck a $1.4 billion deal that included conditions to limit the nation’s crypto-related activities. The deal required BTC’s acceptance in El Salvador’s private sector to remain voluntary and restricted public sector involvement in related transactions. These conditions were later integrated into national policy through amendments to the Bitcoin Law approved by El Salvador’s Congress. The IMF Executive Board then approved the financing deal in February 2025, allowing an initial disbursement of $120 million, subject to approval. Despite the required limitations on crypto engagement, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office has continued its strategy of buying one BTC per day. As of May 28, 2025, the country holds approximately 6,190 BTC, valued at around $675 million. President Nayib Bukele has also publicly stated that cryptocurrency remains a central part of his vision for the nation.

2025-05-29T04:00:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest – Is A Second Wave Coming?","Recently, Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980 on Binance crypto exchange, surpassing its previous ATH of $108,786 recorded in January 2025. However, this rally is missing a crucial element that has historically fuelled sustained bull markets – retail investor participation. Bitcoin Rally Low On Retail Interest According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, retail activity during the current BTC rally is notably subdued. This is unusual, as fresh ATHs typically draw significant attention from smaller investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? The analyst shared the following chart highlighting this trend. It shows that BTC transfer volume in the $0 to $10,000 range – a proxy for retail demand – has only seen a slight uptick, even as prices surge. While Bitcoin’s price has been climbing steadily (white line), the 30-day percentage change in retail demand (green line) has remained largely flat. This indicates that the current momentum is likely driven by institutional investors, with retail participants yet to join in meaningfully. Recent developments support this view. For instance, institutional heavyweight Strategy continues to increase its BTC holdings, now closing in on the 600,000 BTC mark. Historical patterns – particularly from the 2020–2021 bull run – suggest that while institutional accumulation often kicks off a rally, retail investors are typically the fuel that propels it to sustained highs. Without significant retail volume, the current rally may lose steam. Concluding, the CryptoQuant analyst stated that for BTC to continue its price expansion, a clear uptick in retail participation is necessary. They added: We’re seeing early signs of movement, but it’s not yet a breakout. If retail volume kicks in over the next few weeks, new ATHs may just be the beginning. Predicting BTC’s Next Move Recent flows from crypto exchanges show that BTC reserves are dwindling at a fast pace. For instance, US-based exchange Coinbase recently saw a new outflow of 7,883 BTC, raising speculations of institutions loading up on the apex digital asset before its next leg up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Elevated Unrealized Profits Without Signs Of Panic Selling – New ATH Soon? Similarly, technicals point toward BTC hitting another ATH soon. The top cryptocurrency by market cap recently broke out of a double bottom pattern on the hourly chart, fuelling hopes of a surge toward the $112,000 mark. Meanwhile, whale behavior has been mixed. While short-term whales have taken profits, long-term holders remain steadfast, showing minimal signs of selling. That said, BTC’s medium-term outlook remains overwhelmingly positive, with some researchers predicting a $200,000 price target by the end of 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $108,802, down 0.6% in the past 24 hours.

Bilal bin Saqib , head of the Pakistan Crypto Council, revealed the initiative at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. While addressing a packed audience, Saqib credited the US for leading the way. “Today is a very historic day,” he said. “I announce the Pakistani government is setting up its own government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. And we want to thank the United States of America again because we were inspired by them.” Today, rewrites history.

It also did not specify how much Bitcoin would be held. However, Saqib made it clear that the holdings are not meant for speculation. “We will be holding these Bitcoins and we will never, ever sell them,” he said. Pakistan Reverses Course on Crypto as Global Momentum Builds Just two years ago, Pakistan’s finance ministry declared that cryptocurrencies would never be legalized. Since then, global attitudes toward digital assets have shifted. As a result, that position has softened considerably in 2025. Countries including the US, under President Donald Trump, have moved to embrace blockchain, influencing Pakistan’s change in stance. Now, Pakistan’s pivot is part of a broader national strategy. Notably, the formation of the Pakistan Crypto Council earlier this year marked a major step in building out the country’s crypto infrastructure. Led by Saqib and advised by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao , the council aims to drive blockchain innovation and expand the use of stablecoins and decentralized finance within Pakistan’s financial systems. WLF Agreement, Federal Budget Plans Show Pakistan’s Crypto Focus In April, Pakistan signed a Letter of Intent with US-based World Liberty Financial . The crypto firm is backed by financial interests linked to former US President Donald Trump’s family. The agreement outlines collaboration on asset tokenization, stablecoin development and DeFi regulatory frameworks. It followed high-level meetings with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Army Chief General Asim Munir and senior WLF executives. Further, the government has also committed 2,000 megawatts of power for crypto mining and AI infrastructure. This move is expected to support large-scale digital operations. In addition, a legal framework for digital asset regulation is currently being developed. It is likely to be introduced in the upcoming federal budget. Taken together, these efforts reflect a strategic national push. With 25m active crypto users and an annual transaction volume of $300b, according to Chainalysis, Pakistan is working to establish itself as a credible player in the global crypto landscape.

2025-05-29T03:39:13.000Z,"HTX DeepThink: Rotation Signals Emerging—Crypto Credit and InfoFi Poised as New Market Focal Points","As May draws to a close, the crypto market continues its upward momentum, fueled by a renewed wave of macro liquidity. Bitcoin demonstrates resilience, with improved on-chain capital structure and a steady rise in risk appetite. High-beta assets and quality altcoins are drawing increasing attention, signaling an emerging rotation trend. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research explores the evolving potential and structural value of crypto credit and InfoFi as key sectors in this next phase. Structural Shift Under Macro Support: Bitcoin Holds Firm as Altseason Builds Momentum As of May 21, 2025, the Federal Reserve’s net liquidity has rebounded to 6,022.869, recovering strongly from its early-May low. Although it has not yet reached the key range of 6,100–6,200, this trend signals an initial return of liquidity, providing macro-level support for the crypto market. Despite last week’s long-bond auctions disappointing on both sides of the Pacific—with the U.S. 20-year yield pushed above 5 %, and Japan’s long-end rates setting 25-year highs—stoking global liquidity-squeeze fears, the impact is somewhat mitigated. The U.S. Treasury is primarily absorbing cash mainly via 3- to 6-month T-Bills, which tends to drain money-market funds rather than risk assets. Furthermore, the Fed retains the ability to pause quantitative tightening (QT) or open its repo facilities at will, capping potential spillover effects. Bitcoin has held firm. Spot ETFs continue to post modest daily inflows, over 70 % of Bitcoin supply has remained dormant for six months or more, exchange balances are falling, and Asian/Middle-East buyers continue to buy dips. Even if net Treasury issuance jumps to roughly $1.25 trillion in Q3, short-dated supply and repo backstops dilute the drag on high-beta assets, while ETF passive holdings and “hard hands” diffuse selling pressure; a weaker-dollar narrative adds further support. On-chain data shows that public chains like Solana and Base are seeing sustained increases in activity, with capital gradually shifting from BTC-dominated safe-haven assets to high-beta altcoins. BTC Dominance remains elevated and has not yet experienced a significant pullback, but if it drops below 52% in the coming sessions, coupled with further liquidity expansion, a new altcoin season could kick off. Analysis on Trending Sectors Wall Street Doubles Down on Crypto Credit: Maple Becomes the Institutional Capital Gateway Cantor Fitzgerald has launched a Bitcoin-collateralized credit program with a total size of $2 billion. signaling Wall Street’s formal and large-scale entry into the crypto credit market. Initial recipients of this facility include crypto broker FalconX and the decentralized lending protocol Maple Finance. FalconX has already drawn over $100 million under this framework, and Maple Finance has completed its first loan issuance through the program. The $SYRUP token , associated with Maple Finance, is available on HTX through spot trading, perpetual futures, and earn products. Since its spot listing, $SYRUP has surged by 110%, with strong performance also seen in derivatives—underscoring growing market recognition and investor confidence in the project. Maple’s newly launched syrupUSDC/USDT perpetual institutional credit pool offers 8–12% annual yields with high collateral transparency, rapidly attracting large volumes of idle institutional stablecoins. This month, the TVL surged from $800 million to $1.3 billion—markets are “voting with their feet,” fully validating the appeal and growth potential of the SYRUP model. InfoFi Rising Star: $COOKIE Poised to Trigger the Next Revaluation Cycle Based on current on-chain trends and macro liquidity data, $COOKIE is expected to be on the verge of explosive growth within the InfoFi sector. Compared to similarly positioned projects like Kaito, CookieDotFun’s current market cap is just one-fifth. Once the Cookie leaderboard, ad slot bidding, and other InfoFi monetization mechanisms go live, $COOKIE’ valuation ceiling could be lifted. HTX has launched COOKIE/USDT perpetual futures , while KAITO —previously featured in the HTX DeepThink column—has also been listed on HTX , with a remarkable 138% gain over the past 30 days. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

Uncertainty about the economic outlook looms The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on May 6 and 7, released on May 28, stated, “the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proves to be more persistent while the outlooks for growth and employment weaken.” The Fed had decided after its meetings in early May to keep interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, with the minutes revealing the reason was due to “a further increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and a rise in the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation.” Riot Platforms (RIOT) closed the May 28 trading day down 8.32%, CleanSpark (CLSK) tumbled 7.61%, and Mara Holdings closed down 9.61%, according to Google Finance data. MARA Holdings bounced back 2.56% in after-hours trading.

The S&P 500 declined 0.56% over the trading day. Tension between Trump and the Fed It comes after recent tension between US President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve, following Trump’s public criticism of the Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. On April 17, Trump said, “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Related: Bitcoin sags below $108K as rate-cut bets evaporate before Fed minutes The crypto market remained relatively stable over the same period. Bitcoin is down 0.90% over the past 24 hours, trading at $107,942 at the time of publication. Bitcoin is down 2.06% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap Market sentiment also improved, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbing three points to 74, moving further into “Greed” territory. The next Federal Reserve interest rate decision is set for June 18, with 97.8% of market participants expecting rates to remain unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

2025-05-29T03:00:43.000Z,"Bitcoin Set For 50%+ Move Within 6 Months, Says Hedge Fund Boss","Bitcoin is currently changing hands just above $108,000, consolidating after Tuesday’s fresh all-time high. Charles Edwards, founder of the digital-asset hedge fund Capriole Investments, believes that price could be at least 50% higher by November. In his latest market note, “Saddle Up,” released on 27 May, the manager argues that a rare confluence of macro, technical and on-chain factors has created “the most bullish technical setup we could ask for for Bitcoin at all-time highs.” Bitcoin 50% Rally Is “Conservative” Edwards first set the stage for the call in late April, when Bitcoin was trading near $93,000. “We noted the bullish Bitcoin setup and expectation to be ‘pushing new all-time highs quite soon’,” he recalled. One month later the market has risen 16%, validating that view and, in Edwards’s telling, clearing the decks for the next leg higher. Central to the thesis is what Edwards dubs the “Hard Asset Era.” A breakout in the Gold-to-S&P 500 ratio above its 200-week moving average signals that investors are again favouring scarce stores of value over equities. Historically, such regimes are “sticky,” he writes, adding that the ensuing outperformance of gold over stocks has ranged from 150% to 650% in past cycles. “If you think gold has already rallied a lot, think again,” Edwards said. On that analogue, Bitcoin — which tends to lag gold by several months — could be poised for even steeper gains. Related Reading: US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief Recent policy changes have underpinned the rotation. Basel III rules elevated gold to Tier-1 reserve status in 2022, forcing banks to back paper positions with physical metal, while last year’s approvals of spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds opened institutional flood-gates to the cryptocurrency. Washington’s creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in early 2025 provided an additional layer of state-level legitimacy. Against the same backdrop, persistent inflation, tariff frictions and the precedent of freezing Russian foreign-exchange reserves have catalysed demand for politically neutral assets. Bitcoin Technicals And Fundamental From a market-structure standpoint, Bitcoin’s April slide to $75,000 and sharp recovery above $90,000 is described as a text-book “fake-out” — a failed breakdown that often precedes powerful upside trends. The weekly close reclaim above $90,000 “marked the start of a new trend,” Edwards contends, making the $104,000 level the first line of defence. “As long as price is above $104K, this is the most bullish technical setup we could ask for,” he wrote, reducing near-term risk management to a single number. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock Capriole’s machine-learning-driven Bitcoin Macro Index, which blends more than 100 on-chain, macro and equity-market variables, continues to register in “bullish growth.” Apparent demand (production minus dormant supply) has turned positive, US liquidity remains supportive, and Capriole’s new “Volume Summer” metric shows trend-confirming expansion in trading activity. Taken together with the historical three-to-five-month lag between gold breakouts and Bitcoin rallies, the firm argues that “a 50 %-plus rise over the next six months is a conservative target.” Policy Wild-Cards The clearest threats to the projection lie on the policy front. Edwards highlights a 30- to 60-day window for the United States to strike tariff compromises with China and the European Union; failure could dent risk appetite. He also warns that the flourishing “Bitcoin-treasury arbitrage” — whereby corporates issue low-cost debt to accumulate BTC — could amplify downside in a future deleveraging, though leverage levels remain manageable for now. For the moment, however, the combination of a hard-asset bull cycle, confirmed technical strength and improving fundamentals keeps Capriole “very optimistic about the mid- to long-term potential for both gold and Bitcoin.” As long as the market holds above that $104,000 weekly pivot, Edwards suggests investors should — in his own closing words — “saddle up.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,005.

2025-05-29T02:15:21.000Z,"Qubetics Might Be the Last Presale You’ll Regret Not Joining—Like SUI","The cryptocurrency ecosystem is experiencing another major shift. With Bitcoin stabilizing above critical resistance zones and Ethereum showing renewed strength, early buyers are recalibrating portfolios and aggressively seeking undervalued opportunities. In the aftermath of SUI’s meteoric rise, many find themselves reflecting on missed chances. The window to early entry has closed, and the market’s attention is shifting. In this new wave of momentum, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged not just as a promising presale—but as a technology platform purpose-built to resolve the persistent issues that hindered earlier blockchain projects. While SUI advanced the architecture of high-throughput Layer 1s, Qubetics delivers real-world applications through interoperability, decentralization, and unmatched user flexibility. With a presale that has already raised over millions, the narrative is clear: this project is quickly becoming the most popular cryptocurrency among informed adopters. Qubetics: A Strategic Entry into Practical Web3 Innovation For those who missed SUI, Qubetics offers a rare opportunity to enter at the ground level of a project engineered for real-world adoption. Positioned as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics brings cross-chain interoperability, a user-centric non-custodial wallet, and advanced transaction capabilities into one seamless ecosystem. Currently in its 36th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $17.5 million in contributions. The token, priced at $0.3064, has drawn widespread attention due to its strong performance metrics and expansive roadmap. Over 514 million $TICS have been sold to a rapidly growing community of over 27,200 holders—clear evidence of market confidence. At the heart of Qubetics lies its multi-chain, non-custodial wallet application—designed for professionals, businesses, and everyday users who require flexibility, speed, and control over their digital assets. This wallet allows seamless asset management across various blockchains without requiring multiple interfaces or custodial intermediaries. A digital design agency accepting global payments can simplify accounting by aggregating multi-chain revenues in a single dashboard. There’s no need for constant wallet switching or managing several DeFi apps. One of the most compelling aspects of Qubetics lies in its wealth-building potential. With $TICS currently priced at $0.3064 during the presale, projections for post-launch returns are turning heads across the investment community. If $TICS reaches $1, early participants could secure a return on investment of 226%. Should the token climb to $5, the ROI surges to 1,531%. At $6, that jumps to 1,858%, while a $10 valuation would represent an astonishing 3,163% return. And if $TICS hits $15 following the mainnet launch, early holders could see a remarkable 4,795% ROI. Investing in $TICS at this stage isn’t merely speculation—it’s securing a position in the backbone of tomorrow’s decentralized web. Qubetics addresses the usability gap left by earlier platforms and positions itself as the most popular cryptocurrency for practical Web3 deployment. SUI: A Breakthrough with Limited Access SUI, developed by Mysten Labs, introduced an advanced Layer 1 blockchain architecture that utilized the Move programming language and parallel transaction execution. Its design offered significant scalability improvements and real-time finality—ideal for decentralized applications in gaming, DeFi, and NFTs. The launch was widely anticipated and gained substantial traction, particularly among developers seeking new, high-performance chains. For builders, this means longer timelines. For early buyers, it introduces uncertainty and missed compounding opportunities. This scenario has become familiar: a groundbreaking concept launches, early access is limited, and by the time the broader market is onboard, the upside potential has largely diminished. It’s a pattern that defines many most popular cryptocurrency projects in hindsight. Conclusion: An Opportunity That Demands Action History rewards those who act with foresight. While SUI delivered exceptional performance, many were excluded from its earliest and most profitable stages. Qubetics presents a fresh opportunity—with advanced technology, a clear roadmap, and significant backing. The next most popular cryptocurrency is unlikely to resemble the last. It will solve new problems, unlock new efficiencies, and deliver returns to those who recognize its value early. Do not allow another opportunity to pass by unnoticed. Participate in the Qubetics presale, evaluate its utility, and secure a position before the narrative changes again. This is a rare convergence of timing, technology, and upside potential. And for those who take action now, the rewards may be transformative.

2025-05-29T02:01:04.000Z,"XRP Price Prediction Today: A Dip Below $2 Could Be Next","The post XRP Price Prediction Today: A Dip Below $2 Could Be Next appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The price of XRP, much like the rest of the crypto market, is facing a short-term pullback. On the daily time frame, XRP has been losing momentum as Bitcoin cools off, and since most altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead, XRP is no exception. When Bitcoin dips or moves sideways, altcoins often react with sharper drops, and that’s exactly what’s happening now. Bitcoin dominance is currently quite strong, which means Bitcoin is holding its value better than many altcoins. This puts added pressure on coins like XRP, which are now struggling to stay above important support levels. Recently, XRP slipped below a key support area around $2.30. Is There a Bullish Pattern Forming? With this level lost, analysts are now keeping a close eye on the next important zone, which sits between $2.10 and $2.15. If XRP fails to hold here, the next significant level to watch would be around $2.00, and below that, there’s some support near $1.80. Interestingly, there’s a bullish setup forming on the daily chart. There are early signs of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is a classic reversal formation that could hint at a bigger move to the upside. Short-Term Outlook However, for this pattern to actually play out, XRP would need to stabilize somewhere in the lower $2 range, likely between $2.00 and $2.15, before bouncing back towards $2.62. A confirmed breakout above this higher level would be a strong bullish signal, possibly opening the door to new highs. But for now, this pattern is only a possibility and not confirmed. In the shorter time frames, XRP has also lost a bit of positive momentum. A short-term bullish divergence recently failed as the price and RSI both made lower lows, canceling out the divergence. This signals the potential for further downside in the immediate term, with the next likely stop being around the $2.10 area.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-today-a-dip-below-2-could-be-next/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T02:00:05.000Z,"Bitcoin Diamond Hands Are Buying Again, Here’s Why It’s Bullish For The Market","Bitcoin has spent the last five days trading within a relatively narrow range between $106,229 and $111,807, following its recent all-time high of $111,814. Despite the increase in selling pressure from miners after the all-time high, the price of Bitcoin has managed to hold above $108,000, with on-chain data showing Bitcoin diamond hands absorbing all the selling pressure. Long-Term Holders Accumulating With Minimal Spending According to data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Spending Binary Indicator has fallen to its lowest level since September 2024. This interesting trend was initially noted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst Alex Adler Jr. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next The 15-day moving average of this metric, as shown in the chart by CryptoQuant, has dropped to the minimal spending zone. Notably, this zone has consistently preceded a more bullish move in the Bitcoin price. In parallel, long-term holder supply has risen by approximately 300,000 BTC over the past 20 days. This marks a deviation from the trend of declines in the long-term holder supply since 2024. At the time of writing, 14.6 million BTC, representing about 74% of the total current circulating supply of BTC, is in addresses classified as long-term holders. This pattern suggests that so-called “diamond hands”, i.e., investors with a strong conviction who hold through volatility, are not only refraining from selling with Bitcoin’s recent new peak, but are actively accumulating. The chart below shows the correlation between minimal LTH spending and rising price action, a behavior that also aligned with phases of Bitcoin’s uptrend in 2019, late 2020, and late 2024. Why It’s Bullish For The Market The significant uptick in long-term holder supply, combined with minimal selling activity, reveals a hidden strength in the market. The current behavior of long-term investors also indicates their confidence in Bitcoin’s valuation at current levels, despite the recent price surge. Many of these long-term holders are in substantial profit, yet still choose to hold. This is unlike short-term holders, who have collectively realized over $11.6 billion in profits over the past month alone. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Drawing a parallel with historical data, the current decline in long-term holder (LTH) spending mirrors a similar pattern observed in September 2024. At that time, the LTH Indicator was in the minimal zone, and the long-term holder supply was also increasing steadily. What followed was a remarkable 96% surge in Bitcoin’s price, rising from approximately $54,000 to peaks around $106,000 in December and January. If the market were to follow a similar trajectory from the current price level, a comparable 96% rally would see Bitcoin rise to a new peak near $212,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,000.

2025-05-29T01:56:37.000Z,"Nvidia posts mixed Q1, predicts $8B hit with US chip curbs","Chip-making giant Nvidia has posted mixed results in its first quarter earnings, beating Wall Street expectations on revenue but missing predictions on its income amid US restrictions on its exports to China. In earnings released May 28 for its first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year ended April 27, Nvidia reported revenues of $44.1 billion, up 12% from its previous quarter and 69% from a year ago and beating Zacks analyst estimates of $42.91 billion by nearly 2.7%. However, the chip maker posted an earnings per share of 81 cents, missing analyst estimates of 85 cents per share. Nvidia recorded a net income of $18.8 billion, up 26% compared to a year ago. In an earnings call, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said that the “global demand for Nvidia’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong” as countries start recognizing “AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet.” Source: Nvidia “AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate,” he said. US export rules to deliver $8 billion hit Nvidia said the lower-than-expected income resulted from a $4.5 billion charge due to the US government’s restrictions on exporting its high-powered H20 artificial intelligence chips to China. In its outlook for its Q2 results, the company said it expects revenues around $45 billion, which “reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations.” Nvidia will reportedly launch a new lower-cost AI chip specifically for China, with mass production expected to start in June. Nvidia’s data center revenue accounted for most of the firm’s total revenues, hitting $39.1 billion, up 10% from the previous quarter. Related: El Salvador works with Nvidia to develop sovereign AI infrastructure Shares in Nvidia Corp (NVDA) closed trading on May 28 down 0.51% at $134.81 but rallied 4.89% after the bell on its results to $141.40, according to Google Finance.

They shared this bullish outlook during a discussion on stage at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Don Jr. anticipated that Bitcoin could trade from $175,000 to $150,000 after Eric joked that the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market value could soar “to the moon” by the close of next year . Eric said that every day, people put billions and billions of dollars into Bitcoin. He forecasted that 0.1 Bitcoin would be worth an absolute fortune, adding that demand for the digital asset overtook supply. Saylor urges Trump’s family to invest in Bitcoin Don Jr. and Eric have become strong supporters of the crypto industry . They are involved in various crypto projects, such as the World Liberty Financial DeFi project and an American Bitcoin mining company. Moreover, most recently, Nasdaq-listed Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind Truth Social and Truth. Fi revealed its plans to raise $2.5 billion to launch a Bitcoin treasury. American Bitcoin is also “staking sats” as part of a plan to boost its “Bitcoin per share” metric, which it uses to calculate the value of Bitcoin treasury companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Meanwhile, World Liberty intends to introduce a stablecoin. Don Jr. stated that they are actively working on all these projects, bearing in mind that crypto is for the long term. He further stated that this was a major focus for them. Eric revealed that Saylor was helping the Trump family transition into “crypto magnates.” At one point, Saylor had tried to convince the Trumps — with whom he has been family friends in New York for a long time — to mortgage the Mar-a-Lago property so they could use the money to buy Bitcoin. Eric mentioned that Saylor told them to follow his lead, urging them that there was an amazing chance of getting Bitcoin. He then admitted that he had never seen anything like this in any other field where a major leader is actually encouraging talented individuals to challenge them. Bitcoin reached a greater height on May 22, closing at $111,390 after briefly rising to a high of $112,000. The milestone capped a 45% surge in early April when Bitcoin was traded at around $76,450. Based on CoinMarketCap reports, Bitcoin is trading at $108,105.47, reflecting an approximately 1% decrease in the past 24 hours. Eric says everyone wants to be associated with Bitcoin Eric observed in his daily experiences with the Trump organization that he is seeing more institutions create strategies for holding Bitcoin, including royal families and private offices. He mentioned that just a year ago, fewer than 100 companies were likely treasuring Bitcoin, and now this has changed. Following this, he stated that this trend is not limited to America. It includes the entire Middle East, Africa, and all of Asia. Based on his argument, everyone wants to be associated with Bitcoin and not to part with it. Eric further highlighted that his interest in cryptocurrency was strengthen after he experienced some difficulties with the traditional financial system, including the process of being debanked. “All of my accounts just stopped working,” he said. “Then you start to see how corrupt the system is… it was used to be against people.” “I don’t like using the word hate, but I can’t think of a better word,” he added, before admitting that he would like to see some of the big banks vanish entirely, because, in his opinion, they really ought to.

2025-05-29T01:30:43.000Z,"Circle IPO: BlackRock Makes Strategic Cryptocurrency Investment Move","BitcoinWorld Circle IPO: BlackRock Makes Strategic Cryptocurrency Investment Move Hey everyone, got some potentially huge news coming out of the finance and crypto worlds! The word is that BlackRock , the absolute giant in asset management (we’re talking trillions under management here), is eyeing a significant stake in the upcoming Circle IPO . This isn’t just any company; we’re talking about Circle Internet Financial, the issuer behind the widely used USDC stablecoin. What’s Happening with the Circle IPO ? According to reports, citing a Bloomberg story via Unfolded, BlackRock plans to snap up a substantial 10% chunk of the shares Circle intends to issue during its initial public offering on the U.S. stock market. This is a major signal from traditional finance towards the digital asset space. Here are some key details being reported about the IPO: Issuer: Circle Internet Financial (known for the USDC stablecoin) Planned BlackRock Stake: 10% of shares issued Expected Price Range: Between $24 and $26 per share Fundraising Target: Approximately $624 million Market: U.S. Stock Market This move highlights the growing intersection between Wall Street and the crypto economy, particularly focusing on regulated entities like Circle. BlackRock ‘s Increasing Presence in Crypto This isn’t BlackRock’s first foray into the crypto space, but it’s certainly one of the most direct endorsements of a crypto-native company’s public offering. BlackRock has been increasingly active, notably launching a highly successful spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) earlier this year. Their interest in Circle and USDC demonstrates a broader strategy to engage with various facets of the digital asset ecosystem beyond just Bitcoin. For a firm of BlackRock’s size and influence, a 10% stake isn’t just a passive investment; it could signal a strategic partnership or a deep belief in Circle’s business model and the future of stablecoins. It positions BlackRock even more firmly as a key player in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment . The Significance of USDC and the Stablecoin Market Circle’s primary product is USDC , one of the largest and most regulated stablecoins globally. Stablecoins are crucial bridges between traditional fiat currency and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. They are used for trading, lending, payments, and as a safe haven within the crypto market. BlackRock’s investment interest validates not only Circle as a company but also the critical role that regulated stablecoins like USDC play in the financial system. It suggests that major traditional finance players see stablecoins as a legitimate and necessary infrastructure for future financial transactions and cryptocurrency investment strategies. Consider the implications: Validation: A stamp of approval from the world’s largest asset manager. Liquidity & Stability: Potentially increases confidence and usage of USDC . Regulatory Confidence: Suggests BlackRock is comfortable with Circle’s approach to regulation. Bridging TradFi & DeFi: Further connects traditional finance with decentralized finance applications that heavily rely on stablecoins. Why This Cryptocurrency Investment Matters A cryptocurrency investment of this magnitude from a firm like BlackRock into a company like Circle during its IPO is a landmark event. It signifies the continued maturation of the crypto market and its integration into the global financial system. It’s not just about the money being raised; it’s about the trust and legitimacy being conferred by one of the most respected names in finance. This could pave the way for other major institutions to look at direct investments in crypto infrastructure companies, not just the assets themselves. It underscores a broader trend: digital assets, including stablecoins, are becoming an undeniable part of the financial future, attracting serious capital from the traditional world. Looking Ahead: Implications for TradFi and Crypto The potential BlackRock investment in the Circle IPO has ripple effects. For Circle, it could mean a highly successful IPO, increased visibility, and potentially future collaborations with BlackRock. For BlackRock, it deepens their footprint in the digital asset space and positions them strategically in the stablecoin market. For the broader crypto market, it’s a vote of confidence that could attract more institutional interest and capital. It reinforces the narrative that regulated and compliant crypto companies are appealing investment opportunities for even the most conservative financial players. While this is still a plan and subject to the IPO’s successful execution, the intention itself speaks volumes about where the smart money sees future growth. In Conclusion BlackRock’s reported plan to acquire 10% of Circle’s IPO shares is a monumental development. It’s a powerful signal of institutional confidence in Circle, USDC , and the stablecoin market as a whole. This strategic cryptocurrency investment from the world’s largest asset manager further blurs the lines between traditional finance and the digital asset space, highlighting the increasing mainstream acceptance and integration of crypto infrastructure.

2025-05-29T01:20:16.000Z,"Momentum: JD Vance Predicts 100M Bitcoin Holders, Champions Pro-Crypto Policy","BitcoinWorld Momentum: JD Vance Predicts 100M Bitcoin Holders, Champions Pro-Crypto Policy The world of cryptocurrency is constantly buzzing with predictions and political discourse, and a recent appearance by JD Vance , the U.S. Vice President, at the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas certainly added fuel to the fire. Vance didn’t mince words, offering a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and a clear stance on the future of crypto policy in the United States. Why Does JD Vance See Crypto as a “Ground-Up Innovation”? Speaking before a crowd of crypto enthusiasts and industry leaders, JD Vance characterized cryptocurrency, and particularly Bitcoin , as a genuine “ground-up innovation.” This framing is significant as it positions digital assets not as a fringe financial tool or a speculative bubble, but as a fundamental technological advancement driven by individuals and market forces rather than top-down governmental mandates. His remarks at Bitcoin 2025 highlighted: Decentralized Nature: Emphasizing that the technology and adoption are growing organically from users and developers. Economic Empowerment: Suggesting it provides new avenues for financial participation outside traditional systems. Technological Progress: Recognizing the underlying blockchain technology as a significant leap forward. This perspective aligns with a view that sees crypto as an unstoppable force, one that policy should seek to understand and integrate rather than stifle. Vance’s embrace of this narrative signals a potential shift in how a future administration might approach the digital asset space, moving away from skepticism towards recognition of its innovative potential. Can We Really Expect 100 Million Bitcoin Holders Soon? Perhaps one of the most striking predictions from JD Vance was his forecast that 100 million people would soon own Bitcoin . While he didn’t provide a specific timeline or the data underpinning this prediction, it reflects a strong belief in the accelerating pace of global Bitcoin adoption. To put this number into perspective: Metric Current Estimate (Approx.) Vance’s Prediction Global Crypto Owners ~500-600 million N/A (Prediction specific to BTC) Global Bitcoin Holders ~200-300 million An additional 100 million soon % of World Population ~2.5% – 3.8% Potentially pushing towards 5% Reaching 100 million new holders would represent a substantial increase, suggesting Vance foresees a significant acceleration in mainstream adoption. This could be driven by various factors, including increased institutional interest, clearer regulatory frameworks (which he advocated for), growing awareness, and potentially macroeconomic conditions pushing people towards alternative assets like Bitcoin . Is Crypto the Ultimate Hedge Against Inflation and Government Overreach? A core tenet of Vance’s argument for Bitcoin and crypto is their perceived role as a hedge. He explicitly mentioned hedging against both inflation and government overreach. This is a common theme among crypto proponents: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often contrasted with fiat currencies, which can be subject to inflationary pressures through quantitative easing and government spending. The narrative is that as traditional currencies potentially lose purchasing power, scarce assets like Bitcoin can retain or increase value. Government Overreach: The decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin , means they operate outside the direct control of any single government or central authority. This offers a potential hedge against excessive financial surveillance, censorship, or control over personal assets. Vance’s articulation of these points resonates deeply within the crypto community, highlighting the philosophical underpinnings that attract many to the space beyond just investment potential. It frames crypto not just as an asset class, but as a tool for financial sovereignty and protection. Why the Criticism of Regulators Like Gary Gensler? The current regulatory landscape in the United States has been a major point of contention for the crypto industry. JD Vance echoed these frustrations by criticizing regulators, specifically mentioning Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The criticism typically centers on: Regulation by Enforcement: The SEC has been accused of using enforcement actions against crypto companies rather than providing clear rules of the road beforehand. Lack of Clarity: The industry has long called for clear guidelines on how digital assets should be classified and regulated, which many argue has not been adequately provided. Jurisdictional Disputes: Uncertainty exists regarding which regulatory body (SEC, CFTC, etc.) has primary oversight over different aspects of the crypto market. Vance’s critique suggests that the current regulatory approach is hindering innovation and creating uncertainty, rather than fostering responsible growth. His comments imply a desire for a more predictable and perhaps less aggressive regulatory environment for the crypto sector. What Does Pledging Trump Administration Support Mean for US Crypto Regulation? A significant part of JD Vance’s speech focused on the potential policy direction under a future Trump administration. He pledged support for the industry, indicating a potential pivot from the current administration’s approach. This pledge included a commitment to ending policies perceived as hostile to crypto, most notably Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . Understanding the potential impact requires looking at what “support” might entail: Clearer Legislation: Pushing for congressional action to create a defined legal framework for digital assets. Industry Dialogue: Engaging with crypto businesses and experts to understand their needs and concerns. Appointments: Appointing regulators who may be more favorable or knowledgeable about the crypto space. Ending Restrictive Policies: Actively dismantling initiatives seen as targeting the crypto industry indirectly. This kind of high-level political backing, if materialized, could significantly de-risk the U.S. market for crypto businesses and investors, potentially attracting more capital and talent to the country. Dismantling Operation Chokepoint 2.0: A Key Policy Promise One specific policy target mentioned by JD Vance was the promise to end Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . This term, coined by the crypto community, refers to a perceived coordinated effort by regulators and financial institutions to limit or cut off banking services to legitimate crypto businesses. While not an official government program name, the effects described are real: Crypto companies facing difficulty opening or maintaining bank accounts. Increased scrutiny and pressure on banks that service crypto clients. Delays or denials of payments related to crypto transactions. The original ‘Operation Chokepoint’ from the Obama administration targeted businesses deemed high-risk (like payday lenders) by pressuring banks to cease doing business with them. ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ is seen as a similar tactic applied to the crypto sector. Ending such practices would be a major win for crypto businesses, providing them with essential access to the traditional financial system and fostering a more stable operating environment. What Are the Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community? JD Vance’s statements offer several key takeaways: Political Engagement Matters: The fact that high-profile politicians are speaking at crypto conferences and discussing specific policy changes underscores the growing political relevance of the industry. Policy Shift Potential: A potential change in administration could bring a significant shift in US crypto regulation , potentially favoring growth and clarity over enforcement. Continued Advocacy Needed: While promises are made, the industry must continue to advocate for clear, supportive, and innovation-friendly regulations. Adoption Narrative Strengthened: Predictions like 100 million Bitcoin holders reinforce the long-term growth narrative for the asset. For investors and businesses, these signals suggest paying close attention to the political landscape and advocating for policies that support responsible innovation rather than hinder it. Conclusion: A Glimpse into a Potentially Brighter Regulatory Future? JD Vance’s appearance at Bitcoin 2025 delivered a clear message: the potential future leadership views crypto not as a threat to be contained, but as an innovation to be fostered. His prediction of 100 million Bitcoin holders reflects a bullish long-term view, while his pointed criticism of current regulators and specific policy promises, like ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0 , signal a desire for a dramatic shift in US crypto regulation . While political promises are subject to the complexities of governance, Vance’s statements provide a glimpse of a potentially more supportive and predictable environment for the digital asset industry in the United States, offering hope to many within the community.

Taking the stage in front of a packed room of Bitcoin enthusiasts, developers, and investors, Vance delivered a powerful message, hinting that the United States government is ready to embrace Bitcoin’s role in shaping the country’s economic and technological future. “We want to start to put in motion the strategic importance of Bitcoin for the United States government,” Vance declared, drawing loud applause from the audience. “We know the People’s Republic of China doesn’t like Bitcoin — and that should make us ask: why? If our biggest adversary is trying to push away from it, maybe that’s a sign we should move towards it.” Bitcoin & National Security: A New Era Vance said that this isn’t just a one-way conversation between government officials and the public. He called for ongoing dialogue between policymakers and the crypto community to help shape smart, forward-thinking Bitcoin policies that will safeguard America’s future prosperity. “None of us want to wake up ten years from now in a country that’s less wealthy and prosperous because we made bad decisions today,” Vance cautioned. “We’re going to make the right decisions — but that depends on you guys being part of the conversation.” Bitcoin, AI, and the Political Divide In a candid moment, Vance also touched on an interesting trend he’s observed in tech circles — how different technologies seem to attract different political leanings. “Very smart right-wing people in tech seem to be drawn to Bitcoin and crypto, while very smart left-leaning folks gravitate toward artificial intelligence,” he remarked. While acknowledging this was a generalization, he stressed the importance of keeping Bitcoin and AI conversations connected. “What happens in AI will very much affect Bitcoin — and what happens to Bitcoin will affect AI. We need to ensure that Bitcoin is part of the AI conversation,” he added. Why It Matters Vance’s speech marks a turning point in how US leadership views Bitcoin — not just as an investment, but as a tool of strategic value in global geopolitics and economic security.

Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg","As Bitcoin and Ethereum hover near critical resistance levels, market sentiment is shifting rapidly. Analysts are now calling for an incoming Altseason, with bullish momentum building across the board, even as macroeconomic uncertainty continues to rattle global markets. Despite rising treasury yields and geopolitical tensions, crypto assets are showing strength, and altcoins appear poised to benefit next. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally Top analyst Axel Bitblaze has spotlighted May 30th as a potentially defining moment in this cycle. This week, over $5 billion in stablecoins will be distributed to FTX creditors—a massive injection of liquidity representing nearly 2% of the entire stablecoin supply. Unlike previous events, this capital is expected to stay within the crypto ecosystem. Most of these investors remained in crypto despite the FTX collapse. Now, as they regain access to their funds, many are likely to rotate that capital back into the market. With Bitcoin targeting $120K and Ethereum challenging the $3,000 level, the stage is set for capital to flow into high-beta altcoins and push for an Altseason. Altcoins Setup Strengthens Ahead Of $5B FTX Liquidity Injection The FTX collapse in late 2022 was a brutal event, marking the climax of the previous bear market. It triggered mass panic, billions in liquidations, and the final capitulation that ultimately set the bottom of the cycle. While devastating in the short term, it paved the way for recovery. Now, nearly two years later, May 30th may become the most important day of this new phase. FTX is distributing over $5 billion in stablecoins to creditors this week—a long-awaited step in the bankruptcy process. These payouts represent nearly 2% of the total stablecoin supply and will hit the market in one large wave. But this isn’t just idle money returning to passive holders. Most of these users remained in crypto through the storm. They didn’t leave—they adapted, held, and now, they’re getting liquidity back in the middle of a bullish setup. The timing couldn’t be better. Ethereum is pumping, flirting with a critical resistance level that, if broken, could confirm a major move for altcoins. Bitcoin is hovering near its all-time highs, altcoins are gaining serious traction, pro-crypto narratives are heating up in Washington, and regulatory progress is finally in motion. Everything is aligning at once. Bitblaze explains that this $5B return of capital could be the exact catalyst the market needs. In his view, this sudden injection of liquidity could send Bitcoin toward $120K—and unlock the altseason traders have been waiting for. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? Ethereum Eyes $2,700 Breakout As Altseason Momentum Builds Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,638, consolidating just below a key resistance zone at $2,700. After a sharp rally in early May, ETH has held its gains and formed a solid base above the 34 EMA ($2,331) and key moving averages. The 200-day SMA, sitting at $2,697, now acts as a critical ceiling for price action. A clean breakout above this level would mark the first major reclaim of the long-term trend line since the bull cycle resumed, potentially unlocking a powerful continuation for ETH and the broader altcoin market. Volume has remained steady throughout this consolidation phase, indicating buyer interest and positioning ahead of a decisive move. ETH’s structure shows higher lows and strong bullish follow-through, suggesting that momentum is building just beneath the surface. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? If Ethereum can close above $2,700 with conviction, it would not only confirm a breakout but could also trigger broader market rotation into altcoins.

With Bitcoin hovering near ATHs and macro conditions favoring digital assets, ETH’s next move could be the spark that ignites a new wave of altcoin rallies across the board.

Bitcoin was stuck above $107,200, while the market capitalization of all coins rose by 0.45% to $3.4 trillion. This article provides the Toncoin, Mask Network, and Pepe price predictions. Pepe price prediction Pepe chart by TradingView Meme coins had a mixed performance on Thursday morning. Pepe, the third-biggest meme coin rose from $0.000005253 in March to $0.00001490 today. It crossed the important resistance point at $0.000009257 on March 26. This was a notable level since it was the neckline of the double-bottom point at $0.0000057. Pepe Coin price has formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) crossed each other. A golden cross is one of the most bullish chart patterns in technical analysis. Pepe has also formed a bullish flag chart pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a rectangle pattern. In this case, the flag section seems like it has been blown upside. Pepe Coin price has jumped above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00001410. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the Pepe price is bullish, with the main target being the all-time high point at $0.00002825. A drop below the support at $0.00001263 will invalidate the bullish forecast.

Mask Network price has done well in the past few weeks as demand for these tokens rise. For starters, Mask Network is a crypto project that helps people preserve their privacy when using social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. The Mask Network price bottomed at $0.93 in April to $2.76 this week, a 200% surge. It has surged above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has jumped above the overbought level. While the token has more upside, there is a likelihood that the rally will take a breather in the coming weeks. If this happens, it may drop and retest the support at $1.50 and then bounce back. Toncoin price forecast TON price chart | Source: TradingView TON price has been in a strong downtrend in the past few months, moving from a high of $8.27 in June last year to $3.36 today. This decline happened as its ecosystem came under intense pressure, with top coins like Hamster Kombat, Notcoin, and Catizen plunging to record lows. Toncoin is showing signs of stabilizing after BlackRock said that it would join in a $1.5 billion bond sale by Telegram, a social media platform with over 900 million active users. It also jumped after reports emerged that it was about to partner with xAI, Elon Musk’s AI company. The daily chart shows that the TON price bottomed at $2.3675 in April and then bounced back to $3.37 today. Still, it remains below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is providing it with substantial resistance. Toncoin price has also formed a bearish flag pattern. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the TON price makes a bearish breakdown, potentially to the support at $2.36 in the near term. A move above the 50-day moving average at $3.7212 will invalidate the bearish outlook.

2025-05-29T00:00:58.000Z,"‘End of Bear Market’ – Analyst Says Altcoins About To Shine, Updates Forecast on Bitcoin and Ethereum","A crypto strategist thinks that altcoins are about to upstage Bitcoin ( BTC ) after years of languishing in the background. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 789,100 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the period of altcoin underperformance against Bitcoin is almost over based on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart. The BTC.D chart tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. A bearish BTC.D indicates that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. According to Van de Poppe, altcoins are now poised to outpace Bitcoin as the BTC.D chart is flashing a bearish reversal signal on the weekly chart. “The end of the bear market (yes, a bear market on altcoins underperforming Bitcoin) is still here. Strong bearish divergence on the Bitcoin dominance, implying we’re about to reverse and altcoins about to shine. Nothing has changed.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 63.89%. Looking at Bitcoin, the trader thinks BTC will retest a key psychological area as support before rallying to fresh record-high levels. “I’m monitoring the current price action and I won’t be surprised if we’re seeing a slight correction happening on Bitcoin. Probably macro-driven or whatever reason, but I wouldn’t be surprised to build some more stamina before we continue the rally to $120,000-$130,000.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $109,112. As for Ethereum ( ETH ), the analyst says a correction toward the $2,000 price level would present a solid opportunity for long-term investors. “Similarly, I think it’s vital that, if ETH drops beneath $2,400, that will give a tremendous opportunity.

Schiff argues Bitcoin’s value stems from user belief, not fundamental attributes, unlike gold. Despite BTC’s growth (now $108,899), Schiff believes it has no sustainable future as money. Well-known American stockbroker Peter Schiff is not backing down from his stance: Bitcoin (BTC), he insists, is not money. A long-time Bitcoin critic, Schiff has consistently argued that the cryptocurrency lacks the fundamental qualities needed to function as actual money. In a recent podcast , the renowned financial analyst maintained his opinion about Bitcoin. According to Schiff, Bitcoin has other qualities and is suitable for purposes other than money. Schiff on Bitcoin: A “Collectible Token” Valued by Belief, Not Intrinsic Attribute Per Schiff’s definition, Bitcoin is a collectible token with no unique value. The analyst thinks that Bitcoin users can deploy the crypto token for trading involving buying, selling, and storing Bitcoin.

The announcement was made at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference on Wednesday at the Venetian Convention Center in Las Vegas by Bilal Bin Saqib, the special assistant to the Pakistani prime minister on blockchain and cryptocurrency. Saqib announced that Pakistan will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and never sell its BTC trove in future. Furthermore, Pakistan wants to follow in the footsteps of the United States, which intends to implement a strategic Bitcoin reserve to deal with the high debt burden. “We are getting inspired by the U.S. government. We will be holding these Bitcoins and we will never, ever sell them,” Saqib stated . What Next For Bitcoin Price Action? Bitcoin price experienced a significant resistance level above $110k in the past few days, thus resulting in the ongoing market correction. The flagship coin dropped over 2 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $107k on Wednesday, May 29, during the late North American trading session. Bitcoin price has experienced relentless bearish pressure since last Friday, despite the notable accumulation by institutional investors. Furthermore, more institutional investors, led by GameStop, have joined Strategy in acquiring more BTCs as a hedge against inflation. https://x.com/techcharts/status/1927791497090363555?s=46 According to market analyst, Aksel Kibar, Bitcoin price must clear the resistance hurdle around $109k, in the weekly timeframe, to invalidate a potential retrace towards $76k.

2025-05-28T23:00:44.000Z,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Boost: K33 Secures $6.22M in Strategic Funding","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Boost: K33 Secures $6.22M in Strategic Funding In a significant move signaling growing confidence in digital assets, Swedish crypto broker K33 recently announced a substantial capital raise aimed squarely at strengthening its balance sheet with Bitcoin. This development highlights a broader trend of companies exploring how digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, can serve strategic financial purposes beyond just trading. What is a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Why Does it Matter? A Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin as part of its corporate reserves, similar to how traditional companies hold cash, bonds, or gold. It’s a decision driven by various factors, often including: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about currency devaluation, some companies see Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a potential hedge against inflation. Store of Value: Positioning Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, potentially appreciating over time. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional holdings. Signal of Innovation: Demonstrating forward-thinking adoption of emerging technologies. For a company like K33, a crypto broker, adopting such a strategy aligns with its core business and can instill confidence in its customers and investors regarding its belief in the asset class it facilitates trading for. K33 ‘s Strategic Crypto Funding Explained K33, a prominent name in the Nordic crypto market, announced on its official website that it has successfully raised 60 million SEK, equivalent to approximately $6.22 million USD. This funding wasn’t from a typical venture capital round but through investment agreements with its key, long-term shareholders. The stated purpose of this capital injection is explicit: to fund the company’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. This means the raised funds are earmarked specifically for acquiring Bitcoin to be held on K33’s balance sheet. This move is strategic for several reasons: It strengthens K33’s financial position by adding a potentially appreciating asset. It demonstrates a strong conviction from its core investors in both K33’s business model and the long-term value of Bitcoin. It positions K33 as a proactive player in the crypto broker space, potentially attracting clients interested in companies with direct exposure to Bitcoin. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Investment While K33’s move is significant for a crypto broker, the concept of companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury is not entirely new. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, is perhaps the most well-known example, holding billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Other public and private companies have also allocated portions of their reserves to the digital asset. Here are a few notable examples (values are approximate and subject to change): Company Approx. BTC Holdings Estimated Current USD Value Primary Motivation (often cited) MicroStrategy ~214,400 BTC ~$13.5 Billion+ Inflation hedge, Capital allocation strategy Marathon Digital Holdings ~17,631 BTC ~$1.1 Billion+ Treasury reserve, Assets from mining Coinbase ~10,500 BTC ~$660 Million+ Corporate treasury Tesla ~9,720 BTC ~$610 Million+ Corporate treasury diversification Note: These figures are estimates based on publicly available data and market prices at a given time. K33 joining this list, especially as a dedicated crypto broker, adds another layer to the narrative of institutional and corporate adoption. It suggests that even companies deeply embedded within the crypto ecosystem see strategic value in holding the underlying asset itself, not just facilitating its trade. Implications for the Crypto Broker Landscape and Beyond K33’s decision could have ripple effects. As a regulated crypto broker operating in Europe, its move might inspire other similar firms to consider their own treasury strategies. If more crypto-native companies allocate capital to Bitcoin, it could further legitimize the asset class and potentially drive additional demand. For investors, this news from K33 provides insight into how companies operating directly in the crypto space are managing their balance sheets and expressing their long-term outlook on Bitcoin. It reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate component of corporate finance. Key Takeaways from K33’s Funding Round K33 secured $6.22 million specifically for a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The funding came from key existing shareholders, indicating strong internal support. This move reflects growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset. It positions K33 uniquely within the crypto broker market by directly holding BTC on its balance sheet with dedicated funding. The trend of corporate Bitcoin investment continues to gain traction. K33’s successful funding round for its Bitcoin treasury strategy is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic statement. It underscores the increasing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and highlights how companies, particularly those in the digital asset space, are integrating cryptocurrencies into their long-term financial planning. As the crypto market matures, expect to see more innovative approaches like this shaping the future of corporate finance.

2025-05-28T23:00:04.000Z,"Bitcoin Expert Samson Mow Reveals Why BTC Is Not Trading At $10 Million Per Coin Already","Samson Mow, a Bitcoin expert and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of JAN3, a BTC-focused infrastructure firm, has shared a striking take on the current valuation of the flagship cryptocurrency. According to Mow, Bitcoin is still far from its full potential and, in his view, should already be priced at $10 million per coin. Why Bitcoin Is Not Worth $10 Million Yet In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Mow stated, “If the world understood Bitcoin, we would be at $10 million a coin now.” This comment reflects his belief that Bitcoin’s true value is heavily undervalued and underestimated. Related Reading: Massive $200 Million Sell Wall Holds Bitcoin At $111,000 And $113,000 – Here’s What We Know For Mow, BTC is more than just a coin to trade; it is a revolutionary asset that could shake up the foundations of the current financial system. With its capped supply, decentralized nature, and consistently growing value, many even believe that BTC has the potential to act as a global reserve currency. Yet despite growing adoption and visibility, Mow argues that most people in the world, including institutions, policymakers, and retailers, still do not fully comprehend Bitcoin and its implications. According to the JAN3 CEO, this knowledge gap is what is holding Bitcoin back from achieving the massive price surge that he and many other long-term advocates anticipate. While the $10 million mark remains speculative for now, Mow’s remarks reflect a wider sentiment among Bitcoin enthusiasts who see the current price as just the beginning. For example, top Bitcoin supporters and investors like Michael J. Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, have shared similar views, predicting an explosive rise in Bitcoin’s value to $10 million by 2035. Likewise, Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO), has voiced strong confidence in Bitcoin reaching the $1 million mark. He believes this milestone could realistically be achieved within the next five years. Demand For BTC Surges Among Institutions And The Wealthy With the growing belief that the Bitcoin price will only continue to rise in the long term, social media reports indicate a significant surge in interest and demand among financial institutions and the wealthy. Notably, Saylor, one of the biggest advocates for Bitcoin, has long been accumulating the cryptocurrency in hundreds of thousands. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Rally Over After $111,900 ATH? Global M2 Money Supply Is Still Going Donald Trump, the United States (US) President, has also been a public supporter of Bitcoin, with reports revealing that he is actively buying the flagship cryptocurrency. Even investing legend and hedge fund manager Hugh Henry disclosed earlier this month that he intends to sell his $35 million house to buy $10 million worth of Bitcoin. Binance CEO Richard Teng also announced that the wealthy are showing significant interest in the leading cryptocurrency. He revealed that sovereign funds and high-net-worth individuals are now purchasing BTC like never before. This growing accumulation by institutions and the rich signals strong confidence in BTC’s long-term value and sustainability.

K33 could purchase up to 57 Bitcoin (BTC) at BTC’s current price of just over $108,000. Source: K33K33 CEO Bull Jenssen posted to X on May 28 that he thinks Bitcoin will be the “best-performing asset in the coming decade,” and his company will “accumulate as many as possible while unlocking powerful operational synergies with our brokerage operation.”“Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build you own? Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028. The remaining 15 million Swedish krona ($1.5 million) will come through a new share issuance and warrants, according to K33. If investors convert their warrants before March 2026, they are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate. If fully exercised, K33 could raise up to 75 million Swedish krona ($7.7 million) for its Bitcoin buy. Bitcoin treasury part of expansion plans In K33’s interim report for the first quarter, released May 28, Jenssen said K33 is working with other Bitcoin treasury companies in the Nordics and hopes to use its treasury as a foundation to offer new services, such as BTC-backed lending. “For K33, Bitcoin is not only a high-conviction asset — it’s also a strategic enabler. With a sizable BTC reserve, we will be able to strengthen our financial position while unlocking new revenue streams, product capabilities, and partnerships,” he said. Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110KK33’s share price traded flat with the news of its Bitcoin treasury pivot and closed May 28 trading down 1.96%, according to Google Finance.K33’s stock price wasn’t affected by the announcement of the firm’s Bitcoin strategy.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share.

Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $2,300 and $2,500: $420 million in calls (buy) vs. $220 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $200 million.Between $2,500 and $2,600: $500 million calls vs. $130 million puts, favoring calls by $370 million.Between $2,600 and $2,700: $590 million calls vs. $35 million puts, favoring calls by $555 million.Between $2,700 and $2,900: $780 million calls vs. $10 million puts, favoring calls by $770 million.Bulls are strongly incentivized to push ETH past $2,700, yet the broader context may override those efforts. Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”“We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats,” said US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoption","The Katana Foundation, a nonprofit focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) development, is launching its private mainnet, aiming to unlock greater crypto asset productivity via deeper liquidity and higher yields for users.The Katana Foundation launched a DeFi-optimized, private blockchain, Katana, on May 28, incubated by GSR Markets and Polygon Labs, with the public mainnet launch set for June.The new blockchain will enable users to earn higher yields and explore DeFi in a “unique, optimized yield environment” that unlocks latent value through an ecosystem that makes every digital asset “work harder,” according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph.“DeFi users deserve ecosystems that prioritize sustainable liquidity and consistent ‘real’ yields,” wrote Marc Boiron, the CEO of Polygon Labs and core contributor at Katana, adding: “Katana’s user-centric model turns inefficiencies into advantages, establishing a truly positive-sum environment for builders and participants alike.\""Source: KatanaKatana aims to solve the crypto industry’s liquidity fragmentation issue, which can cause significant price slippage, as one of the main barriers limiting institutional DeFi participationRelated: Here’s how abstraction minimizes fragmentation in DeFi, making it more fluidTo reduce the value slippage in DeFi, Katana’s blockchain concentrates the liquidity from numerous protocols and collects yields on all potential sources to create an ecosystem with deeper liquidity and more predictable lending and borrowing rates.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey. Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved. And when in doubt, always verify before sending funds.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/elderly-crypto-investors-are-getting-scammed-teach-them-these-key-safety-tips?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

He added that he is confident many of those investors will cycle back into the crypto market to fuel the next big rally.2. Smart money agrees on Bitcoin’s year-end targetSeveral analysts have set $200,000 as their target for Bitcoin in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices.Kendrick said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins.Related: A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route“The US Senate… voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act,” Kendrick wrote in the email note. “The point of the stablecoin Act is that stablecoins will further legitimise the whole asset class.

David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets.

It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers.

In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party.Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.”“So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past.

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

2025-05-27T21:52:14.000Z,"Growing BTC reserve requires Congressional legislation — VanEck exec","Building a permanent US strategic Bitcoin reserve would likely require targeted legislation rather than executive action, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets, Matthew Sigel. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order. According to the order, the US government can only acquire Bitcoin through budget-neutral strategies or asset forfeiture, prompting a range of different ideas on how to add to the government’s stockpile of nearly 200,000 BTC.From left to right, Alex Thorn, Matthew Sigel, Matthew Pines and Fred Thiel.

This strategy would also be budget-neutral, Hines said.The price of gold reached an all-time high of $3,500 per ounce in April but experienced a minor pullback to around $3,300 on May 27.Magazine: TradFi fans ignored Lyn Alden’s BTC tip — Now she says it’ll hit 7 figures: X Hall of Flame",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-reserve-requires-congressional-legislation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The acquisitions would be financed using existing funds within the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department. As Cointelegraph reported, the Trump administration has reiterated the need to use “budget-neutral ways” to acquire Bitcoin without burdening taxpayers.Source: CryptoGoosAt the Bitcoin Conference, Lummis said the Trump administration has a team working on “digital asset issues,” including legislation on stablecoins, market structure and the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve.“They will probably roll out in that order,” she said.“The Senate Banking Committee has passed the stablecoin bill out of committee,” said Lummis, adding: “We’re getting close to being ready to have it on the floor.
