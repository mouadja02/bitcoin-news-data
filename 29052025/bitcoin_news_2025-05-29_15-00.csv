2025-05-29T13:00:00.000Z,"Trump Media & Technology Group: Bitcoin Is A Bad Idea","Summary Trump Media's Bitcoin treasury strategy won't solve its core issues of weak user engagement, deteriorating financials, and extreme overvaluation. The $2.5 billion capital raise exposes shareholders to high dilution and leverage, making DJT a risky, leveraged bet on Bitcoin's volatility. Valuation remains unsustainably high, with price-to-sales and price-to-book ratios far above industry norms, driven by a 'Trump premium' rather than fundamentals. Despite a possible bull case tied to Bitcoin's price, I see significant downside and maintain a strong sell rating on Trump Media shares. Co-Authored by Noah Cox and Brock Heilig Investment Thesis Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), President Donald Trump’s media and technology company, are down over 30% over the last six months and have fallen by more than 35% year-to-date. While the company is implementing a Bitcoin treasury strategy (that has worked well for lifting share prices of some firms), I don’t think this will work for the owner of Truth Social. Despite some major crypto moves that have garnered a ton of attention this week (thanks to the Bitcoin Conference), the company’s core performance remains poor. Weak social media traffic and deteriorating financials continue to haunt the company and prevent it from growing. Additionally, the lofty valuation is completely out of line with fundamentals, given DJT’s weak user engagement, high costs, and poor financial results. Even with Bitcoin on its balance sheet, this doesn’t change. The newly announced plan to put ~$2.5 billion into a Bitcoin reserve doesn’t solve DJT’s underlying problems. The plan could make the company some money, but there are far too many foundational issues that outweigh a potential Bitcoin treasury. At the end of the day, the company becomes a leveraged bet in Bitcoin. This could work, but I am concerned they will not be able to attract the same financing terms that fellow Bitcoin treasury company MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has attracted. Notably, since the Bitcoin treasury plan was confirmed, DJT’s stock has fallen over 10%. I think the market is seeing what I am fearing: this won’t work. Shares here are a strong sell. Why I'm Doing Follow-Up Coverage One of the main reasons why I’m doing follow-up coverage on Trump Media Group is because of their new plan to focus on a Bitcoin treasury. To be clear, I think some Bitcoin treasury solutions can work. We’ve seen this plan work with Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy (rebranded as Strategy), who holds more than 550,000 Bitcoin. Unfortunately, I don’t think the Trump Media Group inspires the same confidence. Back in January, the Trump family launched $TRUMP and $MELANIA crypto coins, named after the President and his wife. These quickly dropped in value. I think this has left a bad taste in investors’ mouths when it comes to the Trump family and crypto. To me, it seems like the company is trying to copy the crypto reserve playbook. I don’t think it's going to work. That is why I am doing follow-up coverage on the company. I am concerned about major dilution/financial strain on shareholders. This follow up analysis is meant to compare Trump Media Group’s strategy to those of successful crypto asset adopters. Bitcoin Reserve Here Is A Bad Idea One of the biggest indicators to me that this plan will fail for the company is because of high leverage and dilution. The company is raising roughly $2.5 billion, consisting of ~ $1.5 billion in new common equity and $1.0 billion in convertible senior notes. Relative to the size of the Trump Media Group, this is an enormous number, and it comes at the expense of shareholders. If Bitcoin’s price doesn’t climb substantially (or worse, it falls), the company could be stuck with a massive amount of debt to repay. Keep in mind for other Bitcoin treasury companies (like Strategy and GameStop ( GME )), the companies committed cash already on the balance sheet before financing more capital for more Bitcoin purchases. With this Bitcoin strategy, the owner of Truth social is now highly susceptible to extreme volatility. Putting a large chunk of corporate treasury into Bitcoin puts the company in a tough spot that exposes them to wild market swings. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, and critics have long noted that holding a big, volatile asset can risk severe financial losses. This is especially a concern for Trump Media and Technology Group because the company doesn’t have other stable cash-generating businesses. To compare, MicroStrategy has done a fairly strong job of segmenting risk by offering a host of convertible notes, preferred stock, and common shares to help investors buy the security they believe matches their risk preference. While I am not a fan of some of this capital structure, they have done a good job of segmenting risk here. Trump Media and Technology Group has not done this (at least yet). While the company claims that this Bitcoin play will create synergies for subscription payments and use cases within their Truth Social and Truth+ media and social media brands, I just don’t see the use case here. Bitcoin’s use case is not for payments (mainly). This is what stablecoins are for. In essence, they are trying to use an asset called “digital gold” to replace dollar payments vs. stablecoins (industry standard). This feels backwards and not a disciplined approach to crypto. Valuation The Trump Media and Technology Group’s valuation metrics still remain extreme by most standards. The company’s Trailing Twelve Months price-to-sales ratio is currently ~1,269 . When compared to the sector median of just 1.22, this is a steep 103,000% premium to the sector median. Personally, I think this is an incredible disconnect between price and actual revenue. While a Bitcoin treasury can be a strong move, in this case, I think this is a strong indicator that the stock’s current price level is unsustainable. Investors buying shares in this stock are paying over 1,000 times the company’s sales. This type of premium only makes sense if the company has both explosive growth and near-flawless execution, neither of which have materialized (I believe). Currently, their price-to-book ratio is also high. The TTM price-to-book ratio of 5.70 is 190.5% higher than the sector median of 1.96. In practical terms, nearly all of the stock’s market value is built on intangible goodwill, rather than on hard assets or earnings power. If Trump Media shares were to re-rate down to the typical industry price-to-book multiple, the stock would need to drop about 65% from current levels. In my opinion, the valuation premium appears to be almost purely a “Trump premium,” with investors betting on the celebrity and political relevance of the company’s figurehead, rather than any demonstrated business performance. Even with the Bitcoin treasury on deck, I still think these metrics will not improve a lot. On the operating side, costs are growing faster than revenues. For the full year 2024, cost of revenue increased 275% . This means that the company is spending significantly more to generate each dollar of sales, which is a concerning trend. With this, I think shares should trade at the sector median price to book ratio going forward. This would imply 65% downside from here. Bull Thesis Although I’m bearish on the owner of Truth Social, I want to highlight what, I think, is a small potential for a bull thesis here. After the company adopted their Bitcoin treasury strategy, I think this has ironically become their strongest bullish argument. Bulls argue that by raising $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin, Trump Media has positioned itself as a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin’s price. This means that if you’re very bullish on Bitcoin, owning stock in Trump’s media company could amplify that. If Bitcoin continues to appreciate, the company’s asset base and, theoretically, its stock price, could do really well. On this same front, another point bulls will point out is that this massive capital raise gives the company a war chest that could be used to fund new ventures, acquisitions, or technology development (the primary use of the offering is to purchase Bitcoin). They don’t have to spend it all on Bitcoin. These are all plausible. The reason I am bearish, however, is because I think these are unlikely. At the end of the day, though, there are tough realities that the company has to face. The $1 billion convertible note is essentially a huge bet that must be paid back (or converted) later. This means that if Bitcoin’s price doesn’t rise high enough, the company could end up with a depleted treasury and a large debt to service, putting shareholder equity in a precarious spot. If Bitcoin stumbles, there is absolutely no diversified revenue stream to fall back on, and this worries me greatly. This compares to MicroStrategy, which has a record of successfully refinancing debt. Takeaway While I am overall bullish on the concept of a Bitcoin treasury strategy, Trump Media and Technology Group’s new Bitcoin reserve strategy only strengthens my original bearish stance. The company’s core problems, like overvaluation, declining user engagement, and financial underperformance, remain unaddressed. If anything, I think that management’s decision to take a gamble on Bitcoin highlights a lack of viable solutions for the company. I see significant downside from here. For the company’s share price to make sense, either its social media business would need a strong turnaround, or Bitcoin would need to move much higher. Because of this, I am still a strong sell on shares of the Trump Media and Technology Group.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790718-trump-media-and-technology-group-bitcoin-is-a-bad-idea?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","MSTR|GME|STRF|STRK|DJT",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T12:49:52.000Z,"Best Betting Sites for Esports – Esports Betting in Canada","Esports betting keeps blowing up in Canada, and it’s not slowing down in 2025. Whether you're betting on CS:GO, Valorant, LoL, or Dota 2, you need platforms that pay fast, accept crypto, and don’t waste your time with endless forms. We’ve tested the best betting sites for esports that welcome Canadian players and support smooth crypto wagering from the first deposit to the final payout. If you're looking for trusted, no-fuss platforms for esports betting in Canada, this list breaks down the best options that actually deliver. Why Esports Betting Is Huge in Canada Right Now Esports used to be a niche thing — now it's a full-blown betting scene with millions of fans and real money on the line. In Canada, esports betting has grown fast, and 2025 is shaping up to be the biggest year yet. From big titles like Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, and League of Legends, to tournaments streamed live 24/7, Canadian players have more reasons than ever to get in on the action. The Shift to Real Esports Markets It’s no longer just “who wins the match.” You can bet on first kills, map wins, total rounds, clutch plays — all of it. Esports betting platforms now offer just as many props and live bets as traditional sports. The odds are sharper, the lines are tighter, and the action never really stops. That kind of variety is exactly why the best betting sites for esports are pulling in more crypto bettors every year — especially in Canada, where traditional sportsbooks often lag behind or limit esports coverage. Crypto Makes It Easier for Canadian Players Getting your funds in and out of Canadian sportsbooks can be a headache. Banks block payments, credit cards get rejected, and withdrawal times drag. With crypto? None of that. Top platforms for esports betting in Canada let you deposit Bitcoin, ETH, USDT, or other crypto, and bet in seconds — no middlemen, no red tape. The best betting sites for esports all support fast, low-fee crypto payments, and that’s made a big difference for Canadian players who just want to bet, watch, and cash out. Betting Where the Action Is Canadian players are betting on international tournaments more than ever — LEC, LCS, The International, BLAST Premier, and more. And because matches happen around the clock, esports betting gives players way more flexibility than traditional sports ever could. The sites we’re about to cover offer full match coverage, live streaming, crypto bonuses, and — most importantly — no KYC delays. How We Picked the Best Esports Betting Sites There’s no shortage of sites claiming to offer esports betting. But when you actually log in, most of them fall short — outdated design, weak odds, or just a tiny selection of matches. To build this list, we looked for the best betting sites for esports that actually work for Canadian players, especially those betting with crypto. Here’s what mattered when picking the winners. Full Esports Coverage — Not Just the Big Names We looked for sites that go beyond just League of Legends and CS:GO. The top sites on this list offer betting markets for: Valorant Dota 2 Rainbow Six Overwatch StarCraft II Call of Duty And tons of smaller leagues and regional tournaments Live bets, map-specific odds, and prop bets were a must. Crypto-Friendly Banking Every platform on this list supports crypto — and not just Bitcoin. We prioritized sites that also take Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether (USDT), and sometimes even coins like Dogecoin or Monero. These platforms offer quick, secure transactions without the usual banking headaches in Canada. No KYC (or Optional Only) KYC is a dealbreaker for a lot of crypto bettors. We only included sites that either don’t require verification or only ask for it at very high withdrawal limits. That means Canadian players can stay private, sign up fast, and move their money freely. Solid Odds and Betting Tools We compared odds across all platforms to make sure they were competitive. Sites that offer live odds changes, detailed match stats, early markets, and clear bet slips ranked higher. Some even offer bet tracking and esports-specific promos. Clean Interface and Mobile Access Whether you’re watching from your laptop or betting from your phone, the platform needs to run smoothly. Every site here loads fast, works on mobile, and makes it easy to find esports markets without digging through menus built for traditional sports. Best Betting Sites for Esports – Top Picks for 2025 Some sites just slap together a few esports lines and call it a day. Others actually treat esports like the full betting market it is — live odds, real-time updates, and enough match options to keep up with tournaments around the world. If you're in Canada and betting with crypto, you want speed, flexibility, and coverage — not just a few CS:GO games buried under a wall of soccer and hockey odds. These are the best betting sites for esports in 2025, and every one of them accepts crypto, works for Canadian players, and has legit esports action every day. 1.

How to Start Betting on Esports with Crypto You don’t need to be a tech wizard or a crypto expert to bet on esports with digital coins. In fact, the whole process is often quicker than using traditional payment methods — especially if you’re in Canada, where card payments or e-transfers can get blocked or delayed on betting sites. Here’s how to go from zero to placing your first crypto esports bet in a few easy steps. Step 1: Set Up a Crypto Wallet Before anything else, you’ll need a crypto wallet — this is where your Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT will live. Simple wallet options: Trust Wallet (mobile) Exodus (desktop and mobile) MetaMask (browser extension) Once it’s set up, back up your seed phrase and keep it somewhere safe. That phrase is the only way to recover your funds if you lose access. Step 2: Buy Some Crypto You can buy crypto on any major exchange like: Coinbase Binance Kraken After buying your preferred coin (BTC, ETH, LTC, or USDT are all widely accepted), send it to your wallet address. Most transfers are completed within minutes. Step 3: Choose a Betting Site Scroll back up and choose one of the best betting sites for esports from this list. If you want full esports coverage with fast withdrawals, Bassbet and Kryptosino are great. For something simple and quick, try Unlim or Auf. Click the link, register with your email, and head to the deposit section. Step 4: Make Your First Deposit Copy the deposit address from the site Go into your wallet and paste it as the recipient Choose the amount and confirm the transfer Your funds will show up in your betting account once the blockchain confirms the transaction — usually within 5 to 15 minutes depending on the coin. Step 5: Start Betting on Esports Now just go to the esports section, find a match you want to bet on, and pick your market. You can go with match winner, map totals, or live in-play options. Confirm your bet, and you’re in. Tips for Smarter Esports Betting Anyone can throw money at a match, but winning — or at least not draining your crypto wallet in a weekend — takes a bit of strategy. Whether you’re betting casually or trying to grow your bankroll over time, these tips will help you get more out of the best betting sites for esports in Canada. 1. Know the Game Before You Bet If you don’t understand how Valorant’s economy works or what a CS:GO map veto is, don’t bet yet. Take some time to watch matches, learn how the game flows, and understand what actually influences outcomes. Knowing the meta and team styles is just as important as reading odds. 2. Bet Live — But Only If You Can Keep Up Live betting is exciting, especially in esports where momentum shifts fast. But odds can swing wildly, and hesitation will cost you. If you’re going to bet in-play, use a platform with fast updates (like Bassbet or Bitsler), and only bet if you’re actively watching the match. 3. Use Stablecoins for Bankroll Management Instead of betting with Bitcoin or Ethereum — which can jump in value overnight — consider using USDT or other stablecoins. This keeps your bet values consistent and helps you track wins and losses more clearly. 4. Don’t Chase Comebacks Esports can be unpredictable, and big comebacks do happen — but betting into a losing streak hoping for a miracle usually backfires. Set a budget, bet within it, and don’t try to recover losses in one go. Even the best esports betting sites can’t help if your emotions run your bets. 5. Shop Odds Across Multiple Sites One site might have CS:GO at 1.75 while another offers 1.85 for the same team. It might not seem like much, but those little bumps add up fast. Use multiple platforms (like Librabet + Spinbet) to compare odds before locking in big bets. 6. Focus on a Few Titles Stick to games you follow. If you’re solid on League of Legends, bet LoL. Don’t start placing wagers on Rainbow Six just because it’s the only match left on a slow day. Specializing helps you catch value when others are betting blind. Conclusion If you're into esports and betting with crypto, there's no reason to stick with slow, clunky sportsbooks. The sites we’ve listed actually work — fast deposits, no KYC walls, and real coverage of the games people in Canada actually care about. Some platforms, like Bassbet and Kryptosino, are built for serious esports bettors. Others, like Auf and Unlim, are perfect for quick bets with no hassle. Whatever your style, you’ve got solid options here — and they all pay out in crypto. Pick one that fits what you're looking for, throw in a few bets, and see how it goes.

2025-05-29T12:47:34.000Z,"Ethereum to Break $3K? Top Altcoins Set to Follow the Second-Biggest Crypto’s Surge","Ethereum is on the move again. After spending months consolidating, $ETH has powered back above $2,7K and is flashing signs of serious strength. Analysts believe Ethereum is ‘coiling,’ like a spring building tension before a major breakout. All eyes are now on the $3K level – a major psychological and technical barrier. What’s fueling this optimism? In short, Ethereum looks increasingly favored by institutional players, and the charts are finally catching up to the fundamentals. $ETH has always been more than just Bitcoin’s little brother. It’s the engine of DeFi, the home of countless dApps, and the heart of the ERC-20 universe. When it pumps, the entire ecosystem tends to follow. That includes altcoins, DeFi tokens, and of course, the wonderfully chaotic world of meme coins . So if Ethereum is preparing for liftoff, it might be time to scan the horizon for the best altcoins to follow it into orbit. Why Ethereum’s Breakout Could Fuel an Altcoin Boom Ethereum’s chart is forming an ascending triangle – classic breakout territory. Volume is rising, sentiment is improving, and the on-chain activity shows renewed life. But what really has the crypto crowd buzzing is the shift in capital. Institutional investors are quietly favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin. Maybe it’s the $ETH staking yield, maybe it’s the diversified use cases. Whatever the reason, big money is betting on Ethereum. Right now, $ETH sits at around $2,7K, and analysts are eyeing $3K as the next major target. A clean break above that level would likely send a ripple effect through the ERC-20 ecosystem. Traders often rotate profits from majors into top altcoins once momentum picks up. That’s where things get interesting for the rest of the market. Altcoins and meme coins often ride Ethereum’s coattails during bull runs. As liquidity flows in, risk appetite grows. And with $ETH showing strength, many believe this could be the start of a fresh wave for ERC-20 tokens. Let’s look at three new crypto projects perfectly positioned to benefit. 1. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – The First AI-Powered Meme Coin With a Mind of Its Own As Ethereum builds momentum toward $3K, meme coins are already starting to twitch – and Mind of Pepe ($MIND) is leading the charge. With over $11M raised in its presale and just over one day left to buy in, $MIND is one of the most hyped ERC-20 meme coins in the space right now. Right now, you can buy $MIND for $0.0037515. And it might be your last chance to buy this tech-powered juggernaut built for the next cycle. Mind of Pepe is the first-ever meme coin with a self-evolving AI agent . This isn’t just branding – the AI has its own wallet, blockchain access, and even an account on X where it analyzes trends, shapes conversation, and identifies alpha before the rest of the market sees it. $MIND holders get exclusive access to this intel via token-gated channels, giving them a first-in edge on upcoming opportunities. The AI can also launch new tokens, give first dibs to the $MIND community, and use its growing online presence to promote them. Add in Telegram-based exclusive drops , staking rewards for presale buyers, and a constantly evolving intelligence system, and you’ve got more than a meme. You’ve got an autonomous hype engine. And with Ethereum likely to break $3K, this could be the moment where meme coin mania hits full throttle – again. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – The AI-Powered Engine Behind the Future of Creator Platforms SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is what happens when you combine the $85B creator economy with cutting-edge AI and the financial power of Ethereum. This ERC-20 token fuels the first AI-focused content creation and premium platform, built for influencers, artists, and fans tired of middlemen and hungry for control. Currently priced at $0.055525, with over $549K raised in its presale, $SUBBD is positioning itself as a serious contender in the Web3 creator space. At its core, $SUBBD gives creators and fans tools that just don’t exist on Web2 platforms. These include AI-powered content creation, automated fan engagement, crypto-based tipping and subscriptions, and token-gated access to exclusive content. Creators can use an integrated AI assistant to manage chats, schedule drops, edit content, and upsell subscriptions – all while retaining 100% ownership and significantly more revenue. No agents. No 50% cuts. Just freedom and smart automation. On the other side, people can generate short-form videos and realistic AI content based on their favorite creators, with permission. $SUBBD is the only platform where creators can approve AI-generated content of themselves, turning user-generated content into a two-way revenue funnel. Backed by a network with over 250M combined followers, $SUBBD has unmatched reach. Add instant crypto payments, 20% APY staking for $SUBBD presale buyers , and token-gated premium content, and you’ve got a sleek, scalable Web3 platform that’s ready to pop. As Ethereum builds energy toward the $3K mark, utility tokens like $SUBBD are well-positioned to catch the wave. 3. Punisher Coin ($PUN) – The Meme Coin That Declares War on the Competition As Ethereum gears up to break $3K, meme coins are flooding the market – but Punisher Coin ($PUN) isn’t just another bandwagon token. With bold, comic book-style branding and an anti-establishment tone, $PUN positions itself as the meme coin for those who are done with fluff and ready for a fight. Its standout feature? ‘Punisher Energy’ – a unique system that rewards users for ‘punishing’ rival meme coins like $SHIB and $BONK. Holders are encouraged to swap these tokens for $PUN and earn bonus rewards, turning competition into a growth engine. The project also runs daily missions that let users earn real $USDT and $PUN tokens for completing simple social and community tasks. The tokenomics are built to favor early adopters, with 0% buy and sell tax, a deflationary supply, and no vesting for presale participants. Combined with its aggressive branding and gamified mechanics, Punisher Coin offers more than just meme vibes – it offers strategy and engagement. So far, the presale has raised over $71K, and with 145 $PUN per 1 $USDT, the token is currently priced at approximately $0.0069, making it one of the best crypto presales for those seeking high-upside ERC-20 plays. Altcoin Season Nears – These Top Altcoins Could Ride Ethereum’s $3K Breakout With Ethereum pushing toward $3K, altcoin season may be just around the corner. Projects like Mind of Pepe ($MIND) , SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , and Punisher Coin ($PUN) are gaining momentum and stand out among the top altcoins right now. Each offers real utility, strong narratives, and ERC-20 compatibility – perfectly positioned to ride Ethereum’s next big move.

2025-05-29T12:45:52.000Z,"Bitcoin May Enter Sideways Phase Without Fresh Buying Pressure, Warns Willy Woo","Bitcoin’s recent price rally appears to be losing momentum, and a lack of strong buying this week could result in another extended consolidation period, according to on-chain analyst Willy Woo. Writing on X on May 28, Woo warned that the strength behind BTC rally from $75,000 on April 7 to its all-time high just under $112,000 on May 22 is “starting to break down.” “This week is absolutely critical,” Woo wrote. “If we do not get follow-through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” He pointed to the current behavior of speculators entering long positions late and noted signs of profit-taking based on the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which reflects the difference between buying and selling prices. Woo believes BTC is now in a “pivot zone,” with the outcome of this week’s price action likely to determine the trajectory for the next month or two. Despite the near-term risks, he remains optimistic about the bigger picture. “Buy-side liquidity is dominating,” Woo added, suggesting that long-term fundamentals remain strong. Pressure Builds Near Key Price Levels In addition to Woo’s remarks, analysts at crypto exchange Bitunix echoed concerns around a potential short-term pullback. They emphasized that BTC is facing technical resistance around $110,800 — a level where recent rallies have stalled and which now serves as a battleground between bullish and bearish traders. Support at $108,000 has proven significant over the past two days, but Bitunix cautioned that a break below this level could trigger more profit-taking and shift the market bias toward the downside. A slight rebound in U.S. consumer sentiment this week could provide a short-term boost to risk appetite, but analysts agree that without a clear breakout above resistance, Bitcoin may continue moving sideways for a while. Bitcoin Bold Predictions Amid Uncertain Near-Term Outlook Despite the immediate uncertainty, some big names remain highly bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects . Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump predicted BTC could hit $170,000 by the end of 2026. Meanwhile, Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back went even further , forecasting a $1 million BTC price within five years. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $108,785, with no major movement in the past 24 hours. It struggled to gain traction above $108,000 in early trading on May 29.

2025-05-29T12:45:40.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as UK’s Crypto Ownership Surges to Global Lead","On May 27, Gemini published its State of Crypto report , revealing that the United Kingdom vaulted ahead of every surveyed economy—including the United States—in year-over-year growth of new cryptocurrency holders. This surge comes even as London’s regulators have yet to roll out a full crypto rulebook, underscoring a grassroots momentum that’s rewriting adoption curves across Europe. With nearly one in four Britons now owning digital assets, the ripple effects could reshape both retail and institutional appetites, setting a precedent for markets still finding their footing. As investors weigh the shifting landscape and seek tactical entry points, savvy traders will be hunting the best crypto to buy now. UK Surpasses Global Crypto Adoption Rates, Leading the Way in Individual Ownership Growth The United Kingdom has outpaced all other surveyed nations in the climb of individual crypto ownership, soaring from 18% in April 2024 to 24% a year later, according to Gemini’s latest State of Crypto report. This leap places Britain ahead of economies such as the United States, France and Australia, despite London not yet enacting its own comprehensive crypto framework. The report, based on a poll of 7,200 adults across the U.S., Europe, Singapore and Australia, highlights Europe’s overall leadership in adoption—with Singapore still boasting the world’s highest ownership rate at 28%. France also saw notable gains, rising from 18% to 21%, while U.S. participation ticked up from 21% to 22%. Together, the combined ownership rates in these major markets climbed from 21% to 24% over the past year, suggesting nearly one-quarter of global respondents now hold cryptocurrency. Gemini attributes this broad upswing to a more favorable regulatory climate in Europe following the bear-market downturn of 2022 and to positive policy signals out of Washington that have lifted sentiment abroad. Despite its regulatory lag, Britain’s financial clout and reputation as a global hub appear to be drawing a fresh wave of enthusiasts eager to stake their claim on digital assets, signaling that crypto’s mainstream moment may be arriving sooner than many expected. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Britain’s crypto cohort swells and Europe braces for stricter MiCA rules, market liquidity and institutional interest are poised to climb. Demand signals from leading economies suggest that the tokens primed for breakout could enjoy tailwinds from both regulatory clarity and mass adoption. Savvy investors scanning the horizon will be eyeing the market, with the best cryptos to buy now on their radar. Snorter The United Kingdom’s report signals growing adoption of digital assets across the globe. And as more investors pivot to crypto as digital gold and hedge against inflation, they’ll need a fast bot that can help them automate every step of the on-chain trading workflow, capitalizing on every potential market opportunity before it becomes public knowledge. Enter Snorter , the fastest and lowest-fee Telegram-native trading bot, designed to deliver sub-second sub-second execution and MEV resistant routing. No delays, no missed entries—it’s purpose-built to ensure instant swaps and help investors gain entry into trending meme coins quickly so that they can take the most advantage of their parabolic price movements. A key aspect of Snorter is its on-chain scanner, which automatically detects every rugpull, honeypot, stealth trap, or any other common rug vectors. Other premium features include automated copy trading, scheduled limit orders and stop-losses, and portfolio tracker with live P&L. The fact that each of the aforementioned features is accessible directly on Telegram streamlines the overall trading experience. And unlike other sniper bots that are limited to a single chain, Snorter has a multichain appeal. It took off with Solana, with plans to expand to other EVM-compatible chains soon. Considering the importance of its use cases—especially as nations pivot to crypto—it’s no surprise that the project’s presale has seen strong demand within hours of launch, raising over $150k. And that’s not even all! Prominent publications such as NewsBTC, Cryptonomist, and others have positively reviewed the project, highlighting its significance to the crypto trading landscape. Best Wallet Token With more Britons logging into crypto wallets than ever, Best Wallet Token powers a secure gateway for new investors stepping onto the digital asset stage—offering intuitive features that match today’s adoption surge. Best Wallet lets users explore new projects early through its “Upcoming Tokens” section, helping them identify potential breakout tokens before they gain widespread attention. With connections to over 200 DeFi protocols and 20 cross-chain bridges, it significantly reduces fees and accelerates trade execution compared to competitors. Users can trade instantly via the built-in DEX, bypassing centralized exchanges and minimizing exposure to third-party risks. Fiat conversions are handled directly in-app, streamlining the process of buying crypto or cashing out without the need for external exchanges. Additionally, the upcoming Best Card, powered by MoonPay and Alchemy Pay, will transform crypto into everyday spending power, allowing users to swipe their holdings for purchases wherever traditional cards are accepted. Solaxy Tapping into the Solana ecosystem’s explosive growth, Solaxy’s Layer-2 scaling solution supercharges transactions and slashes fees—making it an ideal play for investors chasing network-wide adoption. Solaxy ($SOLX) has smashed the $42 million presale milestone as Solana’s First Layer-2 Solution. Investors rush to secure tokens before the 18-day countdown ends, eyeing long-term scalability gains. Built to combat Solana’s congestion woes, Solaxy offloads transactions off-chain, bundling them for faster, smoother mainnet processing—even during peak traffic surges. Tokenomics fuel optimism: 25% of supply funds staking rewards, while 30% backs development, balancing hype with infrastructure growth. Institutions eye Solana for real-world asset tokenization, raising stakes for $SOLX—its success could amplify demand for both Solana and its Layer-2 counterpart. $SOLX reigns supreme. 🛸41M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/uEUXlekkL0 — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 27, 2025 Early adopters stake presale tokens for up to 98% APY, locking in gains before exchange listings spark potential price rallies. SUBBD Riding the tide of growing European regulatory clarity, SUBBD provides cross-chain bridges and staking incentives—perfect for those staking a claim on blockchain interoperability as the market matures. SUBBD shifts from meme coin roots, focusing on blockchain tools to strengthen creator-fan relationships through direct crypto interactions. The platform streamlines support and payments using crypto, cutting through traditional banking delays and middlemen fees for smoother transactions. A 20% staking reward offers long-term incentives, adding practical value rarely seen in new crypto projects aiming beyond hype. Unlike platforms requiring viral luck, SUBBD boosts creator visibility through consistent engagement while automating tasks like scheduling and messaging. Hiring help drains earnings—after fees, creators often keep just 30-40%, pushing demand for SUBBD’s cost-cutting tools. BTC Bull As the UK’s survey shows confidence in Bitcoin spreading like wildfire, BTC Bull captures that bullish momentum with leveraged exposure, letting traders amplify gains as mainstream interest roars to life. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) emerges as a novel Bitcoin-linked investment vehicle, rewarding holders with real BTC airdrops at key price milestones like $150K or $200K. The project’s presale surged past $6.5 million, driven by its unique incentive model that ties token ownership to Bitcoin’s price performance. At Bitcoin’s $250K milestone, BTCBULL plans an exclusive token airdrop, reserving 10% of its total supply for this event to boost long-term engagement. This hybrid reward system—combining Bitcoin and token distributions—positions BTCBULL as a speculative darling while hedging bets on BTC’s continued rally Ethereum Fueling decentralized finance across the continent, Ethereum stands tall as smart contract demand explodes; its network effect makes ETH a core holding for anyone betting on crypto’s next chapter. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade went live earlier this month, targeting smoother developer experience. The update follows rigorous testing, aiming to solidify Ethereum’s dominance in smart contracts. Vitalik Buterin argues Ethereum must mimic cash’s privacy and offline resilience, calling it a critical “fallback” as digital payments phase out physical money. Despite cash’s declining role, Buterin stresses the need for decentralized alternatives, urging Ethereum to bake in crash-resistant, private transaction features long-term. “Ethereum’s already ahead here,” he noted, acknowledging technical hurdles but highlighting progress in balancing complexity with real-world usability. In technical terms, it is currently trading at around $2725 with a market cap of $329 billion, securing its position in 2nd place. It has shown a 3.18% growth in the past 24 hours, suggesting that the saturation point is still far off, creating an opportunity for potential buyers to capitalize on upcoming opportunities. The push aligns with growing demand for systems that blend old-school cash traits with blockchain’s speed—a tightrope walk between innovation and tradition. As stated by well-known crypto YouTuber Cilinix Crypto , Ethereum is set to deliver parabolic returns. Conclusion Gemini’s report casts the United Kingdom as the unexpected leader in crypto adoption, reminding investors that regulatory lag doesn’t always throttle growth. Instead, Britain’s rise spotlights how market maturity and financial heritage can converge to accelerate mainstream uptake. As Europe finalizes MiCA and U.S. policy continues to influence global sentiment, the path ahead favors assets that balance institutional backing with vibrant retail interest. For traders mapping this evolving terrain, the best crypto to buy now has never been more compelling. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-05-29T12:43:08.000Z,"While Bitcoin is in a Narrow Range, Whales' Behavior is Changing Remarkably! Here Are the Details","While the Bitcoin price has been trading sideways in a narrow range between $107,000 and $109,000, on-chain data reveals a notable shift in the behavior of “whales,” some of the largest and most influential participants in the market. Are Bitcoin Whales Signaling a Peak? According to the data, large investors may have moved from the accumulation phase to the distribution phase. The Accumulation Trend Score provided by Glassnode further illustrates this trend. This metric measures the accumulation power of investors based on the size of wallets and BTC purchases made in the last 15 days. Values close to 1 indicate strong buying, while values close to 0 indicate a selling trend. A more robust data set is obtained by excluding exchange and miner wallets from the analysis. The score of whales with assets of 10,000 BTC and above in this metric has currently dropped to 0.4. This level shows that whales have started to take sell positions after the aggressive buying levels of $75,000 in April. Other wallet categories are still in accumulation mode. This strategic change in direction by whales may be due to their desire to take profits or to take a more cautious stance on short-term price movements. Another indicator of this change comes from exchange flow data. While whales have been showing a positive picture over the last month, showing that they have not sold by withdrawing BTC from their wallets to exchanges, they have been seen to have deposited BTC back into exchanges in two of the last three days. This movement is generally known as a pattern observed before the sale. In light of these developments, Bitcoin continues to trade very close to its all-time highs, but whale behavior reinforces signals that the market could be entering a correction phase. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to regain momentum and has slipped below $108,000 over the past 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $107,900. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $2,700, up almost 4% over the past 24 hours, as buyers look to build momentum and push towards $3,000. Ripple (XRP) continued trading in the red, with the price registering a marginal decline and falling to $2.28.

US Federal Court Blocks Trump Tariffs Futures surged early Thursday after a federal court pushed back President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. The US Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority when he imposed reciprocal tariffs and ordered the challenged tariff orders be vacated. Trump’s ever-changing approach towards tariffs and trade policies and concerns about inflation have spooked markets, with companies dialing back forecasts and traders adopting a wait-and-watch approach. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares jumped almost 5% during after-hours trading after the chipmaker exceeded expectations on its top and bottom lines for the first quarter, as its data center business registered a year-over-year growth of 73%. James Demmert, Chief Investment Officer of Main Street Research, stated, “Wednesday’s Nvidia earnings report is pivotal not just for Nvidia but for the entire stock market, as it can rejuvenate investor optimism across the board and help investors to focus on the power of AI and less on headlines out of Washington on tariffs and taxes.” Dow Registers Drop As Fed Minutes Rattle Markets US stocks closed lower Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve released minutes from its May policy meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Indices fell 0.56% and 0.51%. The Fed indicated a cautious approach to monetary policy and warned of “difficult tradeoffs” if inflation persisted. “Participants agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had increased further, making it appropriate to take a cautious approach until the net economic effects of the array of changes to government policies become clearer. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proves to be more persistent while the outlooks for growth and employment weaken.” Circle Freezes USDC Linked To LIBRA Scandal Circle has frozen nearly $58 million in USDC connected with the LIBRA memecoin scandal. Blockchain analysts from Arkham noted that Circle had frozen two Solana wallets linked with the LIBRA deployer and project team. Both wallets held a combined $57 million in USDC. Circle’s multisig freeze authority conducted the freeze. “ALERT: $57M OF USDC ASSOCIATED WITH LIBRA FROZEN BY CIRCLE Two Libra accounts have just been frozen by Circle, including the Libra deployer wallet. These accounts contained a combined $57M in USDC, which is now immobile.” The freeze is part of a class-action lawsuit filed in March in the Southern District of New York, with LIBRA investors suing Kelsier Ventures and its founders, Gideon, Thomas, and Hayden Davis. Benjamin Chow, a co-founder of Meteora, Julian Peh of KIP Protocol, and organizations that helped in the development and marketing of the LIBRA token are among the other defendants. Crypto Mining Stocks Plummet US crypto mining stocks dropped after minutes published by the Federal Reserve indicated growing uncertainty about the economy’s outlook. According to the minutes, the Fed may face a difficult tradeoff if inflation persists and the outlook for growth and employment weakens. The Fed has kept interest rates steady between 4.25% and 4.50% due to growing uncertainty about the economic outlook and an increase in the risk of higher unemployment and higher inflation. Riot Platforms closed the May 28 trading day down over 8%, while CleanSpark (CLSDK) fell 7.61%, and MARA Holdings dropped almost 10%. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) also fell 4.55%, while Michael Saylor’s Strategy extended its downtrend, dropping over 2%. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a notable decline on Wednesday, falling over 1% as it briefly dipped below $107,000 to an intraday low of $106,856 before reclaiming $107,000 and settling at $107,834. The flagship cryptocurrency’s price action has been subdued after last week’s rally, thanks to buyer exhaustion and profit-taking at higher levels. Despite BTC’s subdued price action this week, it is up nearly 15% over the past month. Additionally, analysts believe the overall sentiment around BTC remains positive despite a pullback to $107,000. CryptoQuant contributor Burak Kesmeci highlighted Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and the importance of the 365-day Simple Moving Average as a benchmark for the MVRV metric. Historically, when the MVRV crosses and maintains weekly closes above the SMA365, it indicates sustained upward momentum. Meanwhile, long-term BTC holders have transferred $4.02 billion in BTC, the largest spending volume from the 1-to-5-year cohorts since February 2025. The surge is driven by the 3-to-5-year cohort ($2.16 billion), the fifth-largest this cycle. The 2-to-3-year and 1-to-2-year cohorts contributed $1.41 billion and $450 million, respectively. BTC has traded in a narrow range between $105,000 and $110,000 since Friday as it consolidates close to its all-time high. However, its trend into price discovery remains intact, with analysts pointing out that the price is consolidating above previous highs. BTC ended the previous week in positive territory, rising over 3% and settling at $106,489. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,582. However, price action turned bearish on Friday, and BTC plunged nearly 4% to settle at $107,356. Source: TradingView Price action turned positive over the weekend as BTC 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,095. The current week started positively as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $109,453. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $108,951. Selling pressure intensified on Wednesday as BTC fell over 1% to a low of $106,856 before settling at $107,834. The current session sees BTC up nearly 1% as buyers look to build momentum and push the price toward $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $2,700 after registering an increase of nearly 5% in the past 24 hours as institutional interest in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency returned. The move past $2,700 sees ETH extend its impressive performance, with the price rising over 50% during the past month. ETH’s recovery comes after a difficult Q1, during which the asset’s price plummeted over 40%. Spot Ethereum ETFs have also attracted $402 million in inflows over the past month, according to data from SoSoValue. Industry leaders are pushing the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve staking for Ethereum ETFs. If the SEC approves these requests, Ethereum ETFs could register even more inflows. ETH’s recovery can also be credited to large-scale ETH purchases by institutions. Between May 7 and May 21, Abraxas Capital purchased over 350,000 ETH, worth around $837 million. The firm also transferred 185,000 ETH from centralized exchanges, indicating long-term conviction about the asset’s price. Trading firm DRW also made a $150 million investment in ETH in April, while online gambling firm SharpLink Gaming raised $425 million to establish an ETH treasury. ETH ended the previous weekend facing volatility and selling pressure but registered an increase of nearly 1% and settled at $2,498. The price fell to an intraday low of $2,349 on Monday before rebounding to register a rise of 1.18% and settle at $2,527. ETH registered a marginal decline on Tuesday but rebounded on Wednesday to register an increase of 1.10% despite volatility and selling pressure. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rose over 4% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,664. The price reached an intraday high of $2,731 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level, falling over 5% to $2,525. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH rebounded over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $2,551. ETH started the current week positively, registering a marginal increase and moving to $2,564. Buying pressure increased on Tuesday as ETH rose almost 4% to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,662. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as ETH rose nearly 1% and settled at $2,683. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,791 during the ongoing session before declining and moving to its current level of $2,720. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) faced rejection from the $180 level yet again, falling nearly 3% on Wednesday after reaching an intraday high of $179 a day prior. While SOL has been unsuccessful in establishing a sustained bullish position at this level, it has maintained a positive signal by crossing the 50-week exponential moving average for three consecutive weeks. SOL is still trading significantly lower than its all-time high. However, Coinglass data shows futures market activity remains robust, with SOL futures open interest at $7.5 billion, just 1 billion short of its $8.5 billion peak. High open interest indicates speculative interest, suggesting traders are positioning themselves for volatility. Funding rates have also turned negative, indicating a pivot towards short positions. While this reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the potential of a short squeeze. SOL started the previous week in the red, dropping nearly 4% to $166. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, SOL rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.05% and settling at $168. The price continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising almost 3% to cross $170 and settling at $173. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL registered an increase of nearly 4% and settled at $179. SOL raced to an intraday day high of $187 on Friday as buying pressure increased. However, it could not stay at this level, ultimately dropping over 3% to $173. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as SOL rose 1.09% on Saturday before registering a marginal decline on Sunday and settling at $175. SOl started the current week in the red, registering a marginal decline on Monday. However, it recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.03% and settling at $176. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday, and SOL fell almost 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $172. The current session sees SOL marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Chainlink (LINK) registered a steep decline on Monday (May 19), as it plunged to an intraday low of $14.85 before rebounding to settle at $15.78, ultimately registering a marginal decline.

2025-05-29T12:34:21.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is BTC’s Rally Sustainable or Due for a Pullback?","Bitcoin continues to hold around the $108,000 mark, consolidating within a narrow range after a sharp rally from April lows. Price action suggests strength, but momentum has cooled slightly, setting the stage for a critical few days ahead. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC remains above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are located in the $90,000 – $96,000 range, and have also crossed bullishly in recent weeks. The RSI sits around 63, showing that the rally isn’t yet overheated but is nearing the upper range. A healthy consolidation around the $108,000 level could serve as a base for another leg up, provided bullish momentum holds and volume supports a breakout. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows a rising channel structure, and despite a recent breakdown of the lower trendline, the price has convincingly defended the horizontal support level at $106,000. This area has now become an intraday support zone. The RSI is around the neutral 50 level, suggesting balanced momentum after a brief correction. A clean break and close above $109,000 and a return inside the channel could trigger a push towards the $112,000–115,000 range, while any breakdown below $106,000 might open the door for a short-term pullback toward the $102,000–$100,000 region. Sentiment Analysis Exchange Reserve On-chain data continues to support a bullish bias. Exchange reserves are at their lowest level in years, now sitting around 2.4 million BTC. This sustained and aggressive decline reinforces the idea that investors are moving BTC off exchanges, likely for long-term storage, reducing sell-side liquidity. With supply tightening and price climbing, the conditions remain ripe for higher valuations, especially if macro conditions stay favorable and demand from institutional channels remains strong.

2025-05-29T12:30:38.000Z,"US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: $433.66M Added in Powerful 10-Day Streak","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: $433.66M Added in Powerful 10-Day Streak Guess what’s happening in the world of digital assets? The US Spot Bitcoin ETF market is absolutely buzzing! After a period of mixed sentiment, these investment vehicles are once again attracting significant capital, signaling renewed confidence among investors. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows According to data shared by Trader T on X, May 28 saw a remarkable influx into US-based spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The total net inflow for the day reached an impressive $433.66 million . This isn’t just a one-off event; it extends a notable trend that has been building momentum. This figure represents the tenth consecutive trading day where these ETFs have seen more money flow in than out. A ten-day streak is a strong indicator of sustained buying pressure and potentially shifting market dynamics. It suggests that demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure through these familiar investment products remains robust. Let’s break down the key players in this latest inflow report: BlackRock’s IBIT: Once again, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the pack, recording substantial inflows of $482 million . IBIT has consistently been a dominant force since its launch, quickly accumulating billions in assets under management. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Not all funds saw positive movement. ARK Invest’s ARKB experienced outflows totaling $34.29 million on May 28. Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also saw a net outflow, albeit smaller, amounting to $14.05 million . Other BTC ETF Products: The report indicated that other existing US Spot Bitcoin ETF products recorded no significant change in their holdings for the day. This snapshot shows a clear divergence, with BlackRock’s IBIT continuing to attract significant capital, while some others faced minor redemptions. However, the overall net figure remains strongly positive due to IBIT’s large inflow. Why Does This 10-Day Streak of BTC ETF Inflows Matter? A consistent streak of inflows, especially one reaching ten consecutive days, is highly significant for several reasons: Sustained Demand: It indicates that institutional and retail investors are consistently buying into these funds, rather than just making sporadic investments. This suggests underlying confidence. Market Support: Every dollar flowing into a spot Bitcoin ETF theoretically requires the fund manager to purchase an equivalent amount of actual Bitcoin on the open market. This creates consistent buying pressure, which can provide support for Bitcoin’s price. Growing Adoption: The sustained inflows underscore the increasing adoption of Bitcoin as an asset class through traditional investment channels like ETFs. This is a major step towards mainstream acceptance. Liquidity and Maturity: As these funds grow larger, they add liquidity to the Bitcoin market and contribute to its overall maturity as an asset class. While $433.66 million is a substantial daily figure, the real story is the endurance of the inflow trend. It suggests a potential shift in sentiment following previous periods of outflows or sideways movement. How Does BlackRock IBIT Continue to Dominate the Crypto ETF Landscape? BlackRock’s IBIT has been a standout performer since the launch of the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Its ability to consistently attract the largest share of inflows warrants a closer look. Several factors likely contribute to IBIT’s success: Brand Recognition: BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager with a long-standing reputation in traditional finance. This provides a level of trust and familiarity that appeals to large institutional investors and financial advisors. Distribution Network: BlackRock has an extensive distribution network, making it easier for financial professionals and their clients to access IBIT. Liquidity: Due to its large asset base and trading volume, IBIT is highly liquid, which is attractive to large investors who need to enter and exit positions efficiently. Competitive Fees: While fees vary, IBIT’s fee structure is competitive within the spot Bitcoin ETF market. The dominance of BlackRock IBIT highlights how traditional finance players entering the crypto space can quickly capture significant market share, leveraging their existing infrastructure and reputation. What Do These US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Mean for the Future? The continued positive trend in US Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows is generally seen as a bullish signal for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Here are some potential implications and things to watch: Potential Benefits: Price Appreciation: Sustained buying pressure from ETFs can help drive Bitcoin’s price higher. Increased Legitimacy: Growing assets under management in these regulated products further legitimizes Bitcoin as a viable investment asset. Wider Investor Base: ETFs make it easier for a broader range of investors, including those in retirement accounts or traditional brokerage platforms, to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Potential Challenges & Considerations: Market Volatility: While inflows are positive, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. ETF flows can reverse, leading to selling pressure. Correlation: The performance of BTC ETFs is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin. Investors are still exposed to the asset’s price swings. Dependence on Macro Factors: Bitcoin’s price and ETF flows can still be influenced by broader economic conditions and regulatory news. Actionable Insight: Investors interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated means should monitor these inflow trends closely, but also consider the broader market context and their own risk tolerance. Diversification remains key. Concluding Thoughts on the Powerful Inflow Streak The streak of ten consecutive days of net inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs, culminating in a strong $433.66 million day on May 28, is a significant development. It underscores the enduring appeal of Bitcoin as an asset and the growing importance of regulated investment vehicles like the Crypto ETF in providing access to it. While individual funds like ARK Invest’s ARKB and Fidelity’s FBTC saw minor outflows, the overall picture, heavily influenced by the consistent strength of BlackRock IBIT, is one of positive momentum. This trend provides fundamental support for Bitcoin and signals increasing integration of digital assets into traditional finance.

2025-05-29T12:30:00.000Z,"Donut Labs raises $7M to launch first ‘agentic’ crypto browser","New York-based Donut Labs has raised $7 million in a pre-seed funding round to build what it claims is the world’s first “agentic” crypto browser — a tool designed to help users interact with blockchain-based applications using artificial intelligence. The round was led by Sequoia, Bitkraft and HackVC, with participation from angel investors including Solana and other ecosystem leaders, such as Matrix Partners, Sky9 Ventures, Makers Fund and SonicSVM. The $7 million will support the development of Donut, an executable crypto browser powered by artificial intelligence agents, with a native cryptocurrency wallet and decentralized exchange integration, decentralized network access and onchain execution. Unlike traditional web browsers, Donut’s AI algorithms understand page context and user intent, helping it autonomously execute blockchain-based operations. “The traditional browser hasn’t changed for more than 30 years. We’re re-architecting everything,” said Donut founder and CEO Chris Zhu. “We’re reconstructing the front end of the internet to be hyper-financialized for AI agents.” Donut closes $7 million pre-seed round. Source: Donut Related: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin ‘premium’ nears $600K per BTC Donut’s users will gain access to an array of decentralized tools and crypto services under a single agentic interface, which could make digital asset transactions safer. “Architecturally isolated signing environments and AI-powered risk screening secure every transaction while optimizing execution for speed and cost,” said Zhu, adding that “AI translates opaque calldata into plain English and assigns safety grades.” Donut’s AI agents can trade or swap tokens, place bets, or earn passive yield on digital assets. Related: Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoption Agentic browsers could reshape internet in next decade While Donut’s earliest adopters will likely be crypto traders, builders or decentralized finance (DeFi) users, agentic browsers may explode into the mainstream during the next decade. Within the next five years, Ethereum layer-2 (L2) networks will use agentic browsers to cut settlement costs. Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu. However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding: “Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.” In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

Peter Schiff argues Bitcoin isn’t real wealth and gold is safer. Trump’s media firm plans a $2.5B raise, including a Bitcoin treasury.

Vance told the crowd that 50 million Americans already own Bitcoin, and their goal is to double that number to 100 million.

Many in the crypto community cheered these comments, seeing it as a signal for a more supportive government approach towards digital assets.

2025-05-29T12:20:35.000Z,"Bitcoin-Backed Loans Revolutionizing Real Estate and Golf Entertainment via SALT Lending Deal","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin-Backed Loans Revolutionizing Real Estate and Golf Entertainment via SALT Lending Deal Imagine accessing significant capital for your business without selling off your valuable digital assets. That’s the power of Bitcoin-backed loans , and a recent announcement involving SALT Lending is putting this concept into the mainstream spotlight in a big way. Unpacking the Groundbreaking SALT Lending Deal In a move that highlights the increasing convergence of digital assets and traditional finance, SALT Lending , a prominent provider of loans collateralized by cryptocurrencies, has inked a significant letter of intent (LOI). This agreement is set to provide a substantial $105 million in Bitcoin-backed financing to two distinct companies: GolfSuites 1 Inc. and ERC Communities 1 Inc. This isn’t just a small pilot program; it’s a nine-figure commitment demonstrating serious confidence in using Bitcoin as collateral for large-scale business ventures. The funding is strategically allocated: $35 million is earmarked for GolfSuites 1 Inc. This capital will fuel the expansion of their golf-entertainment facilities, a growing sector that blends sports, leisure, and social experiences. $70 million is designated for ERC Communities 1 Inc. This larger portion will support the development of build-to-rent manufactured-home communities, addressing a significant need in the real estate market for attainable housing solutions. Shawn Owen, CEO of SALT Lending, emphasized the significance of this deal, stating, “This transaction exemplifies how bitcoin can unlock growth in mainstream industries like golf entertainment and attainable housing.” His statement underscores the potential for digital assets to serve as powerful financial tools beyond speculative trading. How Do Bitcoin-Backed Loans Work? The Over-Collateralization Model A key element mentioned in the announcement is the use of an over-collateralized Bitcoin structure . But what exactly does that mean, and why is it used? In simple terms, over-collateralization means the borrower puts up more value in Bitcoin than the amount of fiat currency (like USD) they receive as a loan. For example, to borrow $100,000, a borrower might need to pledge $150,000 or $200,000 worth of Bitcoin. Here’s why this structure is crucial, especially in the world of crypto lending : Mitigating Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly. Over-collateralization provides a buffer against potential price drops. If the value of the pledged Bitcoin falls, the lender is still protected because the collateral’s initial value was significantly higher than the loan amount. Protecting Lenders and Investors: This buffer protects the lender (SALT Lending) and the investors who fund these loans. It reduces the risk of the collateral value falling below the outstanding loan amount, which could result in losses. Ensuring Loan Security: By requiring more collateral than the loan value, the lender has a higher degree of security. If the borrower defaults, the lender can liquidate the collateral to recover the loan amount, even if the asset’s price has decreased. Facilitating Access to Capital: For the borrower, this structure allows them to access needed capital without selling their Bitcoin. This is particularly attractive for individuals or businesses who are bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term value and don’t want to incur capital gains taxes or lose potential future appreciation. The level of over-collateralization (often expressed as a Loan-to-Value or LTV ratio) varies depending on the lender, the volatility of the asset, and market conditions. Lower LTVs (meaning higher over-collateralization) offer greater safety for the lender but require the borrower to tie up more capital. Why Choose Digital Asset Lending Over Traditional Finance? For companies like GolfSuites and ERC Communities, tapping into digital asset lending might offer several compelling advantages over traditional bank loans: Speed and Flexibility: Crypto lending platforms can often process loan applications and disburse funds much faster than traditional banks, which can be crucial for time-sensitive business opportunities. Access to Capital Without Selling Assets: This is perhaps the biggest draw. Businesses holding significant amounts of Bitcoin or other digital assets can leverage them for liquidity without triggering taxable events or sacrificing potential future gains from holding the asset. Potentially Broader Eligibility: Traditional lenders may have rigid criteria. Crypto lending platforms might offer more flexible terms or access to capital for businesses that find it difficult to secure traditional financing. Diversification of Funding Sources: Relying on a mix of traditional and digital asset financing can be a smart business strategy, providing alternative avenues for capital. This deal signals a growing acceptance of digital assets as legitimate forms of collateral in the financial world, opening up new funding avenues for businesses in diverse sectors. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the benefits are clear, Bitcoin-backed loans and crypto lending , in general, are not without their risks: Volatility Risk: Although over-collateralization helps, a drastic and rapid drop in Bitcoin’s price can still lead to margin calls (requiring the borrower to add more collateral) or even liquidation of the collateral if the LTV ratio crosses a certain threshold. Liquidation Risk: Losing your pledged Bitcoin due to price drops is a significant risk. If your collateral is liquidated, you lose your Bitcoin holdings. Platform Risk: Borrowers rely on the lending platform’s security and reliability. Hacks, operational failures, or regulatory issues could impact the loan or the safety of the collateral. Interest Rates: Interest rates on crypto loans can sometimes be higher than traditional loans, depending on market conditions and the specific platform. Businesses considering this type of financing must have a clear understanding of these risks and a strategy for managing potential volatility, such as maintaining a healthy collateral buffer well above the liquidation threshold. Real Estate and Golf Entertainment: Unexpected Beneficiaries? It might seem counterintuitive to see industries like real estate development and golf entertainment tapping into Bitcoin-backed financing. However, this deal illustrates a key point: capital is capital, regardless of its source. For businesses in capital-intensive sectors, accessing $105 million can be transformative for expansion and development plans. The real estate sector, in particular, is always seeking innovative financing solutions. Build-to-rent communities require significant upfront investment, and leveraging digital assets provides an alternative funding path. Similarly, expanding entertainment venues demands substantial capital, and this deal shows that even leisure industries are exploring new financial frontiers. This trend of traditional industries utilizing digital asset lending is likely to continue as awareness and acceptance of cryptocurrencies grow within the broader financial ecosystem. The Future of Digital Asset Lending The SALT Lending deal is more than just a one-off transaction; it’s a sign of maturation in the crypto lending space. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional confidence builds, we can expect to see more diverse businesses and industries exploring the potential of using digital assets as collateral. This could include everything from small business loans to large corporate financing, all powered by the value stored in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The infrastructure for managing, valuing, and securing digital assets for lending purposes is becoming more robust, paving the way for broader adoption. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Bitcoin in Mainstream Finance SALT Lending’s commitment to provide $105 million in Bitcoin-backed loans for real estate and golf entertainment marks a significant milestone. It clearly demonstrates the growing utility of Bitcoin as a legitimate financial tool capable of unlocking substantial capital for businesses in traditional sectors. While risks associated with volatility remain, the over-collateralization model provides a framework for managing these challenges. This deal is a compelling example of how digital asset lending is bridging the gap between the crypto world and the broader economy, creating new opportunities for growth and investment across diverse industries. It’s a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role beyond a speculative asset, positioning it as a key player in the future of finance.

2025-05-29T12:19:00.000Z,"Hawk Tuah Girl Crypto Coin Hype Fades: Meanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris Beta Testers Report $500+ Weekly Passive Income","Every bull run has its mascots. From Dogecoin’s Shiba to today’s Hawk Tuah Girl meme coin, hype can take a token far, for a moment. But what happens after the headlines fade? Investors seeking more than internet flair are starting to shift their gaze, not just toward another token, but toward a full infrastructure play: Bitcoin Solaris. It’s not about catching the next meme wave—it’s about catching the next decade of crypto growth. And for a growing number of early testers, Bitcoin Solaris is already delivering what hype coins only promise: real, stable, weekly income. That’s not speculation. That’s execution. Hawk Tuah and the Hype Hangover To be clear, Hawk Tuah Girl Crypto Coin has had its moment. The virality sparked social buzz and instant FOMO. But like so many memecoins before it, the path from meme to millionaire isn’t paved with tech—it’s paved with timing. And timing rarely favors those who enter late.

Previous signals mostly resulted in a BTC price blow-off top over the coming year. Market commentators remain firmly bullish on price trajectory during consolidation after Bitcoin’s latest all-time high. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is prepared for its “next major leg up” as a long-term indicator triggers for the first time since mid-2024. Analysis uploaded to X by trading account Stockmoney Lizards on May 28 described an “obvious” BTC price breakout signal. Analysis on Bitcoin breakout signal: “We’re there” Bitcoin is ready to repeat its run to a cycle top, just like in 2016 and 2020, Stockmoney Lizards reports. The Optimized Trend Tracker (OTT) tool, which offers price trend insights using moving averages and average true range data, is primed for Bitcoin’s next blow-off top. “The pattern is so obvious it hurts,” the X post claims, calling OTT the “cleanest trend indicator you can use for macro moves.” In previous cycles, price retested the cluster of OTT trend lines, going on to highs after cementing them as support. This time, two retest episodes have occurred, with the latter now appearing to come to an end. “We just broke out of the monthly OTT bands. Again,” the post concludes. “OTT bands show you when assets are ready for their next major leg up - and we're there.” Bitcoin OTT data.

2025-05-29T12:12:22.000Z,"XRP Faces Diminishing Momentum Amid Deepening Consolidation: Ripple Price Analysis","XRP is still caught in a long-term consolidation phase, showing neither significant bullish momentum nor complete breakdown confirmation. Both the XRP/USDT and XRP/BTC pairs reflect this indecisiveness, with price action tightening within well-defined patterns. Technical Analysis The USDT Pair Starting with XRP/USDT, the price continues to compress within a descending channel. The upper resistance trendline from the January high remains unbroken, while the horizontal demand zone near the $2 level has acted as strong support multiple times. XRP is now hovering right above the 100-day (orange) and 200-day (blue) moving averages around the $2.3 level. The RSI is also flat around 48, showing a lack of momentum in either direction. The longer XRP fails to break above the descending resistance, the more vulnerable it becomes to a breakdown, especially if Bitcoin begins a retracement phase. The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, XRP is hovering just above key support at 2200 SAT, a level that has repeatedly held since mid-April. The pair has been trending lower within a descending channel, compressing against horizontal support. Both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are now flattening out above the current price, and around the 2500 SAT mark, acting as key dynamic resistance levels. This setup reflects a bearish bias unless the buyers can reclaim 2400 SAT and push out of the descending channel and above the moving averages. The momentum is also clearly weakening, as reflected by the RSI sitting near 30, indicating a lack of bullish strength. If the 2200 SAT demand zone is lost, XRP/BTC could quickly slide to the 1600-1800 SAT range, which is the next visible demand zone due to imbalances (fair value gaps) formed in December last year.

2025-05-29T12:10:12.000Z,"Metaplanet Unleashes Bold $21M Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy in Japan","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Unleashes Bold $21M Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy in Japan Get ready for some significant moves from the East! A prominent Japanese publicly listed company, Metaplanet , is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy, making waves in both the traditional finance and cryptocurrency worlds. They’ve just announced a substantial financial maneuver aimed squarely at boosting their Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet’s Latest Bold Step: Issuing Bonds for More BTC In a move that echoes the strategies of other forward-thinking corporations globally, Metaplanet shared via an announcement on X that it intends to issue 1 billion Japanese Yen (which translates to approximately $21 million USD at current exchange rates) in 0% Ordinary Bonds. But here’s the exciting part for crypto enthusiasts: the primary purpose of issuing these bonds is explicitly stated as acquiring additional BTC . This isn’t Metaplanet’s first rodeo when it comes to embracing the leading cryptocurrency. They have been steadily accumulating Bitcoin over the past year, positioning themselves as a ‘Bitcoin company’ in the Japanese market. This latest announcement, however, represents a significant escalation of that strategy, leveraging traditional debt markets to finance their digital asset purchases. Issuing 0% bonds is particularly noteworthy. It suggests Metaplanet is capitalizing on favorable financing conditions, potentially reflecting low-interest-rate environments or strong investor confidence in the company’s overall direction and its Bitcoin -centric strategy. By using debt that incurs no interest cost, they can acquire BTC without the drag of ongoing interest payments, a potentially highly efficient way to leverage their balance sheet for asset acquisition. Why is Metaplanet Betting Big on Bitcoin? Understanding Metaplanet’s rationale requires looking at the broader economic landscape and the specific appeal of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Companies like Metaplanet and MicroStrategy (a notable example from the US) view BTC not just as a speculative asset, but as a long-term store of value and a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Several factors likely influence Metaplanet’s decision: Macroeconomic Environment: Concerns about potential currency weakening or inflation can drive companies to seek alternative assets outside of traditional fiat holdings. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, is often seen as a digital equivalent to gold in this regard. Long-Term Value Proposition: Many investors and corporations believe Bitcoin ‘s value will appreciate significantly over time due to increasing adoption, network effects, and its scarcity. Balance Sheet Optimization: Holding a portion of treasury reserves in BTC can potentially offer higher returns compared to traditional low-yield assets, albeit with higher volatility. Differentiation: For a company like Metaplanet, embracing Bitcoin can also be a strategic move to differentiate itself in the market and attract investors interested in the crypto space. This strategy isn’t without its risks, primarily the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market. However, Metaplanet’s repeated actions suggest a strong conviction in the long-term upside of Bitcoin despite potential short-term price swings. Comparing Metaplanet’s Strategy: A Japanese MicroStrategy? It’s impossible to discuss Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy without drawing parallels to MicroStrategy, the US-based software company that has become synonymous with corporate BTC accumulation. MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has aggressively used debt and equity offerings to acquire vast amounts of Bitcoin , turning itself into the largest corporate holder of the asset. While Metaplanet’s scale is currently smaller than MicroStrategy’s, their approach is strikingly similar: using financial instruments to finance significant BTC purchases and explicitly adopting a Bitcoin -first treasury strategy. This positions Metaplanet as a potential leader in promoting institutional adoption of Bitcoin within Japan . Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Metaplanet (Japan) MicroStrategy (USA) Primary Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) Strategy Acquiring BTC for treasury Acquiring BTC for treasury Financing Methods Bonds (latest $21M) Debt & Equity Offerings Market Japan Global (primarily US-listed) Current Scale (BTC holdings) Growing, smaller than MSTR Largest corporate holder Metaplanet’s move is significant because it demonstrates that this corporate treasury strategy is gaining traction beyond the US and is finding fertile ground in major Asian economies like Japan . What Does This Mean for Institutional Adoption in Japan? Metaplanet’s decision is a powerful signal for institutional adoption within Japan . As a publicly listed company making such a clear and significant commitment to Bitcoin , they are paving the way and setting a precedent for other Japanese corporations. For a long time, the narrative around crypto in Japan has been complex, with regulatory considerations and a more cautious approach from traditional financial institutions compared to some Western counterparts. However, Metaplanet’s actions suggest a growing confidence among some Japanese firms in integrating digital assets into their long-term financial planning. Increased institutional adoption in Japan could have several positive impacts: Increased Legitimacy: Corporate holdings lend credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Market Liquidity: Larger players entering the market can increase liquidity. Regulatory Clarity: As more companies engage with crypto, it can spur regulators to provide clearer guidelines. Investor Confidence: Seeing public companies allocate capital to BTC can boost confidence among retail and institutional investors alike. Metaplanet is effectively acting as an early adopter among Japanese listed companies, potentially encouraging others to explore similar strategies as they see the perceived benefits unfold. The Mechanics: How Does Issuing Bonds Fund Bitcoin Purchases? Let’s break down the mechanics of Metaplanet’s announcement. They are issuing 0% Ordinary Bonds. Bonds are essentially IOUs – Metaplanet is borrowing money from investors who buy these bonds. The ‘0%’ interest rate means Metaplanet doesn’t have to pay periodic interest payments to the bondholders; the return for investors typically comes from buying the bond at a discount to its face value or through other agreed-upon terms, though 0% bonds often imply repayment of the principal amount at maturity without interest accrual, making them attractive for the issuer in a low-rate environment. The capital raised from selling these bonds (approximately $21 million) will then be used by Metaplanet to purchase Bitcoin on the open market or through over-the-counter (OTC) desks. This directly links traditional finance mechanisms (bond issuance) to the acquisition of a digital asset ( BTC ). This method allows Metaplanet to increase its Bitcoin exposure without diluting existing shareholders through equity offerings, provided the returns on the BTC investment outweigh the obligations of the bond repayment at maturity. Challenges and Considerations for Metaplanet’s Strategy While the potential upsides are significant, Metaplanet’s strategy also comes with inherent challenges: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The most obvious risk is the potential for significant price drops in BTC , which could negatively impact the value of Metaplanet’s treasury holdings and potentially make it harder to repay the bond principal when due. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although Japan has a relatively developed crypto regulatory framework, changes could still impact the accounting treatment or holding requirements for digital assets. Public Perception: As a publicly listed company, Metaplanet is subject to scrutiny from investors and the public. Significant losses on their Bitcoin holdings could lead to negative sentiment. Operational Risks: Securely storing and managing significant amounts of BTC requires robust security protocols to prevent hacks or loss. Metaplanet must navigate these risks carefully. Their success will likely depend on the long-term performance of Bitcoin and their ability to manage market fluctuations and operational challenges. Actionable Insights for Investors Watching Japan and BTC Metaplanet’s move offers valuable insights for anyone interested in the intersection of traditional finance, cryptocurrencies, and the Asian market: Watch for More Japanese Companies: Metaplanet could be a bellwether. Keep an eye on other Japanese corporations and their potential interest in Bitcoin or other digital assets for treasury management or other purposes. Understand the ‘Bitcoin Company’ Model: Analyze companies that are explicitly adopting Bitcoin as a core part of their strategy. Their stock performance may become increasingly tied to the performance of BTC . Assess Financing Methods: Pay attention to how companies are financing their crypto acquisitions (debt, equity, cash flow). This reveals insights into their financial health and conviction levels. Monitor Regulatory Developments in Japan: Changes in Japanese regulations regarding crypto could significantly impact institutional adoption and the operational environment for companies like Metaplanet. Metaplanet’s $21 million bond issuance is more than just a single transaction; it’s a data point in the larger trend of institutional adoption and the evolving role of Bitcoin in corporate finance, particularly within the significant economy of Japan . In Conclusion: Metaplanet Forges Ahead with Bitcoin Metaplanet’s decision to issue $21 million in bonds specifically to acquire more Bitcoin is a powerful statement of conviction. It underscores the growing trend of publicly listed companies leveraging financial instruments to increase their exposure to the leading cryptocurrency, following a path blazed by others like MicroStrategy. This move is particularly significant coming from Japan , signaling potentially accelerating institutional adoption in a key Asian market. While challenges remain, primarily related to market volatility, Metaplanet’s strategy highlights the perceived long-term value and potential of BTC as a treasury asset. As they continue to execute this plan, their actions will be closely watched by investors and other corporations globally, potentially influencing the future landscape of corporate finance and digital asset integration.

With one Bitcoin costing over $100K, even 0.1 BTC costs around $10,770. That’s still a big chunk of money.

Matador Technologies, a technology company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange with a focus on Bitcoin, has successfully completed a significant funding round. This move is set to fuel strategic investments, including a key Bitcoin acquisition , and drive future business expansion. It underscores the continued flow of crypto funding into companies leveraging digital assets.

2025-05-29T11:52:45.000Z,"Bitcoin Enters Euphoria Phase: On-Chain Data Signals Volatility Ahead at $120K","Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a new phase of the bull cycle, hitting an all-time high (ATH) north of $111,000 on May 22, which was fueled by increased investor confidence, record spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, and heightened derivatives activity. However, as on-chain indicators flash signs of euphoric sentiment, analysts are warning that volatility could be around the corner, especially with the $120,000 level emerging as an important psychological and technical threshold. Rising Activity, Rising Caution According to the latest weekly market sweep by crypto analytics platform Glassnode, Bitcoin’s strength remains firmly intact. Metrics show rising investor profitability, soaring trade volume through centralized exchanges, and a 51% increase in futures open interest since April’s local low around the $74,000 level. The euphoric signals are also manifesting in tangible market activity. Glassnode reported a significant uptick in exchange interactions, with approximately 33% of all Bitcoin on-chain volume now flowing through centralized trading venues, something analysts consider to be a clear indicator of rising trading appetite. Furthermore, the analytics platform noted that while BTC has broken its third ATH this cycle, the rally remains within historical bounds. Its data paints a picture of a market heating up rapidly, with investor profitability surging high enough to push the Relative Unrealized Profit metric above its +2 standard deviation band. “These environments are usually characterized by heightened volatility and tend to be brief in duration,” noted analysts, highlighting that only 16% of all trading days see such extreme paper profits. Their finding is similar to a May 28 report from CryptoQuant, which revealed that 99% of Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are now in profit . This threshold marked critical market turning points in the past, often coming before either sustained rallies or sharp corrections. However, the experts at CryptoQuant urged caution, pointing to unresolved macroeconomic uncertainties , particularly around U.S. policy direction under the Trump administration, as a factor that could potentially mute full-blown risk appetite despite the extreme profitability. Price Action Reflects the Tension BTC’s recent price trajectory seems to be reflecting this push-and-pull dynamic. After peaking at $111,814 a week ago, the flagship cryptocurrency has experienced expected consolidation, pulling back to trade around $107,728 at the time of this writing. While the price represents a modest 1.2% dip in the last 24 hours, zooming out reveals the broader momentum. Despite a 3.4% pullback over the past seven days, BTC remains up by a solid 14.1% over the last month, while its year-over-year gains stand at 56.6%. All eyes are now fixed on the $120,000 threshold, which Glassnode identified as a critical inflection point at which several on-chain price models converge. Judging from the past, if BTC were to breach these levels, it could accelerate sell-side pressure as long-term holders look to pocket gains. “In the event of further upside, the $120k level appears as a key zone of interest, with sell-side pressure expected to accelerate,” the platform’s analysts concluded.

2025-05-29T11:52:11.000Z,"Hyperliquid pulls back after parabolic rally, retesting key support zone","Hyperliquid is cooling off after a parabolic rally, with price pulling back from recent highs as traders watch key support levels. Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) is trading at $34.25 at press time, down 5% over the past 24 hours. This follows a strong rally that saw the token climb 83% over the last 30 days, peaking at a new all-time high of $39.58 on May 26. Despite the dip, trading activity remains high. In the last 24 hours, trading volume rose to $325.7 million, a 12% increase in the past day. Derivatives activity has also been sustained, with a daily volume of $1.27 billion, up 8.33%, according to Coinglass data . Following the recent price peak, HYPE’s open interest dropped 4.45% to $1.29 billion, indicating that some traders might be taking profits or reducing leverage. The recent market move comes after Hyperliquid’s decentralized perpetuals platform saw a record spike in on-chain metrics. For the week ending May 26, the decentralized exchange recorded the highest weekly trading volume of $72 billion and an all-time high in open interest at $10.1 billion. Hyperliquid also surpassed major decentralized finance platforms like Berachain ( BERA ) in total value locked, reaching $3.5 billion, and now nears $1.5 trillion in cumulative trading volume less than two years after launch. You might also like: No VC, $1B Trades, and a 300% Rally — what makes Hyperliquid crypto tick? Part of the platform’s recent spotlight stems from visible high-leverage whale activity. Notably, pseudonymous trader James Wynn opened a $1.25 billion long position on Bitcoin ( BTC ) using 40x leverage between May 21–22. Initially, the trade netted in unrealized gains of $40 million, but by May 25, a market decline brought on by Trump’s tariff announcement resulted in losses ranging from $13.4 million to $17.5 million. Looking at the technical picture, HYPE appears to be in a healthy consolidation phase. After retreating from the upper Bollinger Band at $39, the token is currently testing the middle band, which is in line with short-term moving averages, around $33. Hyperliquid price analysis. Credit: crypto.news At 65.5, the relative strength index is showing positive momentum despite declining from overbought levels. The moving average convergence divergence is still bullish and indicates a sustained upward bias. All major moving averages, including the 10-day, 100-day, and SMAs, are in strong buy territory. The Stochastic RSI, on the other hand, is cooling, indicating that the rally may be losing steam. Bulls may view this as a buying opportunity if the token remains above the 20-day EMA at about $30.4. A drop below this could lead to a retest of lower levels near $28. On the upside, a break above $36 might pave the way for a second push toward $40 and higher highs.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Sherpa tells his 246,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is primed to rally if it overcomes a key psychological level. “Quite simple: if BTC breaks $110,000, we’re going to send pretty hard. Until then, altcoins probably just chop and slightly bleed down.” Source: AltcoinSherpa/X Bitcoin is trading at $108,819 at time of writing, a level that’s less than 3% below the all-time high price of just under $112,000 reached on May 22nd. The analyst also says Bitcoin’s price action over the coming few months will determine Ethereum’s trajectory. According to Sherpa, ETH could go up by around 50% over the coming months and about 280% in the long run. “The funny thing about this is that ETH probably still is going to go to $10,000 even with ETH/BTC being down only. Don’t know what happens in the short/mid-term but $4,000 should come within the next few months as long as Bitcoin holds up.” Source: AltcoinSherpa/X Ethereum is trading at $2,643 at time of writing. The widely followed analyst and trader also says Solana ( SOL ) appears bullish on the daily time frame, but its trajectory is dependent on Bitcoin’s price action. “Solana chart still looks pretty solid overall for a higher time frame swing.

2025-05-29T11:41:06.000Z,"Elon Musk Steps Down as Government Efficiency Czar After Short-Lived Tenure","Elon Musk has officially stepped down from his role as the White House’s government cost-cutting czar, ending a brief and contentious stint at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Confirming the news via a May 29 post on X, Musk thanked President Donald Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending” but admitted that improving federal operations proved to be an “uphill battle.” Musk’s position as a Special Government Employee limited his tenure to a maximum of 130 working days, which officially concludes on May 30. Appointed earlier this year, Musk took on the challenge of streamlining federal programs and reducing the size of the government workforce, but the results fell far short of his original ambition to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget. Musk Ambitious Targets According to Musk and DOGE, the department claims to have saved U.S. taxpayers around $175 billion since Trump’s return to office in January. However, multiple media outlets and independent audits have disputed these figures, citing errors and exaggerations. Even by Musk’s own revised goal of $150 billion, the claimed savings still fall just short. The agency reportedly eliminated approximately 260,000 federal positions — about 12% of the total 2.3 million workforce — through layoffs, buyouts, and early retirements . These moves drew backlash from labor unions and public sector advocates. A federal lawsuit filed by 14 states accuses DOGE of overstepping legal boundaries, including unauthorized access to data and the unlawful termination of federal employees. Musk also criticized a recent multi-trillion-dollar tax break package passed by House Republicans, arguing that it undermines DOGE’s budget reduction efforts. “The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I expected,” he told The Washington Post , and acknowledged the difficulty of achieving meaningful reform within Washington. Balancing Government Work and Corporate Leadership In a separate interview with Ars Technica on May 28, Musk reflected on the time he devoted to political affairs, stating, “I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics.” Critics have pointed to the executive’s increasing political involvement as a factor in Tesla’s recent struggles, including an 80% drop in net income in Q1. Still, Musk maintains that his role in DOGE was overstated and that his focus is now shifting back to his companies. “It’s not like I left the companies,” he clarified. Following his earlier announcement to reduce political commitments, Tesla shares jumped over 5% in after-hours trading, signaling renewed investor confidence. Despite Tesla’s underwhelming financial performance in 2025, the company still holds 11,509 Bitcoin , worth approximately $1.24 billion. Tesla stock remains down 5.9% year-to-date, largely in line with broader tech market trends.

2025-05-29T11:35:30.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – May 29, 2025","The crypto market saw another small drop today, though the situation has improved compared to yesterday, with more coins in the green, as the market consolidates. Nearly half of the top 100 coins per market cap have increased over the past day. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 2%, currently standing at $3.55 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $122 billion. TLDR: Crypto market consolidates; BTC hovers around the $108,000 level; Short-term sell-offs are expected; Bitcoin’s robust performance is a “fascinating signal amidst relatively challenging market conditions”; US spot ETFs continue seeing significant inflows; The dip is a part of the historical pattern, but keep an eye on the surrounding events. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, four of the top 10 coins per market capitalization are down and four are up over the past day (not taking stablecoins into account). Bitcoin (BTC) has decreased by 0.9% to the price of $107,940. This is also down from the intraday high of $109.037. Ethereum (ETH) saw the highest increase in this category by far. While others are up less than 1% per coin, ETH appreciated 3.6% to $2,729. As for ten coins, they are all down by less than 1%. BTC’s and Solana (SOL)’s 0.9% falls are the highest. SOL now trades at $172. Of the top 100 coins, nearly half are green, more than double seen yesterday. The highest decrease is Fartcoin (FARTCOIN)’s 4.8% to $1.29. The highest gainer is SPX6900 (SPX) , followed by Toncoin (TON) . They’re up 14.3% and 11% to $1.13 and $3.31, respectively. Over the past 24, TON perpetual futures open interest jumped to $190 million, its highest level since February. Over the past 24h, $TON perpetual futures OI surged +33% from $143M to $190M – its highest level since Feb 18. Interestingly, OI stayed elevated even after the price pullback. Past spikes like this have often preceded corrections – worth watching closely: https://t.co/wXpcaQoKul pic.twitter.com/IwbflHdkwZ — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 The current market dip doesn’t seem alarming. Per various analysts, it’s following the previously established patterns, whereby rallies are followed by short-term downwards corrections and sell-offs. Overall, it’s currently consolidating. ‘The Broader Outlook Remarkably Uncertain’ “Strength in the Bitcoin market remains firm,” says the latest report by blockchain and market data intelligence platform Glassnode . The report notes that price discovery phases are historically often followed by brief sell-offs. Early profit-takers are exiting and de-risking at new highs. As the market re-enters a period of price discovery, the unrealized profit has surged. However, with the rise in profitability comes an increase in sell-side pressure. At the same time, when the price rises, “larger volumes of buy-side demand are required to absorb the distributed coins in order for the market to sustain upwards momentum,” Glassnode explains. Source: Glassnode Overall, BTC Bitcoin has followed the pattern so far. It hit an ATH, profit-takers seized the opportunity to exit, the price pulled back to $107,000 shortly after the initial breakout, then recovered and consolidated around the $108,000 level. “Bitcoin is outperforming most asset classes amidst an environment of challenging macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions, making the broader outlook remarkably uncertain. This robust performance is a truly fascinating signal amidst relatively challenging market conditions,” the report highlights. Is $BTC strength waning – or just heating up? In the latest Week On-Chain, we explore rising investor spending, #BTC volume flowing through exchanges, and surging derivatives activity. We also highlight $120K as the next key zone of interest. Learn why: https://t.co/S4doFto7uL pic.twitter.com/Qd86YbmVtC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 28, 2025 When the analysts compared the price performances of the current cycle to previous ones, they found “a surprising similarity in structure.” Glassnode argues that it’s “a remarkable feat” for BTC to track earlier cycles so closely when accounting for the significantly larger market capitalization today. “This suggests that the scale of demand for Bitcoin is keeping pace with the growth rate of the asset,” the report concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next As noted, BTC currently trades at $107,940. This is 3.5% lower than the all-time high of $111,814 hit a week ago. The coin has largely been trading around the $108,000 level over the last few hours. Notably, it broke one support level of $108,731. Should it go lower, we could see it breaking supports at the $107,000 and $105,000 levels as well. On the upside, we’re also looking to see if the coin will break through $109,600 again and push towards $112,000. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has decreased from 68 to 65 . Notably, this is also down from 76 seen last week. This is still the green territory and indicates positive market sentiment and increased risk-taking. Nonetheless, the decrease over the week is notable. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, on 28 May, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net inflow of $432.62 million , led by BlackRock’s $480.96 million. The total net inflow now reached $45.34 billion. US ETH spot ETFs saw $84.89 million in net inflows, significantly higher than yesterday. The cumulative inflow is now $2.88 billion. The flows haven’t turned negative despite the market decrease. This indicates continual and strong institutional support and adoption. Consequently, this support may fuel the market’s next leg up.

The crypto market has recorded another slight decrease today, though the situation has improved since yesterday. The stock market also saw a decrease, though the two don’t seem linked. The S&P 500 is down 0.56%, the Nasdaq-100 fell 0.45%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 0.58%. Donald Trump’s back-and-forth on trade policy has resulted in volatile trading in traditional markets over the past few months. Is this dip sustainable? Analysts seem to agree that the rally may continue after a brief pause. Though the crypto market remains supported by strong capitalization and investor interest, regulatory or macroeconomic changes may negatively affect it as well, pulling the prices downward.

That expensive, complicated BitLicense has kept many firms at arm’s length – some even fled the state because of it. But now, Mayor Eric Adams is shaking things up in a big way. At Bitcoin 2025, he called for the full repeal of the BitLicense and invited crypto companies to “come back home.” What’s behind this sudden surge of confidence from a city that many thought had written off crypto? And what exactly is this new Bitcoin Bond he mentioned? Let’s break down what Adams’ vision is. Why BitLicense Has Been a Major Roadblock Since 2015, the BitLicense has been the golden ticket for crypto firms wanting to operate in New York. But “golden” is a stretch. The cost to get started easily tops $100,000, and the hoops to jump through are anything but easy. Only 34 companies have secured this license, including heavy hitters like Coinbase and Robinhood Crypto. For many, though, the price and red tape were too much. Some businesses, like BitQuick, left the state altogether, blaming “fee and compliance costs” for making New York more trouble than it’s worth. Adams: The “Bitcoin Mayor” Mayor Adams has been called the “Bitcoin mayor” for a reason – in 2022, he converted his first mayoral paycheck into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, he’s pushing harder, saying, “New York is the Empire State. We don’t break empires. We build empires.” He wants to scrap the BitLicense and open the doors wide for the “free flow of Bitcoin in our city.” That’s a clear challenge to the status quo. What’s This New York City Bitcoin Bond? Alongside the BitLicense repeal, Adams hinted at a fresh idea: a New York City Bitcoin Bond. The details are vague, but it could mean a municipal bond backed by Bitcoin – potentially giving everyday New Yorkers tax-exempt access to Bitcoin gains. It’s a smart move if it pans out, blending traditional finance with the crypto world in a way New York hasn’t seen before. Could This Be NYC’s Crypto Comeback Moment? If Adams pulls this off, New York could stop being a no-go zone for crypto startups. It might even spark a new wave of deregulation in other states hungry to attract digital asset firms. But the big question remains: Will the state government actually repeal the BitLicense? Or will this remain a dream, leaving crypto companies excluded?",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/mayor-eric-adams-demands-bitlicense-scrap-as-nyc-attracts-crypto-firms-come-back-home/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T11:27:29.000Z,"Bitcoin Is Not 'Rat Poison', But The Solution","Summary Bitcoin has proven itself as a store of value, diversification tool, and monetary hedge, especially in today's macro environment. Recent price action shows Bitcoin outperforming stocks even amid higher yields, signaling a fundamental shift in its market behavior. With US debt at unsustainable levels, monetary inflation is likely, making Bitcoin an essential hedge against fiscal irresponsibility. I remain highly bullish and advise investors to accumulate Bitcoin as a long-term hold for protection and growth. Thesis Summary Crypto was referred to as “rat poison” by Warren Buffett years ago, a sentiment which was recently echoed by a JPMorgan ( JPM ) employee. The timing could not be more ironic, with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) breaking new all-time highs and outperforming stocks even in a regime of higher yields. Far from rat poison, Bitcoin has provided investors with much-needed diversification from US financial assets and US currency exposure. Bitcoin, especially in the last few months, has proven itself as a monetary hedge, and with the macro regime we are facing, it’s never made more sense to own Bitcoin than today. I continue to advise investors to accumulate Bitcoin as a long-term hold. Interesting Timing Last week, President Trump was quoted on Twitter saying that the US is leading China in crypto. As a response to this, a former JPM employee, Marko Kolanovic , echoed Buffett's infamous words and tweeted that we are leading China in distributing rat poison . Curiously enough, less than a week later, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon announced the bank would be facilitating Bitcoin buying for its clients. While there are certainly some arguments to be made against the broader crypto space, I think we are well past the point of calling Bitcoin itself rat poison. Since its launch over 10 years ago, Bitcoin has proven itself as a store of value, a valuable diversification tool, and more recently, an actual hedge against monetary inflation and fiscal irresponsibility. What is Bitcoin? As an asset that is costly to create and has a limited supply, it is a store of value. (Not to be confused with price). A Bitcoin has some intrinsic value, and this will never be eroded through big changes in the supply. But where does Bitcoin demand come from? A few years ago, it was a niche subsector of the population: anarchists, libertarians, gold bugs, and tech enthusiasts. Then it became retail investors, who started to buy through exchanges. Shortly after, companies joined the game, followed by financial institutions and even sovereign nations. Does over 10 years of this trend not validate the demand side of the equation? Liquidity Barometer As a more “speculative” asset, Bitcoin’s prices have fluctuated with changes in global liquidity. Bitcoin/Liquidity (X) Global liquidity can be broadly understood as the amount of currency chasing assets around the world. More currency generally translates into higher asset prices, although not necessarily inflation. This is why stocks saw a big rise after COVID and also why Bitcoin rallied. Bitcoin: Now More Than Ever However, something even more interesting has happened in the last few months. Firstly, Bitcoin has outperformed other “risk assets” in the last six months. Even through geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin is making new highs while the SPX hasn’t yet. BTC vs SPX (TradingView) More importantly, Bitcoin has managed to rise in what we could even call a context of tightening liquidity/financial conditions, as measured by the 10-year yield in US Treasuries. BTC vs Yields (TradingView) Traditionally, the formula was yields down, Bitcoin up. However, in the last six months, we have seen yields up and Bitcoin up. This could suggest there is a fundamental shift in the Bitcoin market, which may be moving much more in line with, for example, gold, another monetary hedge. Trump Has Already Failed Therefore, we can highlight two very important developments in Bitcoin over the last three months. Bitcoin is outperforming traditional assets and moving higher with yields. It has become a hedge. Bitcoin and other assets are signalling that Trump has already failed in his policies. While President Trump came in with seemingly good intentions, a lot of his actions have fallen short of expectations. Tariffs have not been implemented yet. DOGE has barely made a dent in the budget. With aggressive tax cuts planned, the budget deficit could further increase in the next decade. In short, the \""status quo\"" looks ready to remain in place, with higher spending, and the US dollar continuing to hold its place as a reserve currency. This is going to require a much weaker dollar, something we have seen, and much higher inflation. Even the most \""radical\"" President in over two decades lacks either the will, support, or conviction to change things meaningfully. Bitcoin Is Inevitable Out of all the charts shown today, none is as important and explains what’s happening with Bitcoin as the one below. US Debt-GDP, Inflation, Yields (FRED) The US debt-to-GDP ratio is at wartime levels. It is definitely unsustainable, and the most likely outcome now is that we will reduce this debt burden through monetary inflation. This means money printing, yield curve control, and even possibly capital controls/financial repression. All things that happened in the 1960s and 1970s, and led to high inflation and high yields. However, it did successfully serve to bring down the debt-GDP levels. A win for the US government. A win for savvy investors. But a big loss for currency holders. The world is waking up to this reality again, but this time, the tools to hedge are much more widely available and accessible. Risks The real risk to Bitcoin would be a situation where the world actually makes a coordinated effort to reduce deficits through lower spending while simultaneously making some kind of return to hard money. By hard money, I mean a policy in which fiat currencies maintain a stable price in terms of gold. But even in this case, the hyper-financialised economic system we live in would have to be dialed back, and while Bitcoin would suffer, it could still prove more resilient than other financial assets. Beyond that, I'd argue the only other risk to Bitcoin is developments in quantum computing that could make Bitcoin vulnerable. As of writing this, I'd argue Bitcoin is even more secure than string gold in a vault, but this could actually change one day. Final Thoughts All in all, I remain very bullish on Bitcoin. It is perhaps one of the assets you can buy today with the highest conviction, in my opinion. Much more than a speculative risk asset, Bitcoin is now officially a hedge against fiscal irresponsibility and a debt crisis.

2025-05-29T11:21:42.000Z,"Dollar rallies, crypto unmoved as courts deal setbacks to Trump’s tariffs","Crypto markets stayed quiet on Thursday, even as the U.S. dollar pushed higher following a court ruling that temporarily blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping import tariffs on American trading partners. The decision, which came from a federal trade court, stated that Trump overstepped his legal authority in slapping across-the-board duties—throwing a wrench in the White House’s protectionist playbook. Trump’s team immediately filed an appeal , but the momentary pause in trade aggression gave the greenback enough oxygen to rally modestly across the board, including gains against the yen and the Swiss franc. According to data from Reuters , the dollar rose 0.34% against both currencies and briefly hit a two-week high of 146.29 yen before easing slightly. It also moved up against the euro, now trading near $1.1276, while sterling weakened to around $1.3467. Source: TradingView All these brought the U.S. dollar index—which tracks the dollar against six major currencies—back above 100 for the first time in a week. Still, it’s down 8% year-to-date, and most analysts aren’t sold on the idea of a sustained rally, warning that a lengthy legal battle over tariffs could keep the market jittery. Trump’s tariff loss boosts dollar and other currencies The Trump administration’s trade unpredictability has been a consistent drag on U.S. assets this year, as investors grow more cautious about high government debt and inconsistent economic direction. That change in risk appetite is showing up in Asian markets. As Trump’s trade tensions with China start to ease, investors are beginning to pull funds from U.S. assets and stack positions in Asian currencies. A new Reuters poll showed rising bullish sentiment for the yuan, Taiwanese dollar, and Philippine peso, all hitting levels not seen since late 2020. The Chinese yuan, which is now at its highest long position since October 2024, climbed 1% this month, partly due to revived trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Meanwhile, leaders across Southeast Asia have agreed that any bilateral trade agreements with the U.S. should not damage other member economies, a clear sign that Asia’s collective pushback to Trump’s tactics is gaining traction. The Taiwanese dollar, for example, has already surged more than 6% in May, logging its strongest monthly performance ever. Taiwan’s president dismissed talk of any currency agreement with Washington, pushing back on rumors that spiked the dollar on speculation that Trump was influencing its value. Bitcoin holds steady despite volatility in global markets While fiat currencies were shuffling positions, crypto assets like Bitcoin barely moved. Bitcoin is currently holding around $108,500, after briefly climbing above $112,000 a week ago. Despite muted price action, wallet addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have quietly accumulated 122,330 BTC over the past six weeks. This accumulation pattern , despite volatile macroeconomic conditions, suggests that larger holders are positioning for a longer-term bullish move, even as short-term price remains in check. Source: Glassnode The Bitcoin price cycle is showing a peculiar resemblance to previous cycles, despite the crypto market’s now massive scale. From the 2015–2018 cycle’s 1076% gain, to the 2018–2022 cycle’s 1007% rise, and now the 2022+ cycle’s 656% surge, the structure remains shockingly similar. That says a lot about the underlying demand for Bitcoin , even with its much larger market cap today. Profitability across the market is also changing. As Bitcoin climbed toward its previous all-time high, the Relative Unrealized Profit metric broke above its +2σ band. Historically, this level means euphoria is rising, often signaling heightened volatility and short-lived runs. Only 16% of trading days in Bitcoin’s history have seen paper profits this high. That’s showing up in realized profits, too. The Volatility-Adjusted Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, which normalizes gains and losses relative to Bitcoin’s size and market volatility, has increased. Source: Glassnode So far, 14.4% of trading days have seen larger realized profits, which means more investors are starting to cash out, but it’s not yet at panic levels. Meanwhile, the derivatives market is heating up. Open interest in futures contracts has jumped from $36.8 billion in April to $55.6 billion today, up 51% in 49 days. That kind of growth indicates a rising level of leverage in the system. Even more aggressive has been the rise in options contracts, which ballooned from $20.4 billion to a new all-time high of $46.2 billion. That’s a $25.8 billion increase, far outpacing the futures market.

The positive sentiment was buoyed by AI giant Nvidia's upbeat earnings . On-chain data showed large wallets, those holding over 10,000 BTC, have shifted to selling from buying as the largest cryptocurrency holds close to its record high, with an increase in exchange deposits also pointing to selling pressure. Meanwhile, options market data signaled potential for volatility ahead of Friday's monthly settlement. Ether ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, jumped to $2,780, the highest since Feb. 24, consistent with the bullish signals from the derivatives market. The token has been bid this week, supposedly on SharpLink's $425 million Treasury plan. Notably, U.S.-listed spot ether ETFs saw a net inflow of $84.89 million on Wednesday, extending their streak to eight consecutive days. Canada-listed investment firm Sol Strategies said it filed a preliminary prospectus with local securities regulators to raise up to $1 billion to boost its investment in the Solana ecosystem. Still, SOL was flattish at around $170. In the broader market, TON, PEPE and FLOKI led other coins higher while FARTCOIN, PI and JUP nursed most losses. Open interest in TON perpetual futures surged 33% to $190 million, clocking the highest since Feb. 18.

2025-05-29T11:11:54.000Z,"Has Bitcoin Peaked? BlackRock BTC Spot ETF Traders Lose Appetite for Upside","Bitcoin BTC has mostly traded sideways since printing record highs above $110,000 last week. The loss of upward momentum is now accompanied by signs waning bullish sentiment among market participants trading options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). That's evident from the one-year put-call skew, which reflects how the market prices in volatility risk for put options, offering downside protection relative to calls, representing bullish bets. Negative values represent a bullish bias while positive values suggest fears of downside. IBIT's one-year skew has bounced to nearly zero from the four-month low of minus 3.8 two weeks ago, according to data source Market Chameleon .

2025-05-29T12:38:54.000Z,"No more ETH dumps? Ethereum Foundation turns to DeFi for cash","The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has borrowed $2 million in GHO, a decentralized stablecoin developed by Aave, in a move signaling deeper engagement with decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.  In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards. The community member also floated the idea of using Aave to borrow stablecoins against its holdings. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-foundation-borrows-gho-defi-strategy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

We’re re-architecting everything,” said Donut founder and CEO Chris Zhu. “We’re reconstructing the front end of the internet to be hyper-financialized for AI agents.”  Donut closes $7 million pre-seed round. Source: DonutRelated: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin ‘premium’ nears $600K per BTCDonut’s users will gain access to an array of decentralized tools and crypto services under a single agentic interface, which could make digital asset transactions safer.“Architecturally isolated signing environments and AI-powered risk screening secure every transaction while optimizing execution for speed and cost,” said Zhu, adding that “AI translates opaque calldata into plain English and assigns safety grades.”Donut’s AI agents can trade or swap tokens, place bets, or earn passive yield on digital assets.Related: Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoptionAgentic browsers could reshape internet in next decadeWhile Donut’s earliest adopters will likely be crypto traders, builders or decentralized finance (DeFi) users, agentic browsers may explode into the mainstream during the next decade.Within the next five years, Ethereum layer-2 (L2) networks will use agentic browsers to cut settlement costs. Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

SOL/ETH weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April. Daily fees peaked in Q1 2025 but have since fallen to near-yearly lows, signaling reduced speculative activity on the chain, according to Dune Analytics.Pump.Fun fee and revenue chart.

You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said.“I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.”New York City Mayor Eric Adams wants a Bitcoin bond and to axe the State BitLicense program. BitSource: YouTubeAdams didn’t share details about how a Bitbond would work; however, a March 31 policy brief paper from advocacy group the Bitcoin Policy Institute proposed a model where holders receive an annual interest rate of 1% for 10 years.When the bond matures, holders also receive a percentage of any Bitcoin market gains. At the same time, 90% of the funds raised through the bonds are allocated to government spending, while 10% is used to purchase Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s bond policy brief.Adams again pushes to axe BitLicenseAdams also called for repealing New York’s BitLicense program, which the state launched in 2015 ﻿and requires crypto businesses to apply for a license with the New York Department of Financial Services and meet strict compliance standards.The BitLicense program has received criticism from the industry, and Adams has also said the measure is too costly with high licensing fees, and is too stringent with its Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures. “You have a mayor who is the crypto mayor, is the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the city of New York, where you won’t be attacked and criminalized,” he said.“Let’s get rid of the Bitcoin license and allow us to have the free flow of Bitcoin in our city.”Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summitUSDC stablecoin issuer Circle was one of the first crypto companies to receive a BitLicense; others have since followed, including crypto exchange Coinbase and trading firm Bakkt.Adams has been actively pushing to attract crypto firms to New York City.

Source: CoinMarketCapThe Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed.“It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.”On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers, levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10%.Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified.“The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, really — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said, “Buy everything round dos.”Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrowCrypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said, “So Trump tariffs are illegal?

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewOnce SOL price enters price discovery, bullish momentum could target the 1.618 extension, suggesting SOL could reach as high as $418.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

If the pattern plays out, the trader warned that SOL could revisit $157 to $152 in the short term.The $180 level remains the critical inflection point.

2025-05-28T22:20:00.000Z,"Ethereum bulls aim for $2.7K ahead of ETH’s $2.4B options expiry","Key takeaways:97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share. Ethereum no longer ranks among the top ten protocols in terms of fees, creating a supply imbalance that contributes to inflationary pressure on ETH.Sell (put) options ill-prepared for ETH prices above $2,600ETH options aggregate open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $2,300 and $2,500: $420 million in calls (buy) vs. $220 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $200 million.Between $2,500 and $2,600: $500 million calls vs. $130 million puts, favoring calls by $370 million.Between $2,600 and $2,700: $590 million calls vs. $35 million puts, favoring calls by $555 million.Between $2,700 and $2,900: $780 million calls vs. $10 million puts, favoring calls by $770 million.Bulls are strongly incentivized to push ETH past $2,700, yet the broader context may override those efforts. Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”“We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats,” said US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. The Labor Department under Biden criticized the practice of marketing cryptocurrencies to 401(k) participants. At the time, the agency claimed cryptocurrencies posed “significant risks and challenges” to participants’ retirement accounts due to their “speculative and volatile” nature and “valuation concerns,” among other reasons.The American Banking Association (ABA) criticized the 2022 compliance release, claiming that it did not make the guidance available for public comment and review prior to issuance.Related: Fidelity introduces retirement accounts with minimal-fee crypto investingTrump administration shifts crypto landscapePresident Trump has pledged to make the United States “the world capital of crypto” during his 2024 campaign.Under his administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has scaled back several enforcement actions and investigations involving Web3 companies such as Uniswap, Coinbase, and Kraken, while also engaging in policy discussions on topics like real-world asset tokenization and the regulatory status of certain tokens.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5.

This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved. And when in doubt, always verify before sending funds.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/elderly-crypto-investors-are-getting-scammed-teach-them-these-key-safety-tips?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

He added that he is confident many of those investors will cycle back into the crypto market to fuel the next big rally.2. Smart money agrees on Bitcoin’s year-end targetSeveral analysts have set $200,000 as their target for Bitcoin in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices.Kendrick said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins.Related: A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route“The US Senate… voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act,” Kendrick wrote in the email note. “The point of the stablecoin Act is that stablecoins will further legitimise the whole asset class.

2025-05-28T13:33:33.000Z,"UK FCA requests public comments on stablecoin, crypto custody regulation","The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has requested public feedback on proposed regulations for stablecoins and cryptocurrency custody.In a May 28 request for comment, the United Kingdom’s financial regulator announced that its regulatory proposals are “the latest milestone on the road to crypto regulation.” The draft rules are based on prior roundtables and industry feedback. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets. At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.”The FCA also noted it will work with the UK’s central bank to regulate stablecoins. Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said, “For those stablecoins that expect to operate at systemic scale, the Bank of England will publish a complementary consultation paper later this year.”Related: UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini reportEnsuring stablecoins remain stableThe FCA said that its rules “aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value.” The regulator said customers must be clearly informed about how the backing assets are managed. It also recommended that stablecoin issuers appoint independent third-party custodians to hold reserve assets:“We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency, irrespective of the value of the backing assets portfolio, with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.“Breeden added that the FCA’s proposals are part of a broader effort to build the UK’s stablecoin regime.Related: UK to require crypto firms to report every customer transactionCrypto custody rules incomingThe FCA’s proposals also introduce new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services, as outlined in a separate discussion paper.

It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT monthly sales.

In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

2025-05-28T09:59:06.000Z,"Fungible cryptos in secondary sales are not securities, Ripple tells SEC","Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP, argued that fungible cryptocurrencies are not securities when transferred in secondary transactions in a recent letter sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In its May 27 letter, Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
