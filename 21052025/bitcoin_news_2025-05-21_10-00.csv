2025-05-21T07:52:20.000Z,"Bitcoin Explosion To $500,000 Still On Track Amid Growing Sovereign BTC Exposure — Standard Chartered","Standard Chartered reiterates that the Bitcoin price is still on track to balloon to $500,000 before President Donald Trump leaves office. The British multinational bank said sovereign entities increased their indirect exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency in the first quarter by buying shares in Strategy (MSTR), noting that the trend bolsters its half-million BTC price projection. Increasing Allocations To MSTR Is Bullish For Bitcoin Roughly 12 government entities increased their exposure to MSTR in Q1, holding 31,000 Bitcoin worth of Strategy shares, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. Although investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were greenlighted in the U.S. in 2024, government entities’ increased Strategy holdings reflect “widening structural demand” for Bitcoin and Strategy’s continued use as a Bitcoin proxy, Kendrick explained. “We believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings,” he added. Government entities upped their MSTR holdings during the first quarter, with Norway’s Government Pension Fund, the Swiss National Bank, and South Korea’s pension and investment bodies each adding the equivalent of 700 BTC. Meanwhile, United States state retirement funds across California, New York, North Carolina, and Kentucky added a combined 1,000 BTC equivalent. Sweden and Liechtenstein made minor increases, while France and Saudi Arabia took first-time positions, albeit tiny, indicating growing sovereign interest in indirect BTC exposure, according to Kendrick. “The latest 13F data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports our core thesis that Bitcoin will reach the $500,000 level before Trump leaves office as it attracts a wider range of institutional buyers,” the banker opined. The latest first quarter 13F filings — reports that institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file each quarter — indicate that sovereigns’ exposure to Bitcoin via spot exchange-traded funds “was disappointing at first glance,” while increasing MSTR holdings were “very encouraging,” Standard Chartered said. The most notable ETF move came from the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which sold off its entire 3,400 BTC-equivalent stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Kendrick argued that these 13F filings are the best way to test “our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures,” pushing the price of the asset to the $500,000 milestone. “When institutions buy Bitcoin, prices tend to rise,” he summarized.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-explosion-to-500000-still-on-track-amid-growing-sovereign-btc-exposure-standard-chartered/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-05-21T07:47:03.000Z,"NYC Mayor Eric Adams announces establishment of a crypto advisory council","Mayor Eric Adams announced on May 20th that the city of New York was launching a crypto advisory council to bring fintech jobs into the Big Apple. He noted that NYC had sufficient experts to help New Yorkers navigate solutions through blockchain technology. Speaking at the first ever crypto summit hosted at the mayor’s official residence, Gracie Mansion, Adams asserted that NYC was “open for ‘crypto’ business” and the proposed digital assets council would be composed of industry individuals, with a chair to be confirmed in the coming weeks. Mayor Adams vows to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” We're taking the next step in becoming the Crypto Capitol of the WORLD, hosting our city's first-ever Crypto and Digital Assets Summit! Join us LIVE as we get started: https://t.co/iwO6ThkaSB — Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) May 20, 2025 Mayor Adams said at the crypto conference on Tuesday that he wanted to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” and will make policy recommendations in the coming weeks. He also pointed out that in addition to business interests, the city will explore putting birth and death records onto a blockchain to help New Yorkers’ next of kin easily access these types of documents. Adams told the inaugural NYC crypto summit on May 20 that the plan to establish the city’s crypto advisory council was not about chasing memes and trends. He added that the world is currently in the age of tokenization—which includes, blockchain, and other fintech innovations—and NYC was going to continue to move forward with it. “We want to use technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today … That means supporting the development of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive tech ecosystem. We must embrace this emerging technology and build on the success of our economy.” ~ Eric Adams, the Mayor of New York City The self-proclaimed “tech mayor” also revealed his history as a computer programmer, highlighting that he was one of the original architects of OLTPS, the precursor to COMPStat. He disclosed that he came into the tech world with a real mindset that technology could improve the lives of people, and the establishment of the crypto advisory council was part of “the evolution of that improvement.” NYC Mayor asks crypto companies to set up shop in the Empire State Mayor Adams made a pitch to crypto companies returning to the U.S. or expanding their presence in the country to set up shop in New York City. He said at a previous press briefing at Gracie Mansion that the city of New York should be looking forward to building crypto empires. Adams, who is running for reelection, reiterated his commitment to making NYC a crypto hub, telling reporters that he would work with tech and crypto companies—both big and small—to create a friendly environment to attract and help them succeed. He added that his goal remained the same as it was on day one as mayor, helping President Trump make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” Adams also claimed that New York would attract world-class talent, provide opportunities for underbanked communities, and make the government more user-friendly. He pointed out that his office was focused on the long-term value of these technologies for the city and its people. In the past, Adams was critical of Bitlicense, claiming that it stifled regulation, and he advocated scrapping it shortly after taking office as mayor in 2022. He, however, seemed to strike a more conciliatory tone towards NYDFS, saying that it was good to know that the city would have safe regulations in place for those who were investing and that there would not be any abuses.

2025-05-21T07:46:11.000Z,"Theta Capital bags $175m to back Coinfund, Polychain and other crypto VCs","Dutch investment firm Theta Capital closed a $175 million raise to back crypto-specialist VCs through its latest fund-of-funds. Theta Capital Management has pulled in over $175 million for a new fund-of-funds designed to help institutional investors get exposure to early-stage blockchain startups by backing some of the industry’s top crypto venture firms. The new fund, dubbed Theta Blockchain Ventures IV, will invest in venture capital firms that specialize in crypto, Bloomberg has learned , referring to Ruud Smets, the company’s managing partner and chief investment officer. Founded in 2001, the Netherlands-based firm began focusing on cryptocurrencies in 2018 and now manages around $1.2 billion in assets. Theta has previously backed firms like Coinfund, Polychain Capital, and Castle Island Ventures. It’s still unclear though how Theta plans to allocate the newly raised capital.

According to a May 14 report by PitchBook, VC deal value in Q1 rose to $6 billion, more than double the $2.6 billion seen a year ago. However, the number of deals fell to 405 from 670 over the same period. PitchBook’s senior crypto analyst Robert Le said the $1.4 billion Bybit theft , which he described as the first and only “10-digit hack in history,” served as a stark reminder of the operational risks still present in the industry. He suggested the incident could drive greater institutional demand for real-time proof-of-reserve tools, improved custody systems, and middleware that simplifies key management. Le also said startups working on these areas might find a more favorable funding environment, even amid a broader reset in valuations. Despite Bitcoin hitting a record high of $100,000 in Q4 2024, venture capital activity in crypto startups remained flat , with VC deal size down nearly 90% since 2018.

2025-05-21T07:46:02.000Z,"Bitfinex Alpha | Sức Mua Thực Tế Đẩy Bitcoin Lên Đỉnh Mới","XEM FULL BÁO CÁO Tạo Tài kHoản Bitfinex Bitcoin tiếp tục thể hiện sự bền bỉ đáng kinh ngạc và sức mạnh cấu trúc bất khả chiến bại, tăng đều đặn kể từ khi lấy lại mức đáy $92,000 vào cuối tháng Tư. Cú tăng giá gần đây mang đậm dấu ấn của thị trường spot , với những pha bứt phá mạnh mẽ sau những giai đoạn ngắn gọn và rõ ràng để nghỉ xả hơi. Điều này cho thấy việc tích lũy diễn ra lành mạnh và nhu cầu tiềm ẩn rất vững chắc, thay vì bị thúc đẩy bởi các yếu tố đầu cơ thái quá. Dữ liệu Khối lượng Delta tích lũy (CVD) trên các sàn lớn vẫn giữ mức dương, khẳng định rằng những người mua thực sự — chứ không phải dân đánh đòn bẩy — đang chiếm ưu thế trong cuộc đua này. Trong khi đó, thị trường phái sinh đang ở trạng thái phản ứng , với các biến động về khối lượng mở (OI) cho thấy giai đoạn chuyển đổi, nơi các cú ép bán và thanh lý hàng loạt giúp làm sạch lớp bọt bẩn trên thị trường. Kết quả là nền tảng hiện tại trở nên sạch sẽ hơn, với đà tăng được hỗ trợ bởi dòng vốn thực chất thay vì những cơn sốt nhất thời. Với giá Bitcoin vừa điều chỉnh nhẹ sau khi đạt mức cao kỷ lục, mức chênh lệch giá (premium) thị trường giao ngay vẫn khá cao, hành động giá đi ngang hiện tại có thể chỉ đơn giản là một khoảng thời gian lấy sức trước khi bùng nổ. Mặc dù các đợt điều chỉnh nhỏ vẫn có khả năng xảy ra, xu hướng lớn vẫn đang nghiêng về phía tích cực. Mặc dù Bitcoin đang bay cao, nhưng các dấu hiệu cảnh báo tiếp tục xuất hiện trên nền kinh tế Mỹ, khi lạm phát giảm dần nhưng những rủi ro cấu trúc sâu hơn bắt đầu lộ rõ. Chỉ số giá tiêu dùng (Consumer Price Index – CPI) chỉ tăng 0.2% so với tháng trước và tăng 2.3% so với năm ngoái—mức tăng thấp nhất kể từ đầu 2021. Giá thực phẩm giảm đã giúp làm dịu bớt áp lực từ chi phí nhà ở, nhưng triển vọng vẫn còn mờ mịt do bất ổn quanh thuế quan và chính sách thương mại. Dù Mỹ và Trung Quốc đã đạt được thỏa thuận ngừng bắn tạm thời, các mức thuế nhập khẩu lớn vẫn đang tồn tại, và nhiều khả năng sẽ có thêm thuế mới vào tháng 7 tới. Những căng thẳng thương mại chưa được giải quyết này tạo ra thách thức lớn cho cả doanh nghiệp và giới hoạch định chính sách. Đồng thời, áp lực tài chính đang đè nặng lên các hộ gia đình. Số liệu từ Fed New York cho thấy tỷ lệ nợ tín dụng và vay sinh viên quá hạn trên 90 ngày đang tăng lên, vẽ nên bức tranh u ám về tình hình tài chính cá nhân. Khi tác động của thuế quan bắt đầu cắn, cùng với rủi ro lạm phát tiếp tục treo lơ lửng, sự kết hợp giữa tăng trưởng chậm và giá cả leo thang—hay còn gọi là lạm phát đình trệ (stagflation) —có thể khiến Cục Dự trữ Liên bang (Fed) rơi vào thế khó. Hiện tại, với chi phí dịch vụ lõi và nhà ở vẫn còn ở mức cao, Fed nhiều khả năng sẽ tiếp tục thận trọng. Tuy nhiên, khi áp lực kinh tế ngày càng gia tăng, những tháng tới sẽ đòi hỏi sự linh hoạt và cảnh giác cao độ. Dù thị trường có lúc chập chờn và quy định pháp lý vẫn là câu chuyện dài kỳ, việc chấp nhận Bitcoin trong giới doanh nghiệp và tổ chức vẫn đang phát triển mạnh mẽ. Quỹ đầu tư Mubadala của Abu Dhabi đã tăng cường nắm giữ cổ phần trong quỹ ETF Bitcoin spot của BlackRock (IBIT) trong quý 1/2025, thể hiện niềm tin dài hạn mặc cho giá trị thị trường của IBIT tạm thời sụt giảm. Kể từ khi ra mắt vào tháng 1/2024, IBIT đã dẫn đầu thị trường ETF spot tại Mỹ, thu hút hơn $45.5 tỷ dòng tiền chảy vào và quản lý tổng cộng $65.4 tỷ tài sản. Tại Mỹ Latinh, công ty fintech Méliuz của Brazil đã trở thành công ty đại chúng đầu tiên trong khu vực áp dụng chiến lược dự trữ Bitcoin. Sau khi mua 274.52 BTC trị giá $28.4 triệu , tổng số Bitcoin họ sở hữu giờ đã vượt 320 BTC . Động thái này nhận được sự ủng hộ mạnh mẽ từ cổ đông và khiến giá cổ phiếu công ty tăng vọt 116% , minh chứng cho sự ủng hộ của nhà đầu tư đối với chiến lược tài chính dựa trên crypto. Tuy nhiên, khung pháp lý vẫn là một trận chiến cam go. Một thẩm phán Mỹ vừa bác bỏ đề nghị chung giữa SEC (Ủy ban Chứng khoán và Giao dịch) và Ripple nhằm giảm nhẹ hình phạt và dỡ bỏ các hạn chế, viện dẫn lỗi thủ tục do vụ án đang trong quá trình kháng cáo. Quyết định này tạm thời chặn đứng một thỏa thuận tiềm năng trong vụ kiện mang tính bước ngoặt, có thể định hình tương lai của quy định crypto tại Mỹ. Tất cả những sự kiện này phản ánh cả động lực lẫn thách thức mà crypto đang đối mặt trong hành trình tiến vào hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu.

2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses. What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user. But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience. Did you know? According to a recent survey , 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step. Common crypto transfer mistakes A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes. Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes: Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet. Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt ( USDT ) over Ethereum instead of Tron ? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network. Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely. Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify. Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network. Failed crypto transaction explained Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes. A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees . If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days. Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum , where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning. Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures. Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed. If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first: Confirm the recipient’s address is correct. Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum , BNB Smart Chain (BSC) , Polygon , etc.). Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana). Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending . Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent. If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee . What to check before sending crypto Prevention is your best friend. Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending. Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform. Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help. Crypto transfer speed and networks Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time. Chains like Solana , Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem. That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin ( BTC )? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana ? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress. How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions. The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges. Other problems arise from the “ sunrise issue ,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers. Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse. How to avoid failed crypto transactions Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing. Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask ) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds. Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees. How to verify a crypto transfer Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed. Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details. Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move. Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind. As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed. The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it. Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|SOL|BNB","crypto transfers",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T07:34:10.000Z,"Bitcoin to Skyrocket to $600K as S&P 500 Crashes 50%, Says Analyst","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to flirt with its all-time high, one analyst has laid out an interesting scenario in which the cryptocurrency skyrockets to $600,000 within 90 days while the S&P 500 collapses by 50%. Prominent market commentator Fred Krueger detailed his prediction in a 10-part thread on X posted on May 20, painting a hyperbullish picture for BTC powered by monetary instability, institutional Bitcoin adoption, and a full-scale flight from traditional markets. A Doomsday Scenario for Traditional Markets Krueger is basing his thesis on a catastrophic breakdown in U.S. financial stability, beginning with a failed $200 billion Treasury auction in late July 2025. According to his projection, weak demand for U.S. debt will potentially force the Federal Reserve into emergency interventions, sparking a crisis of confidence in the dollar. Within weeks, BRICS nations, led by economic heavyweights China and Russia, will announce a gold-backed global payment system, speeding up the decline of USD dominance and pushing BTC to $180,000. By August, the investor claims the situation will escalate dramatically, with a major U.S. pension fund possibly halting redemptions, which will force the Fed to impose yield cap control that should cap Treasury rates at 6.5% while the dollar goes into freefall. Meanwhile, countries such as Nigeria, Turkey, and Venezuela will ostensibly start shifting foreign reserves into Bitcoin, pushing its price to $265,000, with gold potentially rallying to the $6,700 level. The most explosive phase in the $600,000 timeline will arrive in September, when Krueger predicts several U.S. tech titans, including Apple, Tesla, and Google, will reveal huge BTC holdings, with the iPhone maker allegedly accumulating as much as 200,000 BTC since April. At this juncture, he postulates that the cryptocurrency’s price will have reached $460,000. Additionally, the expert speculates that the IMF will make a historic move, announcing a new global reserve basket with Bitcoin making up half of it, gold covering 30%, and the remaining 20% taken up by other assets. By early October, Krueger claims the U.S. government will be forced to convene an emergency “New Bretton Woods” summit, where it will restructure the dollar to be partially backed by BTC and gold. It is in this macro-maelstrom that he sees the king cryptocurrency hitting $600,000, gold reaching $10,400, and the S&P 500 losing half its value. Strong Fundamentals While Krueger’s roadmap reads like financial fiction, Bitcoin has shown some of the resilience and bullish momentum he’s basing his prediction on. At the time of writing, the asset was trading at $107,000, up a slight 1% in 24 hours, which has put it just 1.3% away from rediscovering its all-time high. On a monthly basis, BTC is up 23.1%, and year-over-year, it has surged 51.6%. Much of this strength comes from steady institutional demand and constrained supply. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have recorded eight days of positive flows out of the last ten, with total inflows topping $3.3 billion since the beginning of May, according to Farside Investors. This comes as heavyweights like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet announced additional BTC purchases, totaling nearly $850 million.

The asset manager has added Bitcoin ETFs and crypto ATM shares. BlackRock’s IBIT leads U.S. Bitcoin ETFs in inflows. Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, has made its first move into crypto markets, purchasing shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a May 20 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares as of March 31, valued at approximately $1.08 million. The investment was added to the firm’s $2.63 billion Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), marking the asset manager’s initial exposure to Bitcoin via regulated financial products. Blackstone Adds ProShares Bitcoin ETF and Crypto ATM Shares to Portfolio The filing also reveals that Blackstone purchased 9,889 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), totaling $181,166, and a smaller position in Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM), a crypto ATM operator, with 4,300 shares worth just $6,300. Though modest in size—especially relative to Blackstone’s $1.2 trillion in assets under management—the move represents a notable shift for a firm that has historically kept crypto at arm’s length. In 2019, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman expressed skepticism about crypto, stating, “I was raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,” and admitted difficulty understanding the technology behind it. Blackstone’s entry into Bitcoin ETFs comes as demand for institutional access to digital assets grows. $1 TRILLION BLACKSTONE JUST REVEALED BUYING #BITCOIN ETF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THIS IS WILD!!! pic.twitter.com/PvlIddtndp — Vivek (@Vivek4real_) May 20, 2025 IBIT, launched by BlackRock in January 2024, has quickly become the leader among U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. As of mid-May, the fund has recorded over $46.1 billion in net inflows and has not seen a single outflow since April 9, according to Farside Investors. In contrast, the Wisconsin Investment Board, one of the first U.S. public pension funds to gain Bitcoin exposure, reported on May 15 that it had fully liquidated its 6 million IBIT shares during Q1. IBIT continues to outpace competitors like Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK’s Bitcoin ETF, which have seen $11.8 billion and $2.8 billion in net inflows, respectively. DigiAsia Stock Doubles on $100M Bitcoin Purchase Plan Shares of Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp surged by over 91% on May 19 , after the Nasdaq-listed company announced plans to raise $100 million to initiate Bitcoin purchases as part of a new treasury strategy. The Jakarta-based firm revealed that its board has approved the creation of a Bitcoin treasury reserve. DigiAsia says it intends to allocate up to 50% of its net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how it plans to manage its capital amid growing corporate interest in digital assets. In addition to deploying profits into Bitcoin, DigiAsia is actively exploring a capital raise of up to $100 million to kickstart its holdings. Notably, public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, leading the charge. The Virginia-based company recently announced it would double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion in order to acquire more Bitcoin.

The company’s stock has surged over 4,800% over the past year because of the company’s pivot to Bitcoin investment strategy. Originally a budget hotel operator, Metaplanet turned to Bitcoin-first treasury strategy in 2024 and has since seen a significant rise in its stock prices. As of today, the company holds 7,800 BTC, worth over $800 million after its latest purchase of 1004 BTC two days ago . Apparently Metaplanet is the most shorted stock in Japan. Do they really think betting against Bitcoin is a winning strategy? pic.twitter.com/SAKsOMO4MX — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) May 21, 2025 A Setup for Global Short Squeeze? Despite a meteoric rise in Metaplanet’s stock, many investors have questioned the sustainability of Metaplanet’s valuation, leading to a sharp increase in short interest by hedge fund managers in the Japanese market. Short sellers, betting the stock will fall, are now under pressure as the company’s shares hit upper daily price limits and trading halts were triggered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for two consecutive days. With the TSE temporarily restricting access, short sellers have turned to OTC trading in international markets to cover their positions. However, these exchanges offer significantly lower liquidity, forcing traders to compete for a limited supply of shares, often at prices above their original short-sale levels. This dynamic has led to mounting speculation of a global short squeeze in the making, sentiments echoed by Bitcoin bull and Tesmanian founder Vincent Yu in a post on X . He added: “This could be a really huge Metaplanet short squeeze. Short sellers are now needed to buy back in the lowest liquidity market $MTPLF & DN3 which will push up the price higher and faster, that cause more halted in Japan.” “Really Bad Timing to be Short”: Blockstream CEO Hashcash inventor Blockstream CEO Adam Back also posted on X replying to Metaplanet’s CEO saying that in his opinion the stock is still relatively cheap based on historic mNAV ranges, and on months to cover metric. “Shorting it seems like a really bad idea to me! This is the second 3350:TYO circuit-breaker limit-up day in a row, really bad timing to be short.” In related news, Bitcoin soared past $107,700 earlier this morning during Asia trading hours, just 1% shy from its all-time high of $108,786.

He noted that birth certificates and death records could remain private while remaining easily accessible to families. Fraser pointed to financial inclusion as another priority. He suggested that future pilot programs might allow residents without bank accounts to pay for city services with crypto. “We’re not talking about innovation. We’re talking about survival,” he said, warning that the city risks falling behind without a clear strategy. Pushing Crypto into Everyday City Services for New York Adams, who compares himself to Star Trek’s Captain Kirk as he explores new frontiers, said he’s on the lookout for his own “Spock” and other visionaries to join the council. He repeatedly pointed to his commitment to integrating crypto and blockchain into everyday municipal operations. After his remarks, attendees broke into facilitated tables. There, they brainstormed opportunities and obstacles. The top ideas are slated for formal endorsement from the mayor’s office. Further, he reassured the industry that its perseverance had paid off. “You were harassed, you were demonized. You were treated as though you were the enemy,” he said, “But you withstood it. Your resiliency is admirable, and it will all pay off, because everyone is going to come around.” Adams earned the nickname “Bitcoin Mayor” in 2022 when he converted his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum. This gesture followed a friendly challenge from Miami’s mayor. Since then, his early embrace of digital assets has made him one of the most prominent US politicians to back crypto publicly. Consequently, it has reinforced New York’s bid to lead in the sector.

2025-05-21T07:09:02.000Z,"Theta Capital raises $175M to back early-stage blockchain startups","Amsterdam-based Theta Capital Management raised over $175 million for its latest fund-of-funds, aimed at supporting early-stage blockchain startups through specialized venture capital (VC) firms. The new vehicle, Theta Blockchain Ventures IV, will channel capital into crypto-native VC firms with a track record of backing blockchain innovation, Theta’s managing partner and chief investment officer Ruud Smets told Bloomberg. Smets said the strategy focuses on specialist managers who can outperform generalist investors in the earliest funding rounds. “We’ve always been looking for areas where specialization and active management provide a sustainable edge,” Smets noted. He said that the experience and positioning of dedicated crypto VCs “has compounded over time,” creating barriers for less focused investors trying to enter the space. Founded in 2001, Theta shifted its focus to digital assets in 2018 and now manages about $1.2 billion. The firm has backed leading crypto investment names such as Polychain Capital, CoinFund and Castle Island Ventures. Source: Theta Capital Related: AI takes nearly 60% of global venture capital dollars in Q1 Crypto VC deals rebound The fund’s close comes as crypto venture capital begins to rebound. According to Galaxy Digital, VC investment in digital assets rose 54% in the first quarter of 2025 to $4.8 billion, signaling renewed confidence in the sector after a prolonged downturn. A report from PitchBook also showed that crypto venture capital funding surged in early 2025, even as deal activity declined. The report showed that 405 VC deals were completed in Q1 2025, a 39.5% drop from the 670 recorded in the same period last year. However, that’s a modest uptick from the 372 deals seen in Q4 2024. Despite fewer deals, total funding more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $6 billion in Q1 compared to $2.6 billion in Q1 2024, also doubling from the previous quarter’s $3 billion. PitchBook’s senior crypto analyst Robert Le noted that even amid macroeconomic uncertainty, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.” The bulk of the investment — around $2.55 billion across just 16 deals — went to companies in asset management, trading platforms and crypto financial services. Infrastructure and development firms followed, raising nearly $955 million across 30 deals. Web3-focused companies saw the third-most deals and funding, at 23 and $231.2 million, respectively.

With $1.18 billion in VC funding raised so far, PitchBook estimates a 64% chance that Circle will ultimately go public.

In a JPMorgan webcast posted by Bloomberg Television, Dimon says investors seem to be operating under a false sense of security following the S&P 500’s sharp 23% rebound over the past few weeks. According to Dimon, investors seem oblivious to the adverse effects of Trump’s tariffs, which he warns could reignite inflation, trigger stagflation and fuel growing anti-American sentiment overseas. “My own view, you know, people feel pretty good because you haven’t seen an effect of tariffs. The market came down 10%, it’s back up 10%. I think that’s an extraordinary amount of complacency. That’s my own view that when I’ve seen all these things adding up that are on the fringes of an extreme kind of thing, I don’t think we could predict the outcome. And I think the chance of inflation going up and stagflation will be higher than other people think. There are too many things out there, and I think you can see the effect. Even if these low levels stay where they are today, that’s pretty extreme tariffs. And you also don’t know how every country is going to respond and they are responding. They are starting to cut trade deals with other people, etc. And even if you want to bring manufacturing back, it takes three to four [years], at a minimum, to build a real manufacturing plant.” As of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,940.

Ethereum Supply On Exchanges Has Continued Its Downtrend Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Supply on Exchanges for Ethereum. The “ Supply on Exchanges ” refers to an indicator that measures, as its name already suggests, the percentage of the total ETH supply that’s currently sitting in the wallets attached to centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are depositing a net number of tokens to these platforms. As one of the main reasons why holders may transfer their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the coin’s price. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies that supply is leaving the exchanges. Generally, investors withdraw their coins into self-custodial wallets when they plan to hold them in the long term, so such a trend can be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Supply on Exchanges for Ethereum over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Supply on Exchanges has been showing a long-term downtrend, but there have been periods of temporary deviation. One such phase came around the time of the bull run toward the end of 2024, a potential sign that some investors decided to exit from ETH during the profitable opportunity. In the months since the peak, though, the indicator has gone back to the downward trajectory, suggesting that holders have resumed their accumulation. Today, the metric is sitting at 4.9%, which is the lowest value ever recorded. In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the Supply on Exchanges of Bitcoin. It would appear that the number one cryptocurrency has also seen a trend of net outflows during the last few years and unlike ETH, there haven’t been any notable instances of deviation. Over the past five years, investors have withdrawn 1.7 million BTC from exchanges. This decline has taken the metric’s value to 7.1%, which is the lowest since November 2018. In the same period, ETH holders have taken out 15.3 million tokens of the asset from these platforms. Something to keep in mind is that while exchanges played a central role in the market years ago, that’s no longer strictly the case. The emergence of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) means there is now another major gateway into the sector, so exchange outflows may not carry quite the same impact as before anymore.

2025-05-21T07:00:40.000Z,"Binance Bitcoin Outflows and MVRV Ratio Point to Sustained Bullish Setup, Analyst Reveals","Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a slight retreat after reaching an intraday high of $106,704. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $104,686, reflecting a mere 0.4% increase in the last 24 hours. Despite this slight pullback, BTC remains within 3.8% of its all-time high of $109,000 set in January, indicating that bullish momentum is still largely intact. Amid this price performance, data suggests that BTC’s price behavior remains supported by strategic accumulation patterns rather than short-term speculation. The return of large-scale withdrawals from centralized exchanges like Binance and Kraken may be contributing to this reduced sell-side pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Update: Spot Demand Climbs As Short-Term Profits Lose Steam Exchange Outflows and MVRV Ratio Support Accumulation Thesis Amr Taha, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlighted a noteworthy shift in investor behavior. According to Taha’s latest analysis, over 3,090 BTC, valued at approximately $325 million, were withdrawn from Binance in a single day. This followed an earlier 76,000 ETH withdrawal from Binance and a separate 170,000 ETH exit from Kraken. These movements suggest investors are increasingly transferring assets off exchanges, a behavior typically linked to long-term holding strategies. Taha notes that this trend aligns with broader developments in the industry, such as Circle’s reported IPO plans and acquisition discussions involving Coinbase and Ripple. Taha’s analysis also emphasizes the importance of the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio in gauging market sentiment. Currently standing at 2.33, the MVRV remains below the 2.75 threshold that has historically triggered major corrections. The last instance of MVRV crossing that level coincided with a prolonged five-month downturn. In contrast, the current level suggests that Bitcoin is not yet in overheated territory, which could give the market room to move higher before heavy profit-taking begins. Bitcoin Market Structure Points to Reduced Sell Pressure Taha concludes that the market remains in an accumulation phase, driven by reduced exchange reserves and a neutral MVRV reading. The decline in exchange-held BTC supply lowers the risk of large-scale sell-offs, especially if buyer demand holds steady. This dynamic could help sustain the current uptrend, barring unexpected external shocks. Moreover, the combination of falling exchange balances and a sub-critical MVRV ratio paints a picture of a market not yet near euphoric excess. Instead, the conditions suggest a cautious optimism among investors, with many choosing to store rather than liquidate their holdings, according to Taha. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says The analyst added that the gradual offloading of exchange balances supports the view that institutional and large retail participants are still positioning for future upside. Should the MVRV ratio climb toward the historical trigger point of 2.75, that sentiment may begin to shift, but for now, on-chain indicators suggest that Bitcoin’s rally may still have room to grow.

And while Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, the true high-return setups may lie in the altcoins that are still early in their cycles. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE , Solana , and XRP enter the picture.

With its narrative-driven appeal, political branding, and capped supply structure, it has quickly become the go-to speculative play for traders who understand the power of timing. Early reports from analysts are already calling it a contender for 10,000%+ upside potential, backed by real market traction and rising demand. Stage 8 is currently open and attracting serious attention, with momentum accelerating by the hour. Hashex has completed its audit, and major crypto forums are naming MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of 2025’s most likely early-stage moonshots. The team is currently offering a 50% bonus for investors using the PATRIOT50X promo code, and with listings anticipated by Q3, time is running out for early accumulation. Solana Continues to Surge on Ecosystem Strength Solana (SOL) is showing no signs of slowing down. With high-speed performance, growing developer activity, and real-world partnerships driving volume, Solana is reclaiming its place among the top Layer-1s. Analysts are now projecting SOL’s next key leg could reach $300 and beyond, especially if demand for scalable applications continues to rise. XRP Builds Toward Its Biggest Breakout Yet XRP is once again gaining momentum. Now trading above $2.36, the token is set for a potential breakout with the CME aunch.

2025-05-21T06:36:22.000Z,"Bitcoin Futures Open Interest Zoom as BTC Inches Towards All-Time High; DOGE, ADA, XRP Add 4%","Bitcoin (BTC) is inches away from its all-time high, hovering over $107,000, with analysts eyeing a move higher in the coming days. Futures open interest across major exchanges hit $75 billion, an all-time high on Tuesday in U.S. dollar terms, signaling heightened speculative activity and leveraged positioning. That comes alongside a continued rally in spot markets, with BTC holding above $100,000 for more than 11 straight days — a sign, some traders say, of accumulation and strength at current levels. “The current price action appears to be a consolidation phase,” said Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, in an email to CoinDesk. “It’s marked by accumulation, potentially setting the stage for another leg higher that could lead to a new all-time high.” Bitcoin was changing hands above $107,500 as of Tuesday morning, up nearly 1.5% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) and Solana’s SOL added 2%, while dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano’s ADA and xrp (XRP) bumped 3%. Derivatives data support the bullish outlook. The call-to-put open interest ratio reached 1.55 this weekend. At the same time, premiums for out-of-the-money calls rose across the board, a sign traders are positioning for a breakout, HTX Research’s Chloe Zheng said in a weekend update shared with CoinDesk. Meanwhile, short-term implied volatility (IV) dropped to an 18-month low of 35–40%, reflecting a relatively calm backdrop despite rising positioning, HTX said. “This mix of euphoric sentiment and low volatility often conceals the build-up of excessive leverage,” HTX Research noted in a weekend update. “But under such conditions, Bitcoin could retest new highs within 30–45 days.” Still, resistance at the $107,000 level has held for now. FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in an email that the market is driven by “a crowd of retail investors” and momentum-chasing traders who remain undeterred by macro uncertainty or recent exchange security concerns. “Further dynamics will depend on changes in global risk appetite,” Kuptsikevich wrote. “If the resistance at $107K is broken, there are more chances to restore the uptrend. That opens a path toward $115K.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/21/bitcoin-futures-open-interest-zoomas-btc-inches-towards-all-time-high-doge-ada-xrp-add-4,"ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|XRP","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Futures|Dogecoin|Cardano|XRP|News",cryptocompare

Gox, Plans BTC Treasury","Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strive is seeking to acquire 75,000 Bitcoin, valued slightly over $8 billion, from claims related to the defunct Mt. Gox exchange bankruptcy. In a May 20 regulatory filing , Strive noted that the strategy is intended to purchase Bitcoin at a discount price. It enhances Bitcoin per share and supports the goal of outperforming Bitcoin over the long run, the company filing noted. Further, Strive has partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group, “to source and evaluate” Bitcoin claims that have received definitive legal judgments and are pending distribution. The company said that it requires shareholder approval to proceed with Mt. Gox claims. Besides, Strive would file a Form S-4 registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to present the full terms of the proposed transaction. After the filing, shareholders will receive a proxy statement to vote on the acquisition. Strive to Build Bitcoin Treasury Strive noted that the strategic transaction will allow the firm to build Bitcoin treasury. Early this month, the asset management firm revealed a blueprint to stockpile Bitcoin with a merger. During Bitcoin For Corporations at Strategy World 2025, the firm noted that it will merge with NASDAQ-listed Asset Entities to form a public Bitcoin Treasury Company. “Strive Asset Management believes the best current opportunity to maximize long-run value for corporations is to build a war chest of Bitcoin,” the company said in a detailed presentation . Furthermore, buying the Bitcoin claims would grow Strive’s BTC per share ratio ahead of the planned reverse merger with Asset Entities. Source: Strive Strive’s move to become a Bitcoin treasury firm comes as there is an institutional pivot towards the largest crypto. Recently, Jack Mallers-led firm, Twenty One Capital , said that it would hold over 42,000 Bitcoin at launch. The new Bitcoin treasury firm is backed by Tether and SoftBank Group. Mt. Gox to Repay Creditors by October The company is required to obtain shareholder approval soon, since Mt. Gox is planning to fully repay its creditors by October 2025 . The bankrupt exchange, which was once the largest Bitcoin exchange processing most global BTC trades, extended the deadline for its creditor repayment after a Tokyo court assigned a trustee to oversee the distribution of remaining assets to creditors. Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 following a massive security breach, leading to the loss of 950,000 BTC, a sum valued at over $102 billion today.

Gox at Discount appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Strive, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking to scoop up 75,000 Bitcoin tied to Mt. Gox, the bankrupt exchange that famously collapsed in 2014. These Bitcoins are part of claims that have already received legal clearance but haven’t yet been distributed. By acquiring them, Strive hopes to buy Bitcoin at a discount and boost its crypto holdings fast. The Plan Behind the Purchase In a May 20 filing , Strive revealed its partnership with 117 Castell Advisory Group to pursue the claims. The company says this move will help it grow its Bitcoin-per-share ratio ahead of its reverse merger with Asset Entities, a deal expected to wrap up by mid-2025. Interestingly, Strive hasn’t disclosed any Bitcoin holdings yet but claims it has more flexibility than typical public companies when it comes to buying BTC. What’s Next? Shareholder Green Light Before making a move, Strive will need shareholder approval. The firm is preparing a filing for the SEC and will send out a proxy statement to outline the deal and get the go-ahead. In the meantime, Mt. Gox is expected to repay its creditors by October 31, meaning Strive has to act fast. Mt. Gox was once the biggest Bitcoin exchange before a 2014 hack wiped out 750,000 BTC. Creditors have waited over a decade for repayment, and now companies like Strive are stepping in to grab discounted claims. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Bitcoin Heading to $600,000 by October 2025? , A Trend Among Bitcoin Treasury Firms Strive isn’t alone. New firms like Twenty One Capital , backed by Tether and SoftBank, are also diving into the Bitcoin treasury game, planning to launch with tens of thousands of BTC. Moreover, Strive’s merger partner , Asset Entities (ASST), has seen its stock skyrocket, jumping 18.2% on May 20 and up 1,170% since the merger news broke. Once the deal closes, Strive will control 94.2% of the merged company, which will continue trading under the ASST ticker. Strive Joins the Bitcoin Rush Overall, the move shows that Strive’s motive to buy more Bitcoin follows the lead of big players like Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. Just this week, Strategy grabbed 7,390 BTC worth nearly $765 million, bringing its stash to over 576,000 BTC. Metaplanet also added 1,004 BTC , now holding 7,800 in total. Everyone’s racing to load up on Bitcoin, and Strive wants in too. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Speaking at the New York City Crypto Summit on May 20, Adams said it has the potential to attract investment, create jobs, and cement New York’s position as a global centre for blockchain innovation. “We want to use the technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today,” Adams said during his speech, adding that the council would help position New York as the “crypto capital of the globe.” The advisory body will be composed of industry experts tasked with identifying use cases that serve the public interest. While full details of the council are still pending, Adams confirmed that a chairperson would be appointed and that key policy recommendations are expected in the coming weeks. Adams revealed that New York City is exploring blockchain use in administrative functions, including managing sensitive records like birth and death certificates. “Bringing blockchain security capabilities to the city means that birth certificates and death records can remain private but accessible,” he noted. Further, he added that the city is evaluating whether select services and taxes can be paid in cryptocurrency, as part of a broader initiative to modernise financial infrastructure. Financial services firm Figure, along with private equity groups Traction and Scale, are already supporting the city’s crypto roadmap. You might also like: New York bill proposes allowing crypto payments to state agencies Since taking office in January 2022, Adams has made cryptocurrency a key part of his policy agenda. He is well known for converting his first three mayoral paychecks into Bitcoin as a symbolic gesture of support . That vision is increasingly being echoed at the state level with top New York officials pushing for a pro-crypto environment. For instance, in April, Assembly member Clyde Vanel reintroduced a bill to allow New York agencies to accept cryptocurrency for fines, taxes, and other obligations. Vanel has also advocated for studying blockchain’s role in securing election systems and protecting voter data. If passed, his bill would require the State Board of Elections to deliver findings within a year. Separately, State Senator James Sanders Jr. has proposed a dedicated task force to assess how crypto and blockchain could reshape New York’s economy. The momentum isn’t limited to the Empire State. Across the U.S., at least 18 states are actively exploring legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

The flagship crypto has broken out of a two-week consolidation between $102,000 and $105,000 to reach fresh highs. Over the past six weeks, Bitcoin has rallied roughly 40%, and held above $100,000 for more than 11 days. Moreover, only four trading sessions in history have recorded a daily close above the current level, and last week’s close at $106,500 marked a new record. Source: Coingecko Moody’s Debt Downgrade Sparks Flight to Crypto Bitcoin’s surge has been propelled by a confluence of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Moody’s downgrade of US debt rattled confidence in traditional financial systems, while cooling trade war tensions between the US and China fostered risk-on sentiment. Meanwhile, persistent inflation has eroded fiat purchasing power, and the Federal Reserve’s cautious pace of rate cuts kept real yields elevated, dynamics that have boosted demand for Bitcoin as a hedge. Analysts Eye ETF Flows as Momentum Driver Spot Bitcoin ETFs have drawn substantial capital amid this backdrop. On May 20, they recorded a net inflow of $329m , marking a fifth straight day of positive flows. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw $64.9m in net inflows for a third consecutive day.

He said: “While the risk of a downside correction cannot be ruled out, particularly if negative sentiment returns to the equity markets, the likelihood of such a scenario remains relatively low in the short to medium term.” CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler said that if the 30-day moving average of the ratio between holders’ profits and losses on coins that have moved climbs above 200, it signals an overheated market. He noted the current reading is 99, so there’s no sign of excessive euphoria yet. With Bitcoin now flirting with its previous peak, market watchers say the next few trading days will be critical. If bulls sustain above $107,000 and clear $108,786, a test of fresh highs appears increasingly likely.

2025-05-21T06:12:34.000Z,"Listing FOMO builds as Bitcoin Pepe raises $1m in 24h","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin Pepe is turning heads as the first meme ICO on Bitcoin, raking in $1 million in 24 hours ahead of a May 31 listing set to shake up crypto’s most serious chain. There’s something brewing on Bitcoin that has the crypto crowd leaning in. Bitcoin Pepe has hauled in $1 million in just 24 hours, with its presale exploding ahead of a high-stakes May 31 listing. Bitcoin is holding strong above $100k in Q2 2025, pushing its market cap past $2.1 trillion, now surpassing giants like Google. Amid that macro strength, Bitcoin Pepe is exploding in popularity as it is doing the unthinkable: making Bitcoin fun again. It’s the world’s first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network, and it’s gone full viral. It’s a bold attempt to breathe new life into the BTC chain with utility, virality, and a serious nod to earning potential. This $10.5m raise at only $0.0359 is proof that the market sees real potential in the chain’s first meme-layer revolution. Here’s why. ‘Solana on Bitcoin’ goes live on May 31 Bitcoin’s already in the endgame; Wall Street’s all in, the suits are treating it like digital gold, and the fun’s been sucked out of the room. But Bitcoin Pepe is flipping the lights back on for everyone else. This is the first-ever meme ICO on Bitcoin, but the bigger story is what comes next: a foundation for a fully expressive, fast-moving crypto economy on the world’s most secure chain. At the heart of this push is PEP-20, a new token standard that lets anyone issue assets directly on Bitcoin, and that could be anything from NFTs to memecoins to other DeFi activities. It’s the same unlock ERC-20 gave Ethereum, and it could set off a similar explosion of user-generated assets, memes, and communities rooted in Bitcoin’s native layer. The Bitcoin memecoin supercycle is officially on. BPEP forecast: The real degen trade after BTC’s ATH? Bitcoin Pepe has eyes on a monster debut, and the charts could light up once it lists. Early chatter suggests that listings may occur on major platforms, including Bybit, OKX, and possibly others. That means access, exposure, and serious trading volume. As that May 31 launch creeps closer, don’t be surprised if BPEP starts pulling liquidity and attention away from the usual suspects. Bitcoin’s setting the tone, but this is the afterparty people actually want to be at. The fusion of BTC’s trust with Solana-style speed is the formula for retail frenzy, especially now that BTC itself is climbing and the broader market’s turning risk-on. Memecoin mania is already rebooting. Projects like Moo Deng and Goatseus Maximus are making a triple-digit comeback, showing just how fast this sector can flip bullish. Solana gave us a 1,000x run. Bitcoin Pepe might just outdo that because BPEP has something SOL never did: Bitcoin’s name, its trust, and its untapped potential. The slam’s coming Bitcoin has grown up, institutions treat it like digital gold, and it’s the reserve asset of the internet, but Bitcoin Pepe is what could pull retail back into the game. Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme ICO on Bitcoin. This alone puts it in the history books, but what happens next could write an entirely new chapter for meme culture on crypto’s most boomer chain. With Tier-1 listings locked in and over $10.5m raised, Bitcoin Pepe’s got the ball and is sprinting toward the rim. Just as Bitcoin makes headlines with trillion-dollar comparisons, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as the next leg of the trade, the slam after BTC’s alley-oop. Listings drop May 31. That’s less than 11 on the countdown.

2025-05-21T06:05:31.000Z,"Ethereum market overheats near $2.5K — is a short-term correction on the horizon?","Ethereum has climbed to around $2,540, approaching the key $2,500 level, but signs point to the market becoming overheated. According to a May 21 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets, trading volume has spiked as Ethereum ( ETH ) nears this resistance zone. This increase in activity has coincided with a spike in short-term profit-taking. When a market is said to be “overheating,” it typically means that prices have risen too quickly due to speculation rather than long-term conviction. In this instance, ETH’s quick 55% recovery over the last month after a 45% decline in Q1 raises the possibility that the rally may be about to pause or reverse. The overheated market suggests a potential short-term pullback, creating room for fresh accumulation once conditions stabilize. Technical data supports this view. The relative strength index, at 69, is hovering just below the overbought zone, a level that often precedes short-term corrections. Meanwhile, momentum is still positive and all of the major moving averages, from the 10-day to the 200-day, are pointing upward. This suggests that there is still strong underlying support even when the current price action has stalled. Ethereum price analysis. Credit: crypto.news If Ethereum is unable to break $2,700, it may retreat to the $2,300–$2,350 range, where support is starting to form. If there is a more significant correction, prices may approach $2,100. However, the rally may continue if ETH makes a strong breakout above $2,700 on high volume, particularly if there are positive developments to back up the breakout. You might also like: Ethereum exchange supply drops to 10-year low amid strong whale accumulation — is $3000 ETH price incoming? Behind the scenes, large players appear to be positioning for what could come next. On-chain data shows that since late April, large holders, wallets with more than 10,000 ETH, have accumulated more than 450,000 ETH. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Ethereum exchange-traded funds have seen $108 million in net inflows over the past month, according to SoSoValue data . Now, a significant catalyst is approaching. By June 1st, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to make a decision regarding the inclusion of staking in ETH ETFs. By allowing institutions to earn yield from these regulated products, it could stir a new wave of demand. Along with the demand for ETFs, London-based asset manager Abraxas Capital purchased 350,703 ETH, worth about $837 million, between May 7 and May 20. With favorable on-chain trends and increasing institutional appetite, Ethereum’s long-term narrative seems intact despite short-term pressures.

2025-05-21T06:05:08.000Z,"Tron (TRX) and Justin Sun Crisis in the US Congress: SEC Chairman Paul Atkins Makes a Statement","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins faces tough questions from Congress just weeks after taking office. Speaking before the House Budget Committee, Atkins was questioned about memecoin projects linked to President Donald Trump and his possible ties to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun. Democratic Representative Glenn Ivey drew attention to some events that took place before Trump’s inauguration in January. Ivey brought up the $30 million token purchase by Tron, a company owned by Justin Sun, from decentralized finance firm World Liberty Financial, which said it was inspired by Trump. The SEC later suspended the fraud case against Justin Sun and his companies. This development led to various speculations in the public. On the other hand, a memecoin connected to Trump is currently trading on the market and Trump is preparing to hold a special gala for the first 220 memecoin investors this week. “This situation doesn’t smell good to me, frankly. I hope the SEC looks into this connection,” Ivey said. Atkins, on the other hand, stated that the case against Sun is still “active” and reminded that the SEC does not classify memecoins as securities. Related News: Analyst Warns: “Bitcoin's Record High Has No Meaning, Focus on This Level Instead” Atkins, who was appointed by Trump, said that the institution had entered a “new era” after his predecessor Gary Gensler took a “hostile” stance against the crypto industry. During Gensler’s term, the SEC filed numerous lawsuits against the industry, but some of them were later dropped. In his written statement, Atkins described his plan for crypto regulation as “rulemaking through a notice and comment process.” “My primary goal during my presidency will be to develop a sound regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that operates with clear rules,” he said. “This framework will continue to deter malicious actors who engage in illegal activities while regulating issuance, custody and trading processes.” Republican Representative Chuck Edwards asked whether the SEC’s newly established crypto task force needed additional funding. The task force, established earlier this year by former interim chairman Mark Uyeda and led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, aims to clarify how securities laws apply to crypto by holding roundtables with industry representatives. “I don’t have a definitive opinion,” Atkins said. “The task force is comprised of existing staff and led by Commissioner Peirce, so there is no additional budget request,” he added. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-21T06:00:27.000Z,"Bitcoin Skyrockets — Yet MAGACOIN FINANCE Quietly Outpaces Solana and XRP 10 to 1","Bitcoin’s Rally Captures Headlines, But Altcoins Are Gaining Faster Bitcoin (BTC) has officially crossed the $105,000 mark, setting a new benchmark for 2025 and igniting optimism across global markets. Institutional inflows remain steady, and long-term projections toward $250,000 are now more widely accepted than ever. But while Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, savvy investors are noticing a much faster-moving trend under the surface—one that’s shifting momentum toward smaller, faster, and more narrative-driven altcoins. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. Quietly but rapidly, it has begun outpacing some of the biggest names in the space—including Solana , XRP , and HBAR —by wide margins. This isn’t just early hype. It’s a signal. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Why Everyone’s Talking About MAGACOIN FINANCE Right Now The speed at which MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing the radar has taken many by surprise. Originally launched as a politically inspired altcoin, it’s since gained serious market traction thanks to strong fundamentals, bold branding, and capped supply mechanics that reward early positioning. What’s making traders pay close attention is the clear divergence in performance. While larger caps are still consolidating, MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown consistent growth in both volume and community strength. Early metrics suggest it’s outperforming some competitors by as much as 10 to 1 —and that gap could widen once listings begin. A transparent roadmap, and rising organic attention, this project is no longer flying under the radar. Many believe it may become one of 2025’s defining early-stage altcoin stories. Solana Holds Support, But Lacks Immediate Breakout Solana (SOL) remains one of the most technically robust Layer-1s, but recent weeks have seen it trade in a tight range. Developers continue to build, but traders seeking rapid upside are beginning to rotate into faster-moving opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE while SOL consolidates. XRP Eyes Expansion but Faces Resistance XRP is stable above $2.30 and remains in accumulation mode ahead of the CME Futures launch. While long-term fundamentals are strong, short-term growth has slowed, giving investors time to seek higher-velocity opportunities elsewhere. HBAR Builds Slowly on Utility Strength HBAR continues to add enterprise-grade partnerships and long-term value through real-world integrations. However, its price performance has yet to reflect these developments, leading more aggressive investors to allocate toward higher-momentum plays. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Bitcoin’s rally is undeniable—but for those seeking real movement, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight. With stronger growth than Solana , XRP , and HBAR combined, it’s emerging as one of the most compelling early-stage opportunities of 2025. For traders focused on speed, scarcity, and outsized return potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the move others are too late to catch.

2025-05-21T05:55:52.000Z,"Best crypto to buy as Standard Chartered sees BTC hitting $500K","Bitcoin (BTC) price has stabilized around $107,570 on Wednesday, maintaining momentum just 3% below its record high set on January 20. The cryptocurrency broke above the key $105,000 resistance level earlier this week and has since retested and held this level as support multiple times, including on Tuesday. The ability to maintain this level could serve as a springboard for a potential retest of the all-time high, should bullish sentiment persist. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) also remain firm above their respective support zones, helping to reinforce broader market stability. While Bitcoin remains the foundational asset of the crypto ecosystem and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty, its growing institutional adoption and declining volatility have made it less attractive to investors seeking outsized, asymmetric returns. In contrast, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are drawing increased attention from risk-tolerant investors. As sentiment improves across the broader market, such tokens stand to benefit disproportionately from renewed speculative inflows. Bitcoin may rocket to $500,000 Standard Chartered’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoffrey Kendrick, has reiterated the bank’s long-term bullish stance on Bitcoin, projecting the cryptocurrency could reach $500,000 before the end of US President Donald Trump’s term in 2029. In a report released Tuesday, Kendrick pointed to the latest first-quarter 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as validation of growing institutional and government interest in Bitcoin. These filings, which are required of asset managers overseeing more than $100 million, revealed an uptick in indirect Bitcoin exposure — a trend Kendrick believes supports the thesis that broader institutional adoption is underway. “The quarterly 13F data is the best test of our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures, helping the price reach our USD 500,000 target level,” Kendrick told investors. While ETF exposure reportedly declined in the first quarter, Kendrick described the rise in exposure via Strategy shares — referring to MicroStrategy (MSTR) — as “very encouraging.” He noted that some government-related entities may be using MicroStrategy’s stock as a workaround to gain Bitcoin exposure in jurisdictions where direct holdings are restricted. “We believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings,” he said. Kendrick’s $500,000 price target remains among the most ambitious on Wall Street, signaling confidence in a long-term adoption cycle that increasingly intersects with public-sector interest and regulatory accommodation. Why should you look at Bitcoin Pepe as BTC looks to make new highs A renewed rally in Bitcoin, underpinned by surging institutional demand, has historically triggered broader momentum across the cryptocurrency market, and the current uptrend is proving no different. As capital flows back into the ecosystem, speculative tokens, particularly meme coins, are once again drawing heightened interest. Positioned squarely at the intersection of meme culture and infrastructure innovation, Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a standout contender in this speculative cycle. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 on the Bitcoin network, the project blends Bitcoin’s security with the scalability of Solana-like architecture. Bitcoin Pepe has also announced several strategic partnerships aimed at expanding its Layer 2 ecosystem for meme culture on Bitcoin. These include Super Meme for secure meme coin launches via PEP-20, Catamoto for BASE chain fair launches, and Plena Finance to potentially integrate BPEP into mobile-first DeFi. The project also joins hands with GETE Network to potentially bring BPEP into cross-chain Web3 gaming. Together, these collaborations strengthen Bitcoin Pepe’s infrastructure, extend its reach across ecosystems, and bring practical use cases to its token beyond speculation. Investor enthusiasm has already taken shape, with Bitcoin Pepe ’s presale raising over $10 million to date. The BPEP token is priced at $0.0359, and the presale is scheduled to conclude on May 31, 2025. An exchange listing is expected shortly thereafter, a development that could serve as a short-term catalyst for price discovery.

2025-05-21T05:30:47.000Z,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows","On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade’s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it’s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric’s value goes down, it’s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn’t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. “Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) – but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),” notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week.

2025-05-21T05:30:00.000Z,"Strive Buys Discounted BTC While Germany Sells Billions Too Early","Bitcoin asset management strategies are diverging sharply between governments and institutions. In 2024, the German government liquidated nearly 50,000 Bitcoin at an average price of $57,900, missing out on more than $2 billion in gains as BTC surged past $106,000. Meanwhile, US-based investment firm Strive is taking the opposite approach and accumulating Bitcoin by purchasing distressed Mt. Gox claims at a discount. Strive Targets Mt. Gox Claims to Expand Bitcoin Holdings Ahead of Asset Entities Merger Vivek Ramaswamy’s Bitcoin strategy is entering a bold new phase. Strive, the investment firm co-founded by the former Republican presidential candidate, has disclosed a plan to acquire distressed Bitcoin claims from the long-defunct Mt. Gox exchange, an aggressive play designed to accelerate its transformation into a full-fledged Bitcoin treasury company. In a May 20 regulatory filing , Strive revealed it has partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target legally validated but undelivered claims tied to over 75,000 BTC—currently worth more than $8 billion at market prices. These claims are part of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate, which has yet to fully repay creditors more than a decade after the infamous 2014 collapse. The move, according to Strive, is aimed at acquiring Bitcoin at a significant discount compared to current spot prices. Since Mt. Gox claimants are often willing to accept less than full value in order to gain liquidity, Strive sees the opportunity as both financially compelling and strategic. By accumulating BTC through discounted claims, Strive aims to increase its Bitcoin -per-share ratio, thereby enhancing shareholder value, especially ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities (ASST), a publicly traded social media marketing company. Unlike a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) structure, which imposes additional regulatory and operational constraints, Strive argues the reverse merger offers greater flexibility in executing Bitcoin purchases and treasury management strategies. Advantages of going public via a reverse merger (Source: Strive ) The firm said it will soon file a proxy statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) outlining the full terms of the proposed Mt. Gox transaction. Shareholder approval will be required before Strive can proceed, and time is of the essence as Mt. Gox’s trustee is expected to begin full creditor repayments by Oct. 31, 2025. If Strive successfully acquires the claims before the repayment window closes, it could secure a substantial BTC cache at steep discounts, an outcome that would immediately elevate its standing among corporate Bitcoin holders. Mt. Gox: A Brief Background Once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after a massive security breach led to the loss of approximately 750,000 BTC, worth just hundreds of millions at the time, but tens of billions today. Since then, trustees have recovered and secured more than 140,000 BTC, with various entities and individuals holding legal claims. The repayment process has been slow and complicated by legal wrangling, evolving crypto regulations, and logistical hurdles. Strive is now capitalizing on this complexity, hoping to become a middleman between Mt. Gox and the open market by acquiring the right to those BTC allocations from existing claimants. Strive’s pivot toward Bitcoin mirrors a growing trend among companies looking to embed BTC into their balance sheets as a strategic reserve asset, a movement gaining significant momentum in 2025. A key example is Twenty One Capital, the Jack Mallers-backed Bitcoin treasury startup, which is preparing to launch with 42,000 BTC and has received strategic backing from Tether, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald. The firm is also merging via a blank-check deal with Cantor Equity Partners. Asset Entities Stock Surges on Merger News The market has responded positively to Strive’s plans. Shares of Asset Entities (ASST) surged 18.2% on May 20, closing at $7.74, according to Google Finance. The surge puts its current market capitalization at $122.1 million, representing a staggering 1,170% gain since the merger was first announced on May 7. Asset Entities share price (Source: Google Finance ) Following the reverse merger, Strive is expected to control 94.2% of the combined company, with Asset Entities shareholders retaining the remaining 5.8%. The merged firm will continue trading under the ASST ticker, but will operate under the unified brand name: Strive and Asset Entities. With strong market interest, favorable legal timing, and a clear path to gaining discounted BTC exposure, Strive is positioning itself to become a major corporate holder of Bitcoin, potentially rivaling firms like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Tether in scale and ambition. For Strive, the combination of a Bitcoin accumulation strategy and a reverse public market entry could establish a new model for digital asset treasury management. The firm is betting that Bitcoin’s long-term value appreciation will outweigh the risks involved in acquiring legacy claims. Should shareholder approval be granted and the Mt. Gox repayment schedule remain on track, the next six months could be transformative—not just for Strive, but for the emerging corporate Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. With regulatory oversight intensifying and macroeconomic volatility shaking confidence in fiat currencies, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly attractive hedge, and Strive is among the latest to make a bold, strategic bet. German Government Missed Out on Over $2 Billion in Bitcoin Gains After 2024 Sell-Off Meanwhile, Germany’s federal authorities may have inadvertently cost taxpayers billions of dollars by selling off a massive trove of Bitcoin far too early, according to a new analysis by blockchain intelligence platform Arkham. The decision to liquidate tens of thousands of BTC in mid-2024 has now become a cautionary tale in the world of government-managed digital assets, with missed profits exceeding $2.35 billion. In a post on X, Arkham revealed that a wallet labeled “German Government (BKA)” sold 49,858 BTC, worth around $2.89 billion at the time, between June and July of 2024. The average sale price of approximately $57,900 now looks deeply discounted in hindsight, as Bitcoin currently trades above $106,000, per CoinMarketCap. “If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24 billion,” Arkham stated. Seized Bitcoin Sold in Haste The funds were originally believed to have been confiscated by German law enforcement from Movie2k, a major piracy platform that was shut down in 2013. The site’s operators reportedly laundered tens of millions of euros through digital assets, including the nearly 50,000 BTC eventually transferred into a government-controlled wallet. The first signs of an impending sell-off emerged on June 19, 2024, when the wallet made a transfer of 6,500 BTC, valued at over $425 million, triggering speculation among analysts and market watchers about a coordinated liquidation strategy. However, that speculation quickly turned into confusion and concern as on-chain activity revealed that the German government was dispersing the BTC across multiple exchanges, rather than working with over-the-counter (OTC) desks or institutional brokers. The move sparked volatility in the Bitcoin markets and drew criticism for its lack of tactical finesse. Timeline of events (Source: CoinMarketCap) While the government’s intention may have been to maximize liquidity or preempt regulatory or market risks, the aftermath of the sale paints a stark picture. Arkham estimates that the early exit cost Germany over $2.35 billion in potential profit, given Bitcoin’s explosive 80% rally since the sell-off. Bitcoin’s price dipped sharply throughout June and early July 2024, a period that coincided with the BKA wallet’s most active selling. Analysts believe it was not the sheer amount of BTC sold, but rather the public knowledge of the sale that intensified bearish sentiment across the market. Bitcoin Price Recovers After Wallet Drains Interestingly, Bitcoin staged a recovery almost immediately after the German government wallet was depleted. On July 14, 2024, BTC rose back above the psychologically important $60,000 level, marking the end of a multi-week period of price suppression and investor caution. Amid the turmoil, Tron founder Justin Sun publicly offered to purchase the government’s Bitcoin stack, valued at over $2.3 billion at the time, directly from the state, in order to “minimize market impact.” Sun’s proposal echoed a broader conversation within crypto circles about transparency, responsibility, and the systemic risk posed by large, sudden liquidations of digital assets by public institutions. Lessons for Global Regulators The German experience is now likely to serve as a reference point for other countries managing seized or tax-recovered crypto assets. Several governments, including the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, have begun exploring digital asset auctions or structured sales to reduce adverse market effects. As more jurisdictions deal with seized digital assets, analysts suggest governments should collaborate more closely with crypto-native custodians, financial advisors, and institutional trading desks to optimize their strategy—and reduce public losses. The missed windfall comes at a time when Bitcoin has increasingly been embraced by institutional investors, ETFs, and corporate treasuries as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical instability. In 2025 alone, inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $20 billion, and sovereign wealth funds are rumored to be testing crypto allocations. Germany, one of the EU’s most economically powerful nations, had the rare opportunity to become a top sovereign Bitcoin holder. Instead, its decision to sell may go down as one of the most financially shortsighted in the history of public crypto asset management.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9204/strive-buys-discounted-btc-while-germany-sells-billions-too-early,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ARKM","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T05:23:51.000Z,"Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill Advances Toward Final Approval","The post Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill Advances Toward Final Approval appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Texas House of Representatives has cleared the second reading of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill ( SB 21 ), moving the state one step closer to officially entering the crypto space. The bill seeks to create the “Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” which would allow the state to invest in Bitcoin as part of its financial strategy. With the Senate already on board, the proposal now awaits the governor’s final approval. The 8th largest economy in the world will now be allowed to buy Bitcoin. This is indeed a bullish start!

According to the Texas Blockchain Council, the bill is scheduled for a vote in the House and, if passed, will mark a historic move toward Bitcoin adoption at the state level. Texas is following in President Trump’s footsteps by calling for a national Bitcoin reserve . However, other states like New Hampshire and Arizona have already passed similar measures, beating Texas in the race to lead U.S. crypto integration. What’s Next? Lee Bratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council told Axios that while SB 21 sets up the reserve, separate legislation is being prepared to decide how much Bitcoin the state will actually allocate to the fund. That decision, however, remains pending. If signed into law, Texas could soon become a major player in government-backed Bitcoin investments, further cementing the state’s pro-crypto stance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Data from Deribit's BTC options market, tracked by Amberdata, shows dealers or market makers hold a large net \"" negative gamma\"" exposure at the $110,000 level. Dealers holding negative gamma typically trade/hedge in the direction of the market to maintain their overall market exposure delta neutral. That, in turn, amplifies bearish and bullish moves.

2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC.

Such a move would trigger the liquidation of heavily leveraged bearish positions, likely accelerating the push to a new all-time high. However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

This skew suggests a higher probability of the price pushing upward to chase liquidity on the sell-side rather than dropping lower.Technical analyst Gert van Lagen noted a similar outlook, stating, “A liquidation magnet is glowing above $107K, ready to vaporize billions in shorts. First, BTC soared on fear. Next, it'll rise on liquidations.”Bitcoin liquidity levels.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation.

2025-05-20T12:18:57.000Z,"India’s Supreme Court urges government to regulate cryptocurrency","India’s Supreme Court has questioned the government’s lack of regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies despite imposing taxes on digital assets like Bitcoin.According to Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the growing use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies while remaining largely unregulated.“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins and is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.Kant further highlighted that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.“If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said.Related: Indian high court orders steps to block Proton MailGovernment says review may followThe Additional Solicitor General of India — a senior legal officer representing the government of India — reportedly answered the request by saying that the government “will take instructions, my lord,” indicating that the government may consider reviewing the country’s current cryptocurrency regulation.The report follows a May 5 hearing by the Supreme Court of India during which Kant and lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani shared their views on cryptocurrency. Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.”India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators.

The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction.“Namely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,“ the Maelstrom announcement states.A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen’s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach:“We believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.“Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure — zkSNACKs CEOPayjoin: Soon in wallets near you?Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets.

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T03:08:27.000Z,"SEC’s Crenshaw says agency playing ‘regulatory Jenga’ with crypto","The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s sole Democratic Commissioner has said the agency is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga” with its approach to the crypto industry and market regulation under the Trump administration. In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.”Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.”Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-crenshaw-agency-playing-regulatory-jenga-with-crypto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility.The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio.

Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!”While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic newsletter, pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.Backlash in the courtsThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data.

2025-05-19T21:32:21.000Z,"What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinner","On May 22, US President Donald Trump is expected to host up to 220 people who had purchased the most significant quantities of his memecoin at a private event in Washington, DC.Though the exact number of attendees was unknown as of May 19, reports and blockchain data have revealed some of the tokenholders who qualified to apply for the May 22 dinner and “VIP tour” and reception, presumed to be in the White House. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22. The Democratic Party’s arm in Arlington, Virginia, announced its members would gather to oppose those in the White House “cashing in on their public office.” Cointelegraph reached out to the organization for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Buying influence, or just speculating on an emerging market?The top 220 tokenholders reportedly spent a combined $148 million to have the opportunity to attend the event, which finalized its leaderboard on May 12. However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.Bitcoin 1-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chThe annualized one-month futures premium for Bitcoin remained close to 6% despite the retest of $102,000 support. This current level is within the 5% to 10% neutral range, which has been the norm over the past week. While at first glance such data might suggest a lack of optimism, at the same time, it proves that the buying pressure is coming from the spot market rather than from leveraged bets.Japan bond spike and credit fears weigh on Bitcoin sentimentSome analysts attribute Bitcoin’s correction to comments by Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the country’s fiscal situation being “undoubtedly extremely poor,” as reported by Bloomberg. Japan 15-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China.

A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline.

That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $5 and the all-time high of $5.37.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T18:00:15.000Z,"‘Before Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar’ — Ledn co-founder","Before discovering Bitcoin (BTC), Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo found success shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar as it rapidly lost value against the stronger US dollar. Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus. Source: CointelegraphThis was part of the motivation behind launching Ledn, a Cayman Islands-based company that gives Bitcoin holders the ability to access dollar liquidity without having to sell their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” said di Bartolomeo, adding:“This creates a bit of a virtuous cycle that we see happen time and again with real estate, with borrowing against your stock, borrowing against your gold, and so Bitcoin is no different.”Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execCrypto lending market on the riseLedn operates in a much broader crypto lending industry that has grown over the past five years due to the rapid appreciation of Bitcoin, the arrival of institutional investors and the growing utility of stablecoins.By the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto lending market was valued at $30.2 billion, a more than threefold increase compared to two years earlier, according to Galaxy Research. However, the size of the overall industry remains below the 2021 peak. The researchers attributed the recent rise to decentralized finance applications, which allow users to borrow against assets onchain. This trend was further corroborated by a recent Cointelegraph report, which documented the growing monetary value secured by DeFi lending protocols. The crypto lending market has rebounded sharply from its 2022 lows but remains well below the peak from 2021.

2025-05-19T17:55:05.000Z,"Ripple launches cross-border blockchain payments in UAE","Ripple, the creator of cryptocurrency XRP (XRP), launched cross-border blockchain payments in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a development that could spur the adoption of cryptocurrency in a country receptive to digital assets.Zand Bank, the UAE’s first all-digital bank, and Mamo, a fintech company that offers a digital payment platform for businesses, will be the principal users of the blockchain payments system, according to a May 19 Ripple announcement.Zand Bank and Mamo will use “Ripple Payments” to facilitate cross-border blockchain payments. Ripple Payments is a platform that combines stablecoins, cryptocurrency, and fiat to enable payments and quick settlement times, a feature of Web3 that cross-border traditional finance payment systems often lack. Ripple was licensed to offer crypto payments by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March.Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, said acquiring this license “enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, such as high fees, long settlement times, and lack of transparency, in one of the world’s largest cross-border payments hubs.”Related: Ripple, Chipper Cash partner for faster and cheaper African remittancesUAE ranked 56 out of 151 countries for crypto adoptionChainalysis, a blockchain data platform, ranked the United Arab Emirates 56th out of 151 countries for crypto adoption, according to a 2024 report.

2025-05-19T17:17:19.000Z,"Bitcoin ignores Moody’s US debt downgrade, rallies back to $105K after profit-taking sell-off","Key takeaways:Bitcoin recovered from its sharp sell-off from $107,000, suggesting it functions as a hedge against uncertainty for investors reacting to Moody’s recent downgrade of US debt.Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing a $36 trillion debt and rising deficits, causing market turbulence and a spike in US Treasury yields.Despite short-term pressure from macroeconomic shifts, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish due to cautious shorting and a weakening US dollar.Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a sharp 4% correction during the Asian trading session on May 19, tumbling from an “important level” as noted by Glassnode. The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin could face continued pressure in the short term as investors pivot to safer assets amid rising uncertainty and borrowing costs.However, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. on X highlighted a shift in market sentiment, noting that traders betting on price declines have been “significantly more cautious” in building short positions during this bull cycle compared to 2021. This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX.

In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market. As of now, 10 platforms are licensed, while 15 have either withdrawn or been rejected.Eight applicants in Hong Kong still wait the SFC’s decision. Source: Securities and Futures CommissionHong Kong has made further strides with the listing of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) ETFs, and recently approved staking within Ether ETFs, which is not yet permitted in the US. It has also introduced stablecoin sandboxes under the supervision of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to trial approved digital assets in a controlled environment.“Sandboxes are an experiment, so too are staking ETFs,” said Kelvin Koh, a Spartan Group co-founder. “The key point is that these experiments are happening in Hong Kong.”Hong Kong recently released its ASPIRe roadmap in February 2025, which aims to foster blockchain innovation and fill regulatory gaps to set the city up as a global crypto hub.Hong Kong’s five-pillar strategy to become a crypto hub.

As Arvin Abraham, partner at law firm Goodwin’s private equity group, told Cointelegraph, crypto was once central to Sunak’s competitiveness agenda, but under the current Labour government, that focus has faded.The new Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, spearheaded by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, highlights fintech as a priority without a focus solely on crypto.“The UK does not feel like it’s prioritizing it as much as it was a few years ago,” Abraham said.In January, Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its UK office to move back to the US. Source: Anthony AlbaneseAbraham added the UK remains “one of the best places to set up a new startup,” especially for early-stage capital raising. He points to generous tax incentives for angel investors and the unique convergence of finance and startups in London, calling it “probably one of the best cities in the world for fintech-type businesses.” In that sense, even without headline-grabbing crypto policy, the UK’s structural appeal still draws Web3 firms — just now with a quieter backdrop.Magazine: South Africa’s digital-nomad crypto hub: Cape Town, Crypto City Guide",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cash-code-crypto-hub-uk-us-singapore?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
