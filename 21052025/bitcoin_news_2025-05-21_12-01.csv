2025-05-21T09:53:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Surpasses Google and Meta—Best Crypto to Buy Now","Bitcoin’s market cap exceeds global tech giants Google and Meta, surpassing $2.12 trillion as the BTC price approaches an all-time high. Easing trade tensions creates improved market conditions, which fuel institutional digital asset adoption. As the May 31 listing nears, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) witnesses increasing inflows, gaining traction as the best crypto to buy this altseason. The first and biggest blockchain network, Bitcoin, has achieved a new milestone: its market cap has reached $2.12 trillion for the first time. BTC is now more valuable than major global corporations like Google, valued at $2.022 trillion, and Meta, valued at $1.6 trillion. Image courtesy: CoinMarketCap From the April low of $74,420, the Bitcoin price has surged 43.67% to a 4-month high of $107,137. Bitcoin's historic achievement comes after significant diplomatic developments on the global stage. US President Donald Trump has announced major trade deals, one being with the UK and another ongoing with China. Positive developments in global trade deals have eased tensions in the financial market, improving investors' overall risk appetite. This achievement has made Bitcoin rise in rankings in global assets and has also given a boost to crypto adoption.

Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, has predicted that the Bitcoin price could reach $200k by the end of 2025, while the long-term outlook for 2028 is suggested at $500k. Bitcoin price holds $105K; 10 DMA becomes key support zone Bitcoin's price has reclaimed the $105,000 level after dipping to a low of $102,000 on Monday. With this bounce, $105k and the 10-DMA have now become critical support. This zone, previously a resistance point in early 2025, has been successfully back-tested. According to the chart analysis, BTC's recent close above $105K, combined with a strong candle body and downside wick, signals growing demand from lower levels. Image Courtesy: TradingView If the Bitcoin price can break past $108K with conviction, analysts believe a new all-time high (ATH) may follow in May. $BTC GOLDEN CROSS INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/u7HTp7F06w — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) May 19, 2025 According to the analyst MisterCrypto, BTC is forming a golden cross in the daily timeframe with a price target of $160, according to the measured target method. The golden cross forms when the 50-day SMA crosses over the 200-day SMA and is seen as a signal for upcoming price surges. While Bitcoin leads the charge, micro-caps are the ones that create wealth for investors. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is one of the best cryptos to buy now, which aligns with the long-term trend of crypto adoption and more awareness of decentralization and accessibility in equal measure. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): Biggest play on Bitcoin Bitcoin Pepe is one of the emerging projects that could directly benefit from Bitcoin’s rising dominance in global finance. This platform is built to grow by Bitcoin’s increasing market capitalization as it enables a meme launchpad on BTC’s $2 trillion liquidity. Major networks like SOL and ETH have had meme manias in recent years, but have you wondered why there haven’t been any memes on the Bitcoin network? Previous attempts have faced technical difficulties, preventing success, but BPEP has pulled it off with the PEP-20 standard, which will allow the launch of memes on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin has always been a valuable asset. Now, Bitcoin Pepe is making it a leader in meme and retail trading. This layer-2 meme platform could revolutionize the sector by combining Bitcoin’s security with the speed and scalability of Solana. Some devs are calling it “Solana on Bitcoin.” Additionally, Bitcoin Pepe is establishing major ties with influential crypto projects like Super Meme, Plena Finance, and GETE Network, spanning DeFi, AI, and gaming. This move will significantly enhance BPEP’s utility across multiple sectors. Time to stop sleeping on $BPEP as you're going to regret it laterSeen they've got some major partnerships lined up too.Heard the tier 1's are after this one... I'd stack now while you can. https://t.co/T3kuv2iX4G — Zenia (@Zenia_sol) May 14, 2025 Investor confidence in the project has increased exponentially as the staking pools, totaling over 200 million tokens, are now completely sold out due to high demand. Moreover, the ongoing token presale has raised $10.7m in a short period of time. There is only a brief period of time remaining to buy BPEP tokens at an undervalued price of $0.0359 as the presale is racing towards its May 31st Tier 1 exchange listings. Cardano jumps 20% monthly—can it sustain the rally? ADA rose 20% in the last 30 days because of the positive advancements combined with market optimism about network upgrades. Development activity continues to grow on the ADA network thanks to its regular upgrades. Scalability plans alongside strong interoperability functions enable Cardano to develop its position in the market over time. The price movement of ADA faces huge challenges because market conditions and community enthusiasm for new developments tend to drive price changes. The potential increase of ADA might face difficulties because of diminishing investor attention and technical challenges that could disrupt its market position. Best crypto to buy for the biggest bull cycle Bitcoin price holding above $105K is a powerful signal for the broader market. As BTC eyes a breakout above $110K, altcoins are preparing for liftoff. Cardano’s strong rebound reflects ongoing buyer interest, while Bitcoin Pepe offers one of the most lucrative opportunities of the year. With a public presale offering access at just $0.0359, BPEP stands out as a top-tier pick for investors seeking long-term growth. FAQs What is the best crypto to buy now? Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is currently the top cryptocurrency to consider buying. As the first meme coin launching directly on the Bitcoin network, it introduces the PEP-20 token standard, enabling users to create and trade tokens natively on Bitcoin's Layer 2. With its presale concluding on May 31, BPEP is poised for significant growth upon listing on major centralized exchanges. When is Bitcoin Pepe launching? Bitcoin Pepe will list on centralized exchanges on May 31, after wrapping up its 30-stage presale. Is Caradno a good investment? Cardano (ADA) is considered a promising long-term investment in 2025. Its expanding DeFi ecosystem, which recently surpassed $700 million in total value locked, and growing adoption of smart contracts have enhanced its utility and market appeal. Analysts forecast ADA's price to range between $0.66 and $2.36 by the end of 2025, with some projections reaching up to $2.05, reflecting potential for significant growth. Will Bitcoin reach $250k? As of May 21, 2025, Bitcoin is trading around $107,844 . While a rise to $250,000 would require significant market momentum, the current trends and expert analyses suggest it's within the realm of possibility.

2025-05-21T09:51:58.000Z,"Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Reiterates Ripple (XRP) Mission","Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, expressed concern over Senator Cynthia Lummis’ recent cancellation of a meeting with him and her office’s refusal to reschedule. He seized the medium to reiterate Ripple’s mission in the United States and worldwide. In a post on X, Garlinghouse emphasized that Ripple has failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with the Senator in the last six years, despite being a U.S.-based company actively working to expand the domestic crypto economy. Garlinghouse acknowledged that last-minute changes are often unavoidable in a senator’s daily schedule. However, he took issue with the outright refusal to find another time to meet. He stated that the response from Lummis’ staff that the meeting can’t be rescheduled was troubling. He added, “I really have to wonder if this was Sen. Lummis or someone on her staff making this decision.” Thanks for this info. Certainly enlightening that Will Cole is related to Sen Lummis. I understand that things happen in a Senator’s day that force their schedules to change, but for a Congressional staff to say \""unable to reschedule” is really troubling (when we've been unable… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 Potential Conflicts of Interest Surface The situation has gained further attention as new information about Senator Lummis’ personal and financial ties to the Bitcoin industry has emerged. Will Cole, Head of Product at a Bitcoin payments company, was identified by one community member as Lummis’ son-in-law. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cole is a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and has previously shared content criticizing Ripple and Garlinghouse. His recent repost of a post mocking Garlinghouse has increased scrutiny of the Senator’s impartiality. What further raises questions is the fact that Lummis has received financial support from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z), a known backer of various crypto and blockchain projects. Lummis has been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin and is considered one of Congress’s most prominent Bitcoin-aligned lawmakers. These affiliations could explain the Senator’s reluctance to engage with Ripple, a company often positioned in opposition to Bitcoin maximalism. While no formal accusations of misconduct have been made, observers in the crypto community are questioning whether the Senator’s personal and familial connections are influencing her professional decisions. A popular attorney called Bitcoin maximalists immature as they jumped on the situation, attempting to paint it as a victory for BTC, failing to see the harm their actions can do to the crypto market. What’s Next for the Crypto Industry Garlinghouse and others at Ripple have consistently advocated for regulatory clarity, industry support in Washington, and an inclusive approach to crypto regulation. The inability to secure a meeting with Senator Lummis, who has positioned herself as a leader on digital asset policy, has raised concerns about favoritism in the crypto space. For Ripple, exclusion from key policy conversations may affect its ability to contribute to the regulatory landscape, but Garlinghouse remains undeterred.

2025-05-21T09:38:16.000Z,"These Six Charts Explain Why Bitcoin's Recent Move to Over $100K May Be More Durable Than January's Run","Bitcoin BTC is trading above $100,000 again, and investors, prone to recency bias, may be quick to assume that this event will play out like it did in December-January, when the bull momentum faded, with prices quickly falling back into six figures, eventually dropping as low as $75,000. However, according to the following six charts, the bitcoin market now appears sturdier than in December-January, suggesting a higher probability of a continued move higher. Financial conditions: (DXY, 10y, 30y yields vs BTC) Financial conditions refer to various economic variables, including interest rates, inflation, credit availability, and market liquidity. These are influenced by the benchmark government bond yield, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, the dollar exchange rate and other factors. Tighter financial conditions disincentivize risk-taking in financial markets and the economy, while easier conditions have the opposite effect. As of writing, financial conditions, represented by the 10-year yield and the dollar index, appear much easier than in January, favoring a sustained move higher in BTC. At press time, the dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against major currencies, stood at 99.60, down 9% from highs above 109.00 in January. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note stood at 4.52%, down 30 basis points from the high of 4.8% in January. The 30-year yield has risen above 5%, revisiting levels seen in January, but is largely seen as positive for bitcoin and gold. More dry powder The combined market capitalization of the top two USD-pegged stablecoins, USDT and USDC, has reached a record high of $151 billion. That's nearly 9% higher than the average $139 billion in December-January, according to data source TradingView. In other words, a greater amount of dry powder is now available for potential investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bold directional bets BTC's run higher from early April lows near $75,000 is characterized by institutions predominantly taking bullish directional bets rather than arbitrage bets. That's evident by the booming inflows into the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the still subdued open interest in the CME BTC futures. According to data source Velo, the notional open interest in the CME bitcoin futures has jumped to $17 billion, the highest since Feb. 20. Still, it remains well below the December high of $22.79 billion. On the contrary, the cumulative inflows into the 11 spot ETFs now stand at a record $42.7 billion versus $39.8 billion in January, according to data source Farside Investors. No signs of speculative fervor Historically, interim and major bitcoin tops, including the December-January one, have been characterized by speculative fervour in the broader market, leading to a sharp rise in market valuations for non-serious tokens such as DOGE and SHIB. There are no such signs now, with the combined market cap of DOGE and SHIB well below their January highs. No signs of overheating The bitcoin perpetual futures market shows demand for bullish leveraged bets, understandably so, considering BTC is trading near record highs. However, the overall positioning remains light, with no signs of excess leverage build-up or bullish overheating, as evidenced by funding rates hovering well below highs seen in December. The chart shows funding rates, which refer to the cost of holding perpetual futures bets. The positive figure indicates a bias for longs and willingness among the bulls to pay shorts to keep their positions open. It's a sign of bullish market sentiment. Implied volatility suggests calm The bitcoin market appears much calmer this time, with Deribit's DVOL index, measuring the 30-day expected or implied volatility, significantly lower than levels observed in December-January and March 2024 price tops. The low IV suggests traders are not pricing in the extreme price swings or uncertainty that typically exists in an overheated market, indicating a more measured and potentially more sustainable uptrend.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/21/these-six-charts-explain-why-bitcoin-s-recent-move-to-over-usd100k-may-be-more-durable-than-january-s-run,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Stablecoins|ETFs|Bonds|DOGE|SHIB|Volatility|market analysis|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T09:33:42.000Z,"Brave becomes the first web browser to launch on-chain domain naming service for over 85m users","The web browser Brave has become the first major browser to launch its own on-chain top-level domain ‘.brave’ in partnership with Unstoppable Domains and powered by Polygon. In an official press release , the web browser announced that the new on-chain naming service would become available for more than 85 million active monthly users. The firm aims to make the domains accessible on the Brave Wallet for cryptocurrency payments and within the main browser’s newest version 1.81, which will be available in Nightly builds and scheduled for release on August 5, 2025. This makes Brave ( BAT ) the first web browser to deploy its own blockchain-based top-level domains or TLDs. Users will be able to mint their named domains as non-fungible tokens on the Polygon ( POL ) network, granting them ownership without renewal fees. The new domains offer users a seamless way to own their digital identity and simplify sending crypto by acting as a replacement to lengthy cryptocurrency wallet addresses, changing them into readable human names. According to the announcement, the domains can be resolved across various networks, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Base ( BASE ), and Sonic ( S ) to name a few. You might also like: Tokenized matchmaking? Sam Altman’s World matches up with dating app giant Match Group Holding a unique .brave domain also allows users to host decentralized websites on the InterPlanetary File System, which can be directly accessed through the browser without incurring any hosting fees. CTO and co-founder Brian Bondy, calls the browser’s first foray into on-chain TLDs as “more than a domain,” as it offers users their very own personalized identity layer that is native to the wider ecosystem. “Our mission is to put privacy, ownership, and control back in the hands of users,” said Bondy. At the moment, the web browser firm and Unstoppable Domains are exploring the possibility of gaining an ICANN general top-level domain registration for 2026. A ICANN gTLD registration would allow for .brave domains to function in both traditional Web2 and decentralized Web3 environments. As previously reported by crypto.news, the firm’s wallet recently added support for Cardano ( ADA ) after its recently announced partnership with Input | Output. The partnership aims to bring Cardano native assets to wallet users, allowing them to send, receive and swap ADA. Not only that, the web3 wallet also offers governance support for ADA holders, with capabilities directly accessible from within the browser firm’s wallet.

Gox, an exchange that went bankrupt in 2014, and create a BTC reserve. Strive stated in its application to the SEC on May 20 that it wanted to acquire Bitcoins that had received a final legal distribution decision but were still awaiting distribution, and that it had partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC for this purpose. Strive’s filing includes approximately 75,000 BTC tied to Mt.

2025-05-21T09:19:31.000Z,"Behind the hype: Is Pi Network a $70 billion ghost chain?","The Pi Coin price has remained under pressure in the past week after the much-anticipated ecosystem news event was disappointing. Pi Network coin was trading at $0.80 on Wednesday, down by 52% from the highest point this month. This article explores whether Pi is a ghost chain and the impact on price. Pi Network aimed to change the crypto industry Pi Network is a crypto project started seven years ago to solve a key problem that Bitcoin has: its cost of mining. Bitcoin mining has continued rising over the years and is now dominated by large publicly-traded companies like Mara and Riot Platforms that run huge mining farms. Pi Network became popular by creating a platform that enables anyone with a smartphone to mine the coin. Users just need to download an app and then start mining coins by just tapping a button. Pi also hoped to solve the challenge where Bitcoin lacked smart contract features, making it almost impossible for developers to build dApps on top of it. It provided developers tools to build applications in industries like e-commerce, gaming, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Pi’s goal was that its coin would be used in the physical and digital worlds, giving it utility. Also, as with other chains, Pi Network hoped that these transaction costs would be used to burn the token, reducing those in circulation and boosting its price. The presence of an ecosystem was so important that it was a precondition for the mainnet launch to happen. It had to have at least 100 mainnet-ready applications. Pi Network price chart | Source: TradingView Is Pi a ghost chain? Therefore, the question is whether Pi Network is a ghost chain or not. A ghost chain is a blockchain project that has no developers and apps in its ecosystem. It also refers to those chains with ecosystems that people don’t use. A closer look at the Pi Network ecosystem shows that there are applications in its marketplace. Maps of Pi is a search engine that shows the locations of businesses accepting the Pi Coin. Fruity Pi is a game that has become fairly popular in the ecosystem. Other apps in the network are WorkforcePool (an Upwork of Pi), MyFestMap, Pet for Pi, and ChatGPT for Pi. The challenge for Pi Network is that there are signs that developers are not building in its technology stack. Also, no mainnet-ready application has gone mainstream in the past few months. This explains why the developers launched Pi Network Ventures last week. This initiative will see the company deploying $100 million to fund startups leveraging the Pi Network ecosystem. An ecosystem fund is a good initiative that other blockchains have launched similar initiatives. Solana has a $300 million ecosystem fund, while Ethereum launched a $1.03 billion fund. Kava, Skale, Harmony, Kadena, and Velas are other chains with similar funds. The challenge for Pi Network is that the process of identifying projects to fund will take time. After that, the process of building applications will be a lengthy one. As other chains like Harmony, Kadena, and Velas have showed, it is not guaranteed that projects that receive funding will succeed. Kadena’s KDA token is now valued at $183 million, while Velas, which launched a $100 million fund is worth $11 million. Centralization problem In addition to being a ghost chain, Pi Network also faces the accusation that it is a highly centralized network. This accusation stems from the fact that it is overseen by two entities: Pi Core Team and Pi Foundation. For a project with a fully diluted valuation of over $70 billion, token holders should know more about these entities. Also, there should be a clear audit by a top auditor. Nothing is known about the Pi Core Team and the foundation, if it exists. Besides, Pi Foundation today controls over 90 billion. As such, holding Pi is giving this foundation the benefit of the doubt that it will do the right thing and not dump the tokens. There is also a risk that these addresses may be hacked, leading to substantial losses to token holders. The fact that it is a ghost chain and that it is highly centralized explains why many mainstream exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are yet to list it. It also explains why Pi Coin price has crashed. Read more: Pi Network price prediction: Will Pi Coin recover from this plunge?

If Ripple wins, it wouldn’t just gain control of a major dollar-backed asset but could instantly become one of the most dominant forces in the entire ecosystem. And not everyone’s okay with that. Critics are already throwing up antitrust red flags and warning of potential chaos if the deal goes through. Why does this acquisition matter so much? Here’s the buzz. A Disaster Is Brewing Gabriel Shapiro, founder of MetaLeX Labs, did not hold back when weighing in on the possible Ripple-Circle deal. “Making Ripple the largest asset issuer on every blockchain would obviously be disastrous and anticompetitive,” he warned, raising serious antitrust alarms. Shapiro believes that if the acquisition goes through, it won’t sail past regulators. “If a definitive agreement is signed, we will be at the DoJ’s and FTC’s doorstep, citing Ripple’s history of campaigns against Bitcoin and Ethereum…” He also pointed to Ripple’s past behavior, calling out how the firm previously used its influence to hurt competitors – like when Chris Larsen teamed up with Greenpeace in 2022 to target Bitcoin mining. According to Shapiro, Circle needs to consider the Revlon doctrine , which requires companies to act in shareholders’ best interests – including weighing antitrust risk. Oof, a well-researched lash out! Rejected Offers, XRP Leverage & a Heated Bidding War Reports suggest Ripple had initially offered around $4-$5 billion to acquire Circle earlier this year – but was turned down. Now, it’s apparently back at the table with deeper pockets, possibly combining cash and XRP reserves for a much higher bid. “Ripple is setting on holdings at about $94 billion based on estimated around $40 billion in XRP at the current price at $2.37,” said Paul Barron in a now-deleted post. But legal roadblocks still exist – Ripple can’t easily liquidate those tokens without a judge’s nod. On the other side, Coinbase holds a healthy balance sheet: around $8.5 billion in cash and nearly $2.8 billion in crypto investments. Yet despite its financial strength, it hasn’t made a move – raising questions. Circle’s Fate: Ripple, Coinbase… or a Surprise Player? While Ripple appears aggressive, Coinbase may still have the edge – especially with U.S. regulators likely to scrutinize Ripple’s bid harder. “If Coinbase wanted to buy them, Circle would sell in a heartbeat,” one banker reportedly said. And let’s not rule out a dark horse. Firms like Japan’s SBI Holdings, one of the biggest XRP holders, could jump in with support. Ripple’s acquisition push could shift stablecoin dynamics overnight. But if Shapiro’s warnings play out, this could turn into a defining moment for crypto’s future. Hopefully, a good one.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripples-circle-acquisition-would-be-disastrous-for-crypto-warns-metalexs-shapiro/,"ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T09:15:58.000Z,"These Crypto Entities Will Be the Largest Holders of US Treasuries in the World, According to Senator Hagerty","Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) says that one segment of the crypto industry will likely become the largest holders of US Treasuries. In a new interview on CNBC Television, Hagerty says stablecoin issuers will likely purchase massive amounts of US Treasuries as reserve funds to ensure the digital assets remain pegged to the dollar. Says Hagerty, “Stablecoin issuers will be the largest holders of US Treasuries in the world.” Hagerty introduced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which aims to establish federal regulations around the use of stablecoins. The bill is currently being debated by Congress. Asked what will back stablecoins, Hagerty says, “It’s not going to be equities. It’s going to be high quality short-term assets, either short-term US Treasuries or cash. I think the majority of it will be US Treasuries.” On Monday, Hagerty celebrated the bill moving closer to becoming law. “Tonight, the Senate moved forward on the GENIUS Act. This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation will bring America’s payment system into the 21st century. The GENIUS Act skyrockets the United States with a digital payment framework with the fastest rails possible. It will ensure US dollar dominance. Customers will be protected, the demand for US Treasuries will balloon to the tune of more than $1 trillion, and innovation in the digital asset space will thrive in the United States going forward. I look forward to making history with my colleagues this week.” The potential legislation would require stablecoin issuers to maintain backing for their assets on a 1:1 ratio. The bill also states that stablecoin issuer reserves can be made up of US currency; funds held as demand deposits or insured shares at an insured depository institution; and Treasury bills, notes or bonds.

In fact the further the 21-Day MA (green) gets from $100k, the less likely we are to get the support test I’ve been looking for,” he concluded. “Whether BTC retests $100k or not, I’m happy to see consolidation in this range before the next leg up.” BTC/USD 1-day chart.

2025-05-21T09:10:43.000Z,"'Days to Cover mNAV,' Emerges as The New Standard for Evaluating Bitcoin Equities","As bitcoin (BTC) continues to mature as an institutional asset, a growing number of public companies are integrating BTC into their treasuries, sparking renewed investor interest in so-called leveraged bitcoin equities (LBEs). But with valuations soaring, the key question remains: which companies are genuinely earning their premiums through consistent BTC accumulation, and which are simply coasting on reputation? A new metric, “Days to Cover mNAV,” is emerging as a sharp analytical tool to answer this. It measures how long it would take a company, at its current bitcoin stacking pace, to accumulate enough BTC to justify its market cap, based on its current multiple of net asset value (mNAV) and its daily BTC yield. The formula—Days to Cover = ln(mNAV) / ln(1 + BTC Yield)—accounts for compounding, providing a forward-looking, growth-adjusted view of a company’s valuation. The latest data points from an article by Microstrategist paints a revealing picture: Strategy (MSTR), the institutional leader, holds an mNAV of 2.1 but a low daily BTC yield of just 0.12%, resulting in a sluggish 626 days to cover its valuation. In contrast, upstarts MetaPlanet (3350) and The Blockchain Group (ALTBG) are compounding rapidly with 100-day average BTC yields near 1.5%, allowing them to support much higher mNAVs (5.08 and 9.4 respectively) in just 110 and 152 days. In addition, Semler Scientific (SMLR), with an mNAV of 1.5 and a yield of 0.33%, posts a competitive 114 Days to Cover. These figures, reinforced by the “Days to Cover mNAV” chart from October 2024 to May 2025, show a clear trend: faster accumulators are compressing their coverage times and catching up to more established players. MetaPlanet and ALTBG in particular have seen investor enthusiasm surge as they demonstrate the ability to turn BTC compounding into valuation upside. In a sector defined by speed and volatility, Days to Cover mNAV provides a clear, data-driven lens through which to evaluate long-term sustainability and upside potential.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/21/days-to-cover-mnav-the-new-standard-for-evaluating-bitcoin-equities,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET","Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|MetaPlanet|News",cryptocompare

Here’s Where the ETH Price May Reach by the End of Q2 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price is slowly rising towards the highs after it recorded one of the highest weekly closes in its history. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price surged above $2500 but has been failing to demonstrate a similar breakout, which could have elevated the levels to $2800. In times when the price appears to be trading within a bullish pattern, the on-chain formation raises some concerns over the upcoming ETH price rally. After the latest breakout from the consolidated range around $1800, the ETH price managed to rise above $2000 and even surpassed the $2500 resistance. However, the bears have been restricting the rally below $2600 for over a week, which is flashing massive bullish signals for the crypto. From a wider perspective, the ETH price seems to be trading within a bullish pattern, and hence, a breakout beyond $3200 could appear imminent. The daily chart of ETH shows a bull flag forming, and the price is heading towards the edge of the pennant. In a wider perspective, the token seems to be in the middle of a V-shaped recovery, and hence, a rise from the consolidated range could elevate the levels above $3000. Meanwhile, the volume is squeezed, and the RSI faced a pullback from the overbought zone and is stuck around the upper threshold. Moreover, the price is testing one of the sell zones, triggering a 15% pullback in February, which raises some concerns over the upcoming price action. A Rise in Open Interest Could Cause Trouble The chart patterns of Ethereum suggest the price is heading towards a breakout, while the on-chain data demonstrates disparity. The buy-take ratio has dropped below 1 despite the breakout that occurred around May 10. This suggests the bearish sentiment is still dominant, which may haunt the upcoming price action. On the other hand, the Open interest is rising but this could not be a bullish signal. Although the Open Interest (OI) is rising, it is going in line with the price. The OI is forming similar deviations as the price, which suggests the open positions could close if the price undergoes a significant drop. Hence, the volatility is subject to rise, which could keep the market participants vigilant. Therefore, the upcoming monthly close can be considered as important for the Ethereum (ETH) price rally, as a rise above the current consolidation could squash the bearish possibility, while a continued consolidation may raise the possibility of a long-short squeeze in the coming days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/is-ethereum-consolidating-ahead-of-a-mega-rally-heres-where-the-eth-price-may-reach-by-the-end-of-q2-2025/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum",cryptocompare

Cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment said in its latest post that investors are showing great interest in Bitcoin (BTC), Trump (TRUMP), AAVE, ANKR, USDC and XRP. According to Santiment's post, the cryptocurrencies that saw the biggest increase in social media conversations were listed as follows: Bitcoin (BTC): The leading crypto has surpassed $107,000 and is approaching a new ATH. Social media chatter includes BTC’s long-term investment potential, resistance to inflation, and its role as a store of value and money. TRUMP: US President Donald Trump's multiple mentions on various topics such as political statements, economic comments and international relations, such as his phone call with Vladimir Putin about the ceasefire talks, have also made TRUMP a trending topic. AAVE: The altcoin is seeing strong performance and growth in the DeFi sector as a leading on-chain lending protocol. Discussions include its significant Total Value Locked (TVL) increasing between $25 billion and $40.7 billion and a notable price increase of 15-25%. The rally is being fueled by increased trading activity, higher daily fees and $10 billion in loans. ANKR: Users are expressing mixed emotions, including frustration over unmet expectations, lack of clear communication, and team inaction. Despite this, there is recognition of ongoing development efforts, such as integration with Neura and attempts to improve token utility. USDC: Circle has been facing significant interest in a possible acquisition by Coinbase or Ripple. Ripple’s replacement of USDC with its own stablecoin RLUSD and the integration of USDC with platforms like Ethereum and Algorand also contribute to these discussions. XRP: The launch of XRP futures on CME with significant volumes, institutional interest, regulatory updates, and speculation about XRP ETFs have increased interest in XRP. *This is not investment advice.

Gox Bitcoin Claims to Boost Treasury Ahead of Reverse Merger","Strive, the investment firm founded by former U.S. presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, is positioning itself as a major Bitcoin player by acquiring distressed crypto assets, starting with claims tied to the infamous Mt. Gox exchange. In a regulatory filing submitted on May 20, Strive revealed its plan to purchase claims representing up to 75,000 Bitcoin, aiming to expand its crypto holdings at a discount. Strive Eyes Discounted Bitcoin Partnering with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC, Strive intends to target legally settled Bitcoin claims that are yet to be distributed. These claims, primarily from the defunct Mt. Gox platform, offer a unique opportunity for Strive to acquire Bitcoin well below current market prices. The firm is leveraging this strategy to boost its Bitcoin-per-share metric before completing its reverse merger with social media marketing company Asset Entities (ASST), which is anticipated to close mid-year. While Strive has yet to publicly disclose any existing Bitcoin holdings, it asserts that it will encounter fewer restrictions on acquiring Bitcoin than other firms going public via SPACs. The company emphasized that it will require shareholder approval to proceed with the Mt. Gox claim purchases. A detailed proposal outlining the terms will soon be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), followed by a proxy statement for shareholder consideration. With Mt. Gox trustee expected to finalize creditor repayments by October 31, time is of the essence for Strive to secure its position. The now-defunct Japan-based exchange was once the world’s largest Bitcoin trading platform before collapsing in 2014 following a massive security breach that resulted in the loss of around 750,000 Bitcoin. Merger Buzz Lifts Asset Entities Shares The reverse merger with Asset Entities has already sparked excitement in the market. On May 20, ASST shares surged 18.2% to $7.74, pushing its market cap to $122.1 million, according to Google Finance data. Since the merger was announced on May 7, Asset Entities’ stock has skyrocketed 1,170%. Once the deal is finalized, Strive is expected to own 94.2% of the newly combined company, with Asset Entities retaining 5.8%. The merged firm will continue operating under the ASST ticker, reflecting the company’s strategic shift toward becoming a dedicated Bitcoin treasury company. This move aligns with broader industry trends seen in firms like Twenty One Capital, which also aim to hold substantial Bitcoin reserves . The post Strive Targets Mt.

This firm isn’t just holding BTC, it’s using market hype to quietly turn investor excitement into real Bitcoin reserves. And it’s doing so with a clever formula that most people haven’t even noticed. So, what’s the actual formula & is it worth it? What is PFAR? & Why It Matters? According to renowned analyst Adam Livingston , this strategy is hiding in plain sight, and it could be the key to explosive Bitcoin gains without needing new revenue, debt, or even spending from the company’s bank account. At the center of this strategy is a powerful metric called PFAR, Premium-Funded Accretion Runway. It tells us how much Bitcoin Metaplanet could buy today using just the hype (or “premium”). Right now, Metaplanet’s market cap is about $3.53 billion, but it holds only $833 million worth of Bitcoin. That leaves a “premium” of $2.69 billion. But Metaplanet can use its premium to raise money and buy more Bitcoin without hurting its finances. How is It Profiting Metaplanet? If Metaplanet used its market premium to buy Bitcoin today at around $106,500, it could get about 25,258 BTC. That means each of its 593 million shares could be backed by 4257 more satoshis, just from the extra market hype. Right now, each share holds around 1,040 sats, so this move could boost it by almost 4.1 times without needing more revenue or taking on debt. Livingston calls this “a Satoshi singularity loop.” As the stock price rises, the premium grows. The premium buys more BTC, and the cycle repeats.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws. In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.” SEC never prohibited NFT royalties Oscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.” The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.” Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.” Source: Oscar Franklin Tan Related: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraud OpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversight While NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case. In August 2024, NFT trading platform OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC, alleging that NFTs traded on the marketplace could qualify as unregistered securities. On Feb. 22, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the SEC has officially closed its investigation into the platform. The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce , who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries. The lawyers urged the SEC to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws.” Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-royalties-not-securities-sec-peirce?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3Fpaged%3D2%26page%3D2&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ENJ|REGULATION","",cryptocompare

U.S. Bitcoin ownership by age. Source: River Shifting store of value status The shift from gold to Bitcoin significantly changes how Americans store value and build wealth. As gold’s prominence declines, Bitcoin has emerged as a mainstream investment, offering easier ownership, storage, and transactions due to its digital nature. Additionally, recent regulatory changes have made Bitcoin more accessible through financial products such as spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), further accelerating adoption. This growing adoption is further supported by favorable policies, most notably, the White House’s recent designation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. The U.S. holds 63.3% of global government Bitcoin reserves, more than double its 29.9% share of global gold reserves. China has just 4.8% of global Bitcoin reserves and 8.4% of global gold reserves. At the same time, gold’s status as a safe-haven asset remains significant, especially given its strong performance in 2025. The precious metal has seen increased capital inflows amid rising economic uncertainty driven by trade tensions. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to trade above the $100,000 mark search of a new all-time high. As of press time, the cryptocurrency was valued at $106,700, reflecting a 1.5% gain over the past 24 hours.

2025-05-21T08:30:57.000Z,"SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target?","After its breakout, SUI has been consolidating within a key range and has faced momentary resistance above the $4.00 level. Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency’s next target sits near the $5.00 mark, as it could be repeating its all-time high (ATH) rally. Related Reading: Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs SUI Party On Pause SUI has seen an impressive 120% recovery from April’s $1.76 low, reclaiming the $2.00 and $3.00 barriers in the past few weeks. The cryptocurrency has surged 85% in the last month despite its recent token unlock, rallying to a fourth-month high of $4.29 last Monday. However, SUI has retraced 10% from last week’s high, hovering between the $3.60-$4.10 price range. Trader Froggy pointed out that the cryptocurrency is approaching the significant $4.00 resistance, which it has been unable to hold for seven days. Breaking above this level “will set the stage for a strong move up,” he explained, adding, “This could be the trigger that breaks the range and opens up the next leg higher.” Meanwhile, Rekt Capital recently highlighted that SUI has built a re-accumulation range, between $3.39 and $3.78, like it did in late 2024. At the time, the cryptocurrency consolidated around this range’s upper boundary for weeks before Weekly Closing above this level and retesting it as support to confirm a breakout towards a new ATH. This time, SUI closed above the $3.78 mark two weeks ago and confirmed it as support last Sunday after closing the week at $3.94, which could suggest that a breakout to a new high is coming. SUI’s Rally To $5.00 Loading? Sjuul from AltCryptoGems considers that SUI’s consolidation is loading the cryptocurrency’s next leg up, resembling its previous performance. According to the analyst, the altcoin is consolidating within a short-term bull flag and preparing for a breakout, like it did twice in the past month. Similarly, AltCryptoTalk affirmed that SUI is “overall bullish” according to its recent all-time high (ATH) performance and advised investors not to let the recent pullback “fool” them, if it holds the $3.30 support. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency’s latest ATH breakout saw a four-stage rally, with an initial big impulse and correction, and three smaller impulses followed by corrections. Based on this, SUI is likely preparing for the second smaller impulse, as it registered a bigger breakout in late April and a smaller rally in early May. However, he warned that the smaller impulse after a bigger one is “usually a sign of weakness.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Nears Record Highs: Are We Headed For A $120,000 Breakout For its next jump, the altcoin must break through the range’s upper boundary, around the $4.00 mark, before continuing its rally. If history repeats, SUI could reach the $5.00 mark in the coming weeks, “I’m waiting for this high or a new high to be formed and then to expect another bigger bullish wave,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.84, a 2.1% increase in the daily timeframe.

2025-05-21T08:28:22.000Z,"KindlyMD shareholders approve Bitcoin pivot via Nakamoto Holdings merger","KindlyMD shareholders have approved a merger with Bitcoin holding firm Nakamoto Holdings, paving the way for the creation of a publicly traded Bitcoin-focused conglomerate. According to a May 20 announcement from the U.S.-based healthcare services provider, both companies will now file information statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The merger is expected to close 20 days after these disclosures are shared with shareholders. Completion is targeted for the third quarter of 2025. Nakamoto Holdings, led by Donald Trump’s crypto adviser David Bailey, is a newly formed entity that seeks to consolidate Bitcoin-native businesses under one umbrella. The deal gives Nakamoto Holdings a Nasdaq-listed vehicle to pursue its goal of turning Bitcoin into a foundational asset across global capital markets. The merged firm plans to scale its Bitcoin holdings per share, a concept Bailey refers to as “Bitcoin Yield,” through equity, debt, and hybrid offerings. You might also like: Bitcoin dominance hits key resistance zone: is alt-season around the corner? Though KindlyMD will continue operating its clinics focused on opioid reduction and alternative therapies, the new entity’s core focus will be financial, not medical. “We are grateful that KindlyMD shares our vision for a future in which Bitcoin is a core part of the corporate balance sheet, and investors across global capital markets have exposure to the world’s greatest asset and store of value,” Bailey said in an accompanying statement. The companies first announced the proposed merger on May 12. At the time, they described plans to launch a network of Bitcoin-native firms while using the merged balance sheet to accumulate BTC. Details of the merger were announced alongside a $710 million capital raise, with Nakamoto securing $510 million through a private placement and $200 million via convertible notes, which, according to Nakamoto, was the largest PIPE in any public crypto-linked transaction to date. Bailey, who will become CEO of the merged entity, has likened his vision to building a modern counterpart to the Rothschilds or Morgans, except with Bitcoin as the reserve asset. “Every balance sheet, public or private, will hold Bitcoin,” he said at the time. News of the merger sent shares of KindlyMD (KDLY) soaring more than 650% in premarket trading when it was first announced. Shares closed May 20 at $15.22, up 9% on the day, and climbed another 4.8% in after-hours trading. KDLY is now up over 979% year-to-date. Bitcoin’s growing role as a treasury asset With Bitcoin gaining traction as a corporate treasury asset, the KindlyMD–Nakamoto merger adds to a broader wave of public companies across the globe that have integrated Bitcoin into their financial strategies. In the healthcare space, Basel Medical Group entered exclusive talks to buy up to $1 billion worth of Bitcoin earlier this month, while Semler Scientific has also joined the trend , and has been consistently building a sizable Bitcoin stash, holding 3,808 BTC as of May 21. Meanwhile, in Latin America, Brazilian fintech Méliuz became the first publicly traded company in the region to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset, following shareholder approval earlier this month. Over in the Middle East, Al Abraaj Group kicked off its Bitcoin strategy with an initial 5 BTC purchase, while signalling plans to acquire more. Strategy—formerly MicroStrategy—was the first major public company to adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset back in 2020, effectively popularizing the corporate Bitcoin playbook. Recently, the firm disclosed a fresh $765 million purchase, adding 7,390 BTC to its balance sheet. Read more: Americans want to ditch gold reserves for Bitcoin?

2025-05-21T08:27:53.000Z,"South Korea tightens crypto rules ahead of institutional market entry","South Korea is tightening rules around digital asset transactions as it prepares to allow institutional players into its crypto market, introducing new guidelines for nonprofit crypto sales and stricter listing standards for exchanges. On May 20, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea said during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting that it had finalized sweeping new measures. Set to take effect in June, the updated rules allow both nonprofit organizations and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies, but under new compliance standards. Nonprofit entities must have at least five years of audited financial history to be permitted to receive and sell virtual asset donations. They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy. To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves. Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt. Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations. Source: FSC Related: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFs Exchange sales to be restricted Crypto exchanges will be allowed to liquidate user fees paid in crypto, but only to cover operational costs. Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount. Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest. South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing. So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds. Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors. Cointelegraph contacted South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.

Most altcoins are slightly in the green on a daily scale, as ETH has maintained the $2,500 level, while ADA is up by 2.5%. BTC New ATH Coming? It has been a highly volatile period for bitcoin, which, surprisingly, began over the weekend. After a dull Saturday in which its price traded around $103,000, the cryptocurrency started an impressive offensive on Sunday evening that was stopped at $106,000. After a brief pullback, the bulls stepped up on the gas once again and pushed BTC to a new multi-month peak of over $107,000. Another violent rejection followed , and the cryptocurrency plunged below $102,500 by the end of Monday. However, the bears couldn’t keep bitcoin down for long, and it jumped toward $107,000 on Tuesday. It couldn’t move past that level at first, but managed to do so after another brief correction. During today’s early Asian trading session, it jumped to just over $108,000 (on Bitstamp), which meant that it had come less than 1% away from a new all-time high. However, its rise was halted once again, and BTC now trades below $107,000. Its market cap has jumped to $2.120 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is close to 61%. BTCUSD.

Allegations of Mismanagement and Fraud Surface in Dual Lawsuits One of the lawsuits, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, accuses Silbert and other insiders of “recklessly” managing Genesis, claiming they engaged in fraud and self-dealing that ultimately led to the company’s collapse. The complaint alleges that Silbert and his affiliates misled creditors about the financial condition of Genesis while benefiting themselves, DCG, and associated entities such as Grayscale Investments, though Grayscale itself was not named as a defendant. The LOC is seeking to recover at least $2.2 billion in assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies for creditor distribution. A separate lawsuit filed in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York expands on these allegations. It details over $1 billion in allegedly fraudulent transfers made by DCG and insiders during a period when Genesis was reportedly facing “existential risk.” The lawsuit points to specific transactions, including $450 million across eight transfers to DCG, $297 million in crypto sent to DCG International, and $34 million in disputed tax-related payments. According to court documents, these withdrawals occurred during a time when Genesis was already insolvent, with $14 billion in outstanding loans as of late 2021. DCG Responds as Legal Disputes Raise Broader Industry Implications The filings also reference a warning issued by external consultant Oliver Wyman in November 2021, which reportedly informed DCG leadership of serious structural risks at Genesis. Despite these warnings, the lawsuits allege that no meaningful steps were taken to correct the situation. Genesis eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2023, listing over 100,000 creditors and up to $10 billion in liabilities. It completed a restructuring process in August 2023 and began distributing $4 billion in remaining assets to creditors. DCG, in response to the lawsuits, issued a statement rejecting the allegations. A spokesperson stated: These baseless lawsuits recycle the same tired, two-year old claims in an opportunistic attempt by sophisticated investors to extract additional value from DCG. We worked in good faith with a wide range of stakeholders to try to achieve a comprehensive resolution of the DCG-related aspects of the Genesis bankruptcy. We will vigorously defend ourselves against these spurious claims. These new legal developments could significantly impact the broader crypto ecosystem, particularly as DCG and its associated entities remain major players in the industry. The outcome of these lawsuits may also influence creditor recoveries and set precedents for future cases involving intercompany transfers and corporate governance failures within crypto conglomerates.

2025-05-21T07:55:58.000Z,"World’s Largest Alternative Asset Manager Discloses Modest Stake In BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF In First-Ever Crypto Bet","Blackstone, which considers itself to be the “world’s largest alternative asset manager,” has dipped its toes into crypto, purchasing shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to a May 20 filing , Blackstone bought just around $1.08 million worth of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), despite boasting approximately $1.2 trillion in assets under management. Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of IBIT at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31. The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, as per Google Finance data. This is the first time the asset manager has disclosed investing in anything crypto-related. Despite IBIT’s outstanding performance, it appears that Blackstone is not yet ready to commit substantial capital to investing in the apex crypto. It’s worth mentioning that Blackstone has largely steered clear of crypto. Back in September 2019, Blackstone co-founder and CEO Stephen Schwarzman said he liked the blockchain technology but thought its use for money was “pretty odd.” “[I was] raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,” he noted at the time. Schwarzman further admitted he wasn’t much of a fan of Bitcoin, citing difficulties understanding the technology. BlackRock On Track To Overtake Satoshi’s Bitcoin Stash BlackRock’s IBIT has drawn in a net inflow of over $46 billion since it went live on Wall Street in January 2024, signaling institutions’ persistent confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a recent post on X that BlackRock is now the second-biggest Bitcoin holder globally, trailing only the mysterious BTC inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Balchunas believes the asset manager is poised to surpass Satoshi’s holdings by next summer. The pundit reckons that if the Bitcoin price climbs to $150,000 in the coming months, it could spark a “feeding frenzy” among financial advisors, which would help BlackRock attain this milestone even more quickly.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/worlds-largest-alternative-asset-manager-discloses-modest-stake-in-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-in-first-ever-crypto-bet/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Blackrock",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T07:52:20.000Z,"Bitcoin Explosion To $500,000 Still On Track Amid Growing Sovereign BTC Exposure — Standard Chartered","Standard Chartered reiterates that the Bitcoin price is still on track to balloon to $500,000 before President Donald Trump leaves office. The British multinational bank said sovereign entities increased their indirect exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency in the first quarter by buying shares in Strategy (MSTR), noting that the trend bolsters its half-million BTC price projection. Increasing Allocations To MSTR Is Bullish For Bitcoin Roughly 12 government entities increased their exposure to MSTR in Q1, holding 31,000 Bitcoin worth of Strategy shares, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. Although investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were greenlighted in the U.S. in 2024, government entities’ increased Strategy holdings reflect “widening structural demand” for Bitcoin and Strategy’s continued use as a Bitcoin proxy, Kendrick explained. “We believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings,” he added. Government entities upped their MSTR holdings during the first quarter, with Norway’s Government Pension Fund, the Swiss National Bank, and South Korea’s pension and investment bodies each adding the equivalent of 700 BTC. Meanwhile, United States state retirement funds across California, New York, North Carolina, and Kentucky added a combined 1,000 BTC equivalent. Sweden and Liechtenstein made minor increases, while France and Saudi Arabia took first-time positions, albeit tiny, indicating growing sovereign interest in indirect BTC exposure, according to Kendrick. “The latest 13F data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports our core thesis that Bitcoin will reach the $500,000 level before Trump leaves office as it attracts a wider range of institutional buyers,” the banker opined. The latest first quarter 13F filings — reports that institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file each quarter — indicate that sovereigns’ exposure to Bitcoin via spot exchange-traded funds “was disappointing at first glance,” while increasing MSTR holdings were “very encouraging,” Standard Chartered said. The most notable ETF move came from the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which sold off its entire 3,400 BTC-equivalent stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Kendrick argued that these 13F filings are the best way to test “our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures,” pushing the price of the asset to the $500,000 milestone. “When institutions buy Bitcoin, prices tend to rise,” he summarized.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-explosion-to-500000-still-on-track-amid-growing-sovereign-btc-exposure-standard-chartered/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

He noted that NYC had sufficient experts to help New Yorkers navigate solutions through blockchain technology. Speaking at the first ever crypto summit hosted at the mayor’s official residence, Gracie Mansion, Adams asserted that NYC was “open for ‘crypto’ business” and the proposed digital assets council would be composed of industry individuals, with a chair to be confirmed in the coming weeks. Mayor Adams vows to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” We're taking the next step in becoming the Crypto Capitol of the WORLD, hosting our city's first-ever Crypto and Digital Assets Summit! Join us LIVE as we get started: https://t.co/iwO6ThkaSB — Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) May 20, 2025 Mayor Adams said at the crypto conference on Tuesday that he wanted to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” and will make policy recommendations in the coming weeks. He also pointed out that in addition to business interests, the city will explore putting birth and death records onto a blockchain to help New Yorkers’ next of kin easily access these types of documents. Adams told the inaugural NYC crypto summit on May 20 that the plan to establish the city’s crypto advisory council was not about chasing memes and trends. He added that the world is currently in the age of tokenization—which includes, blockchain, and other fintech innovations—and NYC was going to continue to move forward with it. “We want to use technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today … That means supporting the development of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive tech ecosystem. We must embrace this emerging technology and build on the success of our economy.” ~ Eric Adams, the Mayor of New York City The self-proclaimed “tech mayor” also revealed his history as a computer programmer, highlighting that he was one of the original architects of OLTPS, the precursor to COMPStat. He disclosed that he came into the tech world with a real mindset that technology could improve the lives of people, and the establishment of the crypto advisory council was part of “the evolution of that improvement.” NYC Mayor asks crypto companies to set up shop in the Empire State Mayor Adams made a pitch to crypto companies returning to the U.S. or expanding their presence in the country to set up shop in New York City. He said at a previous press briefing at Gracie Mansion that the city of New York should be looking forward to building crypto empires. Adams, who is running for reelection, reiterated his commitment to making NYC a crypto hub, telling reporters that he would work with tech and crypto companies—both big and small—to create a friendly environment to attract and help them succeed. He added that his goal remained the same as it was on day one as mayor, helping President Trump make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” Adams also claimed that New York would attract world-class talent, provide opportunities for underbanked communities, and make the government more user-friendly. He pointed out that his office was focused on the long-term value of these technologies for the city and its people. In the past, Adams was critical of Bitlicense, claiming that it stifled regulation, and he advocated scrapping it shortly after taking office as mayor in 2022. He, however, seemed to strike a more conciliatory tone towards NYDFS, saying that it was good to know that the city would have safe regulations in place for those who were investing and that there would not be any abuses.

Theta Capital Management has pulled in over $175 million for a new fund-of-funds designed to help institutional investors get exposure to early-stage blockchain startups by backing some of the industry’s top crypto venture firms. The new fund, dubbed Theta Blockchain Ventures IV, will invest in venture capital firms that specialize in crypto, Bloomberg has learned , referring to Ruud Smets, the company’s managing partner and chief investment officer. Founded in 2001, the Netherlands-based firm began focusing on cryptocurrencies in 2018 and now manages around $1.2 billion in assets. Theta has previously backed firms like Coinfund, Polychain Capital, and Castle Island Ventures. It’s still unclear though how Theta plans to allocate the newly raised capital. You might also like: Crypto VC funding: Gnosis, HQ lead with $14.95m acquisition; Perpl raises $9.25m The raise comes as crypto venture capital activity shows signs of recovery. According to a May 14 report by PitchBook, VC deal value in Q1 rose to $6 billion, more than double the $2.6 billion seen a year ago. However, the number of deals fell to 405 from 670 over the same period. PitchBook’s senior crypto analyst Robert Le said the $1.4 billion Bybit theft , which he described as the first and only “10-digit hack in history,” served as a stark reminder of the operational risks still present in the industry. He suggested the incident could drive greater institutional demand for real-time proof-of-reserve tools, improved custody systems, and middleware that simplifies key management. Le also said startups working on these areas might find a more favorable funding environment, even amid a broader reset in valuations. Despite Bitcoin hitting a record high of $100,000 in Q4 2024, venture capital activity in crypto startups remained flat , with VC deal size down nearly 90% since 2018.

2025-05-21T07:46:02.000Z,"Bitfinex Alpha | Sức Mua Thực Tế Đẩy Bitcoin Lên Đỉnh Mới","XEM FULL BÁO CÁO Tạo Tài kHoản Bitfinex Bitcoin tiếp tục thể hiện sự bền bỉ đáng kinh ngạc và sức mạnh cấu trúc bất khả chiến bại, tăng đều đặn kể từ khi lấy lại mức đáy $92,000 vào cuối tháng Tư. Cú tăng giá gần đây mang đậm dấu ấn của thị trường spot , với những pha bứt phá mạnh mẽ sau những giai đoạn ngắn gọn và rõ ràng để nghỉ xả hơi. Điều này cho thấy việc tích lũy diễn ra lành mạnh và nhu cầu tiềm ẩn rất vững chắc, thay vì bị thúc đẩy bởi các yếu tố đầu cơ thái quá. Dữ liệu Khối lượng Delta tích lũy (CVD) trên các sàn lớn vẫn giữ mức dương, khẳng định rằng những người mua thực sự — chứ không phải dân đánh đòn bẩy — đang chiếm ưu thế trong cuộc đua này. Trong khi đó, thị trường phái sinh đang ở trạng thái phản ứng , với các biến động về khối lượng mở (OI) cho thấy giai đoạn chuyển đổi, nơi các cú ép bán và thanh lý hàng loạt giúp làm sạch lớp bọt bẩn trên thị trường. Kết quả là nền tảng hiện tại trở nên sạch sẽ hơn, với đà tăng được hỗ trợ bởi dòng vốn thực chất thay vì những cơn sốt nhất thời. Với giá Bitcoin vừa điều chỉnh nhẹ sau khi đạt mức cao kỷ lục, mức chênh lệch giá (premium) thị trường giao ngay vẫn khá cao, hành động giá đi ngang hiện tại có thể chỉ đơn giản là một khoảng thời gian lấy sức trước khi bùng nổ. Mặc dù các đợt điều chỉnh nhỏ vẫn có khả năng xảy ra, xu hướng lớn vẫn đang nghiêng về phía tích cực. Mặc dù Bitcoin đang bay cao, nhưng các dấu hiệu cảnh báo tiếp tục xuất hiện trên nền kinh tế Mỹ, khi lạm phát giảm dần nhưng những rủi ro cấu trúc sâu hơn bắt đầu lộ rõ. Chỉ số giá tiêu dùng (Consumer Price Index – CPI) chỉ tăng 0.2% so với tháng trước và tăng 2.3% so với năm ngoái—mức tăng thấp nhất kể từ đầu 2021. Giá thực phẩm giảm đã giúp làm dịu bớt áp lực từ chi phí nhà ở, nhưng triển vọng vẫn còn mờ mịt do bất ổn quanh thuế quan và chính sách thương mại. Dù Mỹ và Trung Quốc đã đạt được thỏa thuận ngừng bắn tạm thời, các mức thuế nhập khẩu lớn vẫn đang tồn tại, và nhiều khả năng sẽ có thêm thuế mới vào tháng 7 tới. Những căng thẳng thương mại chưa được giải quyết này tạo ra thách thức lớn cho cả doanh nghiệp và giới hoạch định chính sách. Đồng thời, áp lực tài chính đang đè nặng lên các hộ gia đình. Số liệu từ Fed New York cho thấy tỷ lệ nợ tín dụng và vay sinh viên quá hạn trên 90 ngày đang tăng lên, vẽ nên bức tranh u ám về tình hình tài chính cá nhân. Khi tác động của thuế quan bắt đầu cắn, cùng với rủi ro lạm phát tiếp tục treo lơ lửng, sự kết hợp giữa tăng trưởng chậm và giá cả leo thang—hay còn gọi là lạm phát đình trệ (stagflation) —có thể khiến Cục Dự trữ Liên bang (Fed) rơi vào thế khó. Hiện tại, với chi phí dịch vụ lõi và nhà ở vẫn còn ở mức cao, Fed nhiều khả năng sẽ tiếp tục thận trọng. Tuy nhiên, khi áp lực kinh tế ngày càng gia tăng, những tháng tới sẽ đòi hỏi sự linh hoạt và cảnh giác cao độ. Dù thị trường có lúc chập chờn và quy định pháp lý vẫn là câu chuyện dài kỳ, việc chấp nhận Bitcoin trong giới doanh nghiệp và tổ chức vẫn đang phát triển mạnh mẽ. Quỹ đầu tư Mubadala của Abu Dhabi đã tăng cường nắm giữ cổ phần trong quỹ ETF Bitcoin spot của BlackRock (IBIT) trong quý 1/2025, thể hiện niềm tin dài hạn mặc cho giá trị thị trường của IBIT tạm thời sụt giảm. Kể từ khi ra mắt vào tháng 1/2024, IBIT đã dẫn đầu thị trường ETF spot tại Mỹ, thu hút hơn $45.5 tỷ dòng tiền chảy vào và quản lý tổng cộng $65.4 tỷ tài sản. Tại Mỹ Latinh, công ty fintech Méliuz của Brazil đã trở thành công ty đại chúng đầu tiên trong khu vực áp dụng chiến lược dự trữ Bitcoin. Sau khi mua 274.52 BTC trị giá $28.4 triệu , tổng số Bitcoin họ sở hữu giờ đã vượt 320 BTC . Động thái này nhận được sự ủng hộ mạnh mẽ từ cổ đông và khiến giá cổ phiếu công ty tăng vọt 116% , minh chứng cho sự ủng hộ của nhà đầu tư đối với chiến lược tài chính dựa trên crypto. Tuy nhiên, khung pháp lý vẫn là một trận chiến cam go. Một thẩm phán Mỹ vừa bác bỏ đề nghị chung giữa SEC (Ủy ban Chứng khoán và Giao dịch) và Ripple nhằm giảm nhẹ hình phạt và dỡ bỏ các hạn chế, viện dẫn lỗi thủ tục do vụ án đang trong quá trình kháng cáo. Quyết định này tạm thời chặn đứng một thỏa thuận tiềm năng trong vụ kiện mang tính bước ngoặt, có thể định hình tương lai của quy định crypto tại Mỹ. Tất cả những sự kiện này phản ánh cả động lực lẫn thách thức mà crypto đang đối mặt trong hành trình tiến vào hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case. In August 2024, NFT trading platform OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC, alleging that NFTs traded on the marketplace could qualify as unregistered securities. On Feb. 22, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the SEC has officially closed its investigation into the platform. The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries. The lawyers urged the SEC to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws.”Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-royalties-not-securities-sec-peirce?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T08:27:53.000Z,"South Korea tightens crypto rules ahead of institutional market entry","South Korea is tightening rules around digital asset transactions as it prepares to allow institutional players into its crypto market, introducing new guidelines for nonprofit crypto sales and stricter listing standards for exchanges.On May 20, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea said during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting that it had finalized sweeping new measures.Set to take effect in June, the updated rules allow both nonprofit organizations and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies, but under new compliance standards.Nonprofit entities must have at least five years of audited financial history to be permitted to receive and sell virtual asset donations. They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations. Source: FSCRelated: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFsExchange sales to be restrictedCrypto exchanges will be allowed to liquidate user fees paid in crypto, but only to cover operational costs. Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors.Cointelegraph contacted South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cardsSouth Korean candidates push pro-crypto agendaSouth Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, aiming to curb capital flight and bolster the country’s financial autonomy.Speaking at a recent policy forum, Lee said a won-based stablecoin could help retain domestic wealth and reduce dependence on foreign-backed digital currencies such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC).The initiative is part of Lee’s broader push for digital asset reforms, which also includes legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party, has also expressed support for introducing spot crypto ETFs, signaling bipartisan momentum on the issue.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-tightens-kyc-rules-ahead-of-institutional-crypto-entry?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC.

However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation.

They added that Fusion integrates economic alignment, network design and composability to achieve real-world outcomes.  Fusion expects traction in composer and module developmentThe Fusion team expects composers and modules — the two building blocks for the protocol — to gain traction in the next two to three years. The spokesperson told Cointelegraph that they are starting with five composers and nearly 100 modules in the first year. The team expects this to more than double over the next two to three years.“Because of how the ecosystem is designed, in two to three years we expect that the Fusion ecosystem will consist of tens of composers and hundreds of modules,” the spokesperson said. Fusion’s architecture is designed to let enterprises and Web3 builders combine technology, financial tools, and identity features in ways that were previously unavailable, the spokesperson added.“Fusion is an initiative led and funded by the Avalanche community that is only technologically possible on Avalanche,” the spokesperson said, claiming that the initiative strengthens Avalanche’s position as a blockchain that delivers real-world business value. Related: Indonesia’s DigiAsia shares pop 90% on plan to raise $100M to buy Bitcoin$100 million fund to come from existing Avalanche programsThe project is funded by resources allocated in existing Avalanche programs.

2025-05-20T12:18:57.000Z,"India’s Supreme Court urges government to regulate cryptocurrency","India’s Supreme Court has questioned the government’s lack of regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies despite imposing taxes on digital assets like Bitcoin.According to Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the growing use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies while remaining largely unregulated.“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins and is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.Kant further highlighted that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.“If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said.Related: Indian high court orders steps to block Proton MailGovernment says review may followThe Additional Solicitor General of India — a senior legal officer representing the government of India — reportedly answered the request by saying that the government “will take instructions, my lord,” indicating that the government may consider reviewing the country’s current cryptocurrency regulation.The report follows a May 5 hearing by the Supreme Court of India during which Kant and lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani shared their views on cryptocurrency. Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers. The lawyer also showed that he misunderstood the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, claiming that he was from Japan:“It was created by someone from Japan who used a fake name.”Concerns over misuseKant also expressed concern over the misuse of cryptocurrencies during the hearing. He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.”India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators.

The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy.Payjoin Developer Kit’s website. Source: Payjoin Dev KitPayjoin was first proposed by Nicolas Dorier in 2019 in Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 78. The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction.“Namely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,“ the Maelstrom announcement states.A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen’s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach:“We believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.“Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure — zkSNACKs CEOPayjoin: Soon in wallets near you?Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets.

Maelstrom’s chief investment officer and BitMEX crypto exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes said that “improving financial privacy in Bitcoin is extremely important.” He added:“The great thing about Payjoin is that if only a small amount of adoption is achieved, it breaks a key assumption used by financial surveillance companies. The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.“A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm “is keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.” The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects.Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin?Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or notHayes noted that “Payjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don’t use it.” Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily.Allen told Cointelegraph he is “building out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.” He explained that encouraging its adoption “is the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.” The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that “a key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.” “In particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,” they added.Magazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-payjoin-privacy-grant-maelstrom?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel.

2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T03:08:27.000Z,"SEC’s Crenshaw says agency playing ‘regulatory Jenga’ with crypto","The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s sole Democratic Commissioner has said the agency is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga” with its approach to the crypto industry and market regulation under the Trump administration. In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.”Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.”Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-crenshaw-agency-playing-regulatory-jenga-with-crypto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital.

This would be treated as an invalidation of the price fractal, which could open the possibility of new lows under $102,000 in the coming days.

However, crypto analyst Bluntz noted a bearish divergence on the daily chart, which could dampen BTC’s hopes for a new all-time high this week. A bearish divergence takes place when the price is forming a higher high, but the relative strength index (RSI) indicator is forming a higher low, meaning that buying pressure is beginning to fade as prices soar.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.Backlash in the courtsThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data.

2025-05-19T21:32:21.000Z,"What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinner","On May 22, US President Donald Trump is expected to host up to 220 people who had purchased the most significant quantities of his memecoin at a private event in Washington, DC.Though the exact number of attendees was unknown as of May 19, reports and blockchain data have revealed some of the tokenholders who qualified to apply for the May 22 dinner and “VIP tour” and reception, presumed to be in the White House. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22. The Democratic Party’s arm in Arlington, Virginia, announced its members would gather to oppose those in the White House “cashing in on their public office.” Cointelegraph reached out to the organization for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Buying influence, or just speculating on an emerging market?The top 220 tokenholders reportedly spent a combined $148 million to have the opportunity to attend the event, which finalized its leaderboard on May 12. However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.Bitcoin 1-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chThe annualized one-month futures premium for Bitcoin remained close to 6% despite the retest of $102,000 support. This current level is within the 5% to 10% neutral range, which has been the norm over the past week. While at first glance such data might suggest a lack of optimism, at the same time, it proves that the buying pressure is coming from the spot market rather than from leveraged bets.Japan bond spike and credit fears weigh on Bitcoin sentimentSome analysts attribute Bitcoin’s correction to comments by Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the country’s fiscal situation being “undoubtedly extremely poor,” as reported by Bloomberg. Japan 15-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China. Periods of excessive optimism usually lead to stablecoins trading above fair value, which is not a healthy indicator, as Bitcoin jumps above $105,000.USDT Tether (USDT/CNY) vs. US dollar/CNY. Source: OKXUSD Tether (USDT) has been trading at a slight 0.4% discount in China, meaning Bitcoin’s price increase has likely not been driven by FOMO. The absence of excessive leverage on Bitcoin futures and the lack of desperate inflows into Chinese markets are key ingredients for sustainable price gains, paving the way for a more solid bullish momentum above $105,000.Bitcoin shrugs off bad news, holds support amid strong spot demandBitcoin’s price displayed significant resilience after the announcement of a class-action lawsuit against Strategy’s top executives, claiming “false and/or misleading statements” regarding risks associated with Bitcoin’s investment. The complaint specifically mentions unrealized losses, although those events do not affect the company’s cash flow.Regardless of whether the case has foundation, negative headlines tend to have a much stronger and longer price impact in neutral to bearish markets, which clearly was not the case as Strategy (MSTR) shares traded up 2.4% on May 19. Additionally, the fact that the $102,000 support held amid increased global economic uncertainty, combined with strong spot buying and resilient derivatives metrics, provides every indication that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further price gains.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart.

If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support.

A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support.

A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart.

2025-05-19T18:00:15.000Z,"‘Before Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar’ — Ledn co-founder","Before discovering Bitcoin (BTC), Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo found success shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar as it rapidly lost value against the stronger US dollar. Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus. Source: CointelegraphThis was part of the motivation behind launching Ledn, a Cayman Islands-based company that gives Bitcoin holders the ability to access dollar liquidity without having to sell their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” said di Bartolomeo, adding:“This creates a bit of a virtuous cycle that we see happen time and again with real estate, with borrowing against your stock, borrowing against your gold, and so Bitcoin is no different.”Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execCrypto lending market on the riseLedn operates in a much broader crypto lending industry that has grown over the past five years due to the rapid appreciation of Bitcoin, the arrival of institutional investors and the growing utility of stablecoins.By the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto lending market was valued at $30.2 billion, a more than threefold increase compared to two years earlier, according to Galaxy Research. However, the size of the overall industry remains below the 2021 peak. The researchers attributed the recent rise to decentralized finance applications, which allow users to borrow against assets onchain. This trend was further corroborated by a recent Cointelegraph report, which documented the growing monetary value secured by DeFi lending protocols. The crypto lending market has rebounded sharply from its 2022 lows but remains well below the peak from 2021.

Together, the top three CeFi lenders — Ledn, Tether and Galaxy — account for 89% of the total market, the Galaxy report showed.

2025-05-19T17:55:05.000Z,"Ripple launches cross-border blockchain payments in UAE","Ripple, the creator of cryptocurrency XRP (XRP), launched cross-border blockchain payments in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a development that could spur the adoption of cryptocurrency in a country receptive to digital assets.Zand Bank, the UAE’s first all-digital bank, and Mamo, a fintech company that offers a digital payment platform for businesses, will be the principal users of the blockchain payments system, according to a May 19 Ripple announcement.Zand Bank and Mamo will use “Ripple Payments” to facilitate cross-border blockchain payments. Ripple Payments is a platform that combines stablecoins, cryptocurrency, and fiat to enable payments and quick settlement times, a feature of Web3 that cross-border traditional finance payment systems often lack. Ripple was licensed to offer crypto payments by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March.Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, said acquiring this license “enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, such as high fees, long settlement times, and lack of transparency, in one of the world’s largest cross-border payments hubs.”Related: Ripple, Chipper Cash partner for faster and cheaper African remittancesUAE ranked 56 out of 151 countries for crypto adoptionChainalysis, a blockchain data platform, ranked the United Arab Emirates 56th out of 151 countries for crypto adoption, according to a 2024 report. The country scored high in decentralized finance, stablecoin use, and altcoins.The UAE has made some changes that may further increase its ranking. Various emirates, including Abu Dhabi and Dubai, have attempted to establish themselves as crypto hubs.In December 2024, Tether’s USDt (USDT) became an accepted virtual asset in Abu Dhabi. In 2025, Circle’s USDC (USDC) and EURC became the first stablecoins recognized under the emirate’s crypto token regime. The country is also continuing plans to establish a digital dirham, which would be a central bank digital currency.On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced more oversight for crypto asset activities, specifically margin trading and token distribution. There will be a 30-day transition period, and affected companies will be expected to comply with the new rules by June 19. Magazine: Fake Rabby Wallet scam linked to Dubai crypto CEO and many more victims",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-launches-cross-border-blockchain-payments-uae?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
