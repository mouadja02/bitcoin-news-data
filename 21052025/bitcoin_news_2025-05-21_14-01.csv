2025-05-21T11:56:26.000Z,"HTX Celebrates Crypto Loans 2.0 Launch with Unprecedented Lending Benefits","Singapore 21 May 2025 – HTX, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, unveiled its next-generation “Crypto Loans 2.0” product on May 19. This enhanced version brings a refined structure and superior user experience, featuring multi-asset collateral, a smart dynamic Loan-to-Value (LTV) model, instant fund access, flexible repayment options, and zero fees. To mark this significant launch, HTX has rolled out two exclusive promotions: “Borrow & Earn” #7, where users can share a massive 5,000,000,000 $HTX prize pool, and the “Millions in Rewards Plus Margin Power-up” event, which provides BTC loan interest rates as low as 0.09% and an extra 10% discount on USDT loans. Unlock Multiple Benefits with HTX Loan Products To celebrate the grand launch of Crypto Loans 2.0 and commemorate the 15th anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, HTX is simultaneously launching “ Borrow & Earn” #7 and an exclusive limited-time margin promotion, delivering substantial rewards to our valued users. “Borrow & Earn” #7 runs from May 19 at 02:00 (UTC) to June 2 at 15:59 (UTC), featuring a total prize pool of 5,000,000,000 $HTX. Users simply need to borrow USDT using the Crypto Loans Flexible product during the event to earn a share of the $HTX prize pool, based on the interest paid — the more interest paid, the greater the rewards.

Concurrently, HTX has launched an exclusive margin promotion, “ Millions in Rewards Plus Margin Power-up ”, active from May 20 at 10:00 (UTC) to June 2 at 10:00 (UTC). For a single USDT loan of $1,000,000 or more, users can enjoy an extra 10% interest rate discount! This brings the annual interest rate down to as low as 3.9% (or 0.01% daily).

Leverage these ultra-low interest rates to maximize potential returns and aim for substantial gains. Optimized Borrowing Experience with Multi-Asset Collateral Loan efficiency and asset liquidity have always been two major user-focused concerns. As a key highlight of this upgrade, HTX’s “Crypto Loans 2.0” introduces a multi-asset collateral mechanism, supporting over 20 mainstream cryptocurrencies as collateral assets, including USDT, BTC, ETH, TRX, DOGE, XRP, SOL, and AVAX. This significantly boosts users’ asset utilization efficiency. To further enhance the borrowing experience, HTX has expanded its loanable assets to include SOL, TON, and USDC, with USDC also available as a collateral option. Unlike the traditional single-asset collateral model, the multi-asset collateral mechanism allows users to unlock liquidity from their holdings while effectively reducing the risk of forced liquidation due to single-asset volatility. Another standout feature of this upgrade is HTX’s limited-time offer: an ultra-low 0.09% annual interest rate for BTC Flexible Loans, with borrowing limits up to 100 BTC. This remarkable rate represents a 555-fold reduction from the previous annual rate of over 5.0%, making it an exceptional deal. For example, borrowing BTC equivalent to approximately 1,000,000 USDT would incur a mere 2.37 USDT in daily interest — a truly remarkable saving. Crypto Loans 2.0 also offers the following advantages: ● Smart Dynamic LTV Mechanism : Interest rates adjust in real time based on market conditions, ensuring industry-leading competitiveness. Annualized interest rates for Flexible Loans include 3.9% for USDT, 2.4% for ETH, and as low as 0.09% for BTC. ● Flexible Term Options : Supports flexible configuration for both flexible and fixed terms (7/30/45/90 days). ● Instant Fund Access & Flexible Repayment : Borrowed funds are delivered instantly, interest accrues every hour, and users enjoy the freedom to repay at any time, ensuring optimal fund efficiency. ● Institutional-Grade Risk Control: Supports overcollateralized loans with leverage capped under 1X and tiered liquidation to safeguard accounts. Users retain all remaining collateral assets. ● Personalized 1-on-1 VIP Service: Delivers customized loan limits, flexible currency selections, and special discounted interest rates for SVIP users. Crypto Loans 2.0 is now live! Users can access it via the HTX website by clicking “Loans” > “Crypto Loans”, or through the HTX App by tapping “More” > “Crypto Loans”.

2025-05-21T11:46:01.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – May 21, 2025","The rally shows no signs of slowing down. While overall market cap saw a slight 0.6% dip to $3.48 trillion, most of the top 100 coins have continued climbing – powered by growing institutional interest and a wave of favorable regulatory momentum. Total crypto trading volume remains strong at $123 billion, highlighting the market’s resilience and renewed investor confidence. TLDR: The crypto market continues the rally, despite the decrease in market cap; Bitcoin is in the green today, up 1.25% in 24 hours; Analysts highlight the strength of the market recovery; ‘Setting the Stage for New ATH’; Significant ETF inflows and regulatory developments fuel the rally; The rally seems sustainable, though short-term corrections and consolidations are possible. Why Is Crypto Up Today – May 21, 2025: Crypto Winners & Losers Compared to yesterday, when all the top 10 coins per market cap were green, one turned red today. Tron (TRX) fell 0.7% to the price of $0.2711. Founder Justin Sun tweeted out his support for US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, saying he’ll be attending the latter’s Gala Dinner. Cardano (ADA) is the day’s best performer. It’s up 3%, now trading at $0.7539. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated 0.8%, now changing hands at $2,553. Its daily high is $2,635. Furthermore, after briefly hitting the day’s high of $107,831, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back to the $106,500 level. Over the past day, it increased by 1.4%, trading at $106,533. Notably, this is its yesterday’s high, which it finally managed to hold. Also, the majority of the top 100 coins saw their prices increase. The highest gainer in this category is Stacks (STX) , having increased by 7.1% to $0.9106. Story (IP) fell the most among the red coins. It’s down 3.7% to $4.49 Overall, the crypto market rally continues to be fueled by the increase in institutional adoption, surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows, regulatory shifts, and ongoing macroeconomic relief following the easing of trade tensions. In turn, this has fueled risk-on sentiment. Furthermore, the regulation is currently favorable for crypto. All eyes are at the moment primarily on the US. The country’s Senate has voted to advance the GENIUS Act , which would regulate stablecoins at the federal level. The Senate advanced the GENIUS Act with a 66-32 bipartisan vote on Monday, marking a big step toward establishing federal regulation for stablecoins and digital currency oversight. #GENIUSAct #Stablecoins https://t.co/JmoPuWjKdf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins faced questions from lawmakers on 20 May. They focused on the regulator’s handling of the fraud case involving Tron founder Justin Sun and a Donald Trump-linked meme coin. It remains to be seen if this will have a more pronounced impact on the market. Chairman Paul Atkins will testify before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government today at 10 a.m. ET. A livestream will be available: https://t.co/QDPSVDHlCR — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 20, 2025 ‘Setting the Stage for New ATH’ According to the latest Glassnode report, BTC has hit a local high of $107,000, moving close to its all-time high of $109,000. This has led to a significant increase in capital inflows. It has pushed the Realized Cap above $900 billion, “for the first time, a historic milestone.” Only four trading days in history have recorded a higher daily closing price. The last weekly close of $106,500 was the highest ever. The coin is trading some 40% higher over the last six weeks, “highlighting how strong the market recovery has been,” the analysts say. Source: Glassnode Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler , has commented that BTC may have entered a consolidation phase, marked by accumulation. The current price action could be “setting the stage for another leg higher that could lead to a new all-time high.” He commented that the $90,000–$110,000 range is a key consolidation zone, as BTC has spent significant time within this range since November. “This suggests a high concentration of trading activity and order volume, which could reinforce the area as a strong support level. If this dynamic continues, Bitcoin will likely remain anchored in this range, even following the renewal of all-time highs, as it serves as a psychologically and technically important price corridor.” Lienkha noted the existing risk of a downside correction but added that the chances are “relatively low in the short to medium term.” While it’s too early to declare the beginning of a full-scale altseason, the executive says, Ethereum has seen notable outperformance. This is the result of internal factors, including the Pectra upgrade and the expansion of stablecoins on the network, supported by a favorable macroeconomic environment. Levels & Events to Watch Next After two days of unsuccessful attempts, BTC finally managed to break through the $106,000 level, rising above $106,500. More importantly, at the time of writing, it is holding that level. This shows how today’s brief high can become tomorrow’s price in the market’s push-and-pullback game. The coin couldn’t sustain the day’s high of $107,800. However, if it manages to surpass $107,000 and stay there, the next level to keep an eye on will be $108,786, after which it will likely be testing fresh all-time highs. Per Glassnode, the $2,400–$2,900 range is a crucial zone for Ethereum. This is both a resistance zone and a potential breakout level, “essential for maintaining upward momentum.” Source: Glassnode Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has recorded a slight increase since this time yesterday, from 68 to 69, going deeper into the greed territory. As previously noted, this signals investor optimism, confidence, and willingness to take risks as a result of higher prices and trading volumes. That said, it can also lead to overconfidence and overvaluation, which typically precede a correction. Notably, the market continues to be fueled by significant investor interest and exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflows. On May 20, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of $329.02 million . This is its fifth consecutive day of inflows. The cumulative total net inflow reached $42.77 billion. Also, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $64.89m in net inflows, for a third day of positive flows, resulting in the cumulative inflow of $2.59 billion. Additionally, major alternative asset manager Blackstone invested in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) , thus entering the crypto space via an ETF. According to the 20 May filing, as of 31 March, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares, 9,889 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) , and 4,300 shares of the ATM operator Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM) . According to a recent portfolio filing, Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund disclosed holding 23,094 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of March 31. This marks the first time Blackstone has publicly reported a bitcoin-related position. https://t.co/EVhkd04vnw — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 20, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? While crypto has maintained its bull run, stocks went the other way under pressure from rising Treasury yields, ending six consecutive sessions of gains. The S&P 500 is down 0.39%, the Nasdaq-100 fell 0.37%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a decrease of 0.27%. With the rising concerns over inflation and interest rate hikes, investors seek refuge elsewhere. The stocks are pushed down by Trump’s efforts to pass a tax-cut bill that could add $3 trillion-$5 trillion to the government’s debt of $36.2 trillion. Is this rally sustainable? The rally seems strong. It is encouraged by strong fundamentals, primarily institutional demand, significant regulatory developments, and macroeconomic tailwinds. That said, there may be a potential regulatory shift ahead, as well as growing greed that could signal short-term corrections. Alternatively, the market could be seeing a consolidation period.

2025-05-21T11:45:42.000Z,"Arthur Hayes Gives Portfolio Update, Says ‘Nasty Correction’ Could Be Approaching This Year for Crypto","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is offering an update on the current holdings of his family office Maelstrom Fund. In a new interview on the Bankless YouTube channel, Hayes says the crypto portfolio of his family office is dominated by the two largest crypto assets by market cap. “Maelstrom [Fund] is about like 60% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum. And then a lot of other shitcoins, term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it’s physical gold and gold miners. And treasury bills. That’s it.” Over the coming weeks, the BitMEX co-founder says Bitcoin ( BTC ) could appreciate by up to 138% from the current level before 2026. “I think we’re going to go on a run to like in the $150,000 to $200,000 range between now and sort of like maybe sometime in the summer. We will get some nasty correction and then I think we go to $250,000 on Bitcoin by the end of the year.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,070 at time of writing. On his price targets for Ethereum ( ETH ), Hayes says, “Ethereum… I think if we can get to $5,000 by the end of the year, I will probably be good. That will sort of reinvigorate people and maybe you know ETH gets to $10,000 or $20,000 by the end of the run. But I think that there’s a hard slog between here and $5,000 for ETH.” Ethereum is trading at $2,513 at time of writing. The BitMEX co-founder further says altcoins will also experience a bullish run. “There will be an alt season. It might not be the alts that you own. It might not be the overvalued venture capital high-FDV [fully diluted valuation] low-float piece of shitcoin with no clients coin that you own. But there will be new narratives, there always will be. There will be a new hot thing that everybody’s slinging on the decentralized exchanges.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The leading cryptocurrency just broke out of a strong bullish pattern, and traders are now eyeing the $116,000 mark as the next big target. With strong momentum building and multi-month charts showing no bearish signals, many believe a new all-time high could be right around the corner. But amid the excitement, some experts are sounding the alarm on what could come next. Could Bitcoin Crash to $2,000? While Bitcoin’s short-term outlook looks bullish, one analyst has warned of a massive correction once the rally peaks. Some even call it a “mathematical certainty” that Bitcoin could tumble to as low as $2,000–$3,000 in the future. The long-term provisional target remains at $140,000. According to technical wave counts, Bitcoin could break its all-time high soon, fueling further gains. However, it’s crucial for traders to follow the correct wave structure, as many misinterpret ongoing movements. Post $140K, while some might expect an immediate peak, analysts suggest there’s still more room for growth before Bitcoin enters a major correction phase. Ultimately, though, Bitcoin is expected to undergo a supercycle correction back down to $3,000–$2,000 once the top is in — a cycle seen repeatedly in its history. Macro Risks and Market Warnings Adding to the uncertainty, the U.S. Dollar Index is weakening and could slide further, which often helps risk assets like Bitcoin. However, broader economic issues — like the recent U.S. credit downgrade and rising bond yields — might create new challenges for crypto markets. There’s also speculation that the Federal Reserve may step in with emergency liquidity measures if financial markets get shaky again, adding more volatility to Bitcoin’s path. Markets To Be Less Volatile This Time? Bitcoin still moves closely with risky assets like stocks, so it will take time before it truly moves on its own. This cycle, the leverage in Bitcoin is low compared to the 2021 peak, which could mean less wild price swings. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe says Bitcoin is heading to new all-time highs faster than expected. He sees $120K, $150K, and even $200K as imminent as more and more people are frustrated with the dollar’s ongoing devaluation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-hits-108k-just-2-from-ath-but-could-it-really-crash-to-2000/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T11:35:13.000Z,"Bitcoin Maxis Trying To Stop What’s Coming for Ripple and XRP: Pundit","The feud between Bitcoin maximalists and XRP supporters has erupted into a full-blown ideological clash, driven by Ripple’s bold foray into the stablecoin market and an eyebrow-raising political slight. At the center of this intensifying drama is the recent cancellation of a scheduled meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and a U.S. senator —a move many in the crypto space view as a deliberate attempt to stifle Ripple’s growing influence. This incident, amplified by viral commentary from crypto analyst The Real Remi Relief on X, has been interpreted as a coordinated attempt by Bitcoin Maxis to block what’s coming for Ripple and XRP. As Ripple charts a new course with game-changing acquisitions and stablecoin initiatives, the tension between camps has reached a boiling point, revealing a high-stakes battle for control over the future of digital finance. Political Snub Fuels Tensions Between Ripple and Bitcoin Maxis According to reports from TimesTabloid , Brad Garlinghouse had been slated to meet with U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis to discuss Ripple’s regulatory roadmap and its role in the evolving crypto landscape. However, the meeting was canceled at the last minute, without any attempt to reschedule. The decision triggered outrage within the XRP community , with many interpreting the move as politically motivated. According to The Real Remi Relief, the incident was more than just a scheduling conflict—it was a coordinated effort by Bitcoin maximalists to suppress Ripple’s growing political capital. “The BTC Maxis are trying to stop what’s coming for Ripple & XRP,” he posted on X, asserting that the senator’s actions were influenced by forces who feel threatened by Ripple’s accelerating momentum. The BTC Maxis are trying to stop what’s coming for Ripple & XRP… This is what’s happening behind closed doors… 1) Ripple is buying Circle USDC 2) USAGov will be using RLUSD & USDC 3) BTC maxis are trying to stall/stop the genius act because once that happens XRP will be… pic.twitter.com/Fn05PRNxAk — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 19, 2025 Ripple’s Attempted Acquisition of Circle Adding fuel to the fire, Ripple has been making aggressive moves behind the scenes to bolster its stablecoin position. Timestabloid recently reported that Ripple had made a multi-billion-dollar acquisition offer to Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Initial reports indicated an offer in the $4 billion to $5 billion range, which Circle rejected, deeming it far below its valuation, especially ahead of its anticipated IPO. Undeterred, Ripple reportedly increased its bid to a staggering $20 billion, highlighting the company’s ambition to not only lead in cross-border payments but also dominate the stablecoin market. This level of investment shows Ripple’s intent to become a central pillar in the future of global digital finance—an outcome that Bitcoin Maxis are reportedly desperate to stop. Potential Adoption of Stablecoins Even as negotiations with Circle continued, Ripple had already laid the groundwork for its stablecoin, RLUSD , which launched in December 2024. Backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash reserves, RLUSD is a fully-regulated, USD-pegged stablecoin designed for real-world utility and interoperability. The token operates natively on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, and it’s engineered for enterprise-grade liquidity, on-chain payments, and tokenization. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s strategy is clear: establish a regulatory-compliant, technologically robust stablecoin that can rival USDC and pave the way for adoption by government and financial institutions. With talk of the U.S. government exploring RLUSD and USDC for official digital payment channels, Ripple appears to be positioning itself at the heart of a new digital financial order. A Threat to the Crypto Status Quo For Bitcoin maximalists, these moves represent more than just business competition—they threaten the very foundations of their belief system. Maxis advocate for Bitcoin as the only legitimate digital asset, and they often deride other projects as centralized or inferior. Ripple, with its deep institutional ties and regulatory outreach, has long been a target of such criticism. But now, with real political traction and a potentially dominant position in stablecoins, Ripple poses an existential threat to Bitcoin’s supremacy. The canceled Senate meeting has thus become a flashpoint in this ideological war. To XRP supporters, it represents an act of obstruction by those threatened by Ripple’s progress. To others, it’s a sign that the corridors of power are not yet ready to embrace the transformative shift Ripple is advocating. Either way, the friction is undeniable. The Inevitable Shift: XRP’s Path to the Top Despite the resistance, momentum appears to be on Ripple’s side. With RLUSD live , major acquisition bids in play, and whispers of U.S. government alignment, XRP’s ascent seems not only possible but increasingly probable. As The Real Remi Relief put it, “Nobody can stop what’s coming.” Whether Ripple ultimately overtakes Ethereum or even challenges Bitcoin remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the crypto landscape is evolving fast, and Ripple is at the helm of that transformation. If XRP does rise to the top, it will be because of strategic foresight, regulatory persistence, and its ability to build in the face of opposition, not despite the obstacles, but because of them.

2025-05-21T11:30:00.000Z,"SEC and NYC Signal Strategic Embrace of Blockchain Technology","In a pivotal week for US crypto policy, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins and New York City Mayor Eric Adams outlined major new initiatives aimed at integrating blockchain technology and digital assets into both federal regulation and urban innovation. Atkins, testifying in one of his first public hearings since taking office, reaffirmed his commitment to prioritizing digital asset oversight, while Adams announced the formation of a Digital Advisory Council to attract investment and make New York the world’s leading crypto hub. New York City Aims to Become Global Crypto Capital with New Digital Advisory Council New York City Mayor Eric Adams is pushing forward with his long-standing digital asset agenda, announcing on Monday the formation of a new Digital Advisory Council aimed at establishing the city as the “crypto capital of the globe.” Speaking at the inaugural New York City Crypto Summit on May 20, Adams emphasized the importance of integrating blockchain technology into civic life, not as a passing trend, but as a foundational shift for New York’s digital future. While specific details remain under wraps, Adams said the council would be composed of local experts and fintech leaders, with a council chair and formal policy recommendations expected in the coming weeks. Mayor Adams made it clear that this initiative is about more than branding. He envisions blockchain technology playing a direct role in city governance and public services. One of the proposals under consideration is enabling New Yorkers to pay for certain municipal services and taxes using cryptocurrencies, a move that would align the city with broader state-level legislative efforts already underway. Adams also floated the idea of using blockchain to safeguard sensitive documentation, such as birth and death certificates, in a secure yet accessible format. This latest push follows a May 12 announcement that financial services company Figure and private equity firms Traction and Scale would assist in the city’s broader blockchain adoption efforts. These firms bring fintech, tokenization, and asset management experience to the table, suggesting the advisory council may focus on more than just payments and records. It may also evaluate tokenized infrastructure, digital identity, and blockchain-based capital formation strategies. The mayor’s commitment to crypto and Web3 initiatives isn’t new. Since taking office in January 2022, Adams has consistently promoted the city’s adoption of digital assets—famously opting to receive his first three paychecks in Bitcoin as a gesture of support. State-Level Momentum but Limited Progress While Adams takes the initiative on the city level, several New York State legislators have also attempted to advance digital asset policy statewide. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill allowing state agencies to accept crypto payments. Earlier, in February, State Senator James Sanders Jr. proposed the Blockchain Study Act, aimed at forming a task force to assess the state’s blockchain landscape. However, both bills remain in legislative limbo and have yet to advance through either the state Senate or Assembly. These developments come amid a broader trend of US states positioning themselves for the crypto economy. At least 18 states are considering proposals to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, and New Hampshire and Arizona have already passed related legislation, according to data from Bitcoin Reserve Monitor. States pushing for Bitcoin reserves (Source: Bitcoin Reserve Monitor ) Mayor Adams' commitment to crypto faced scrutiny after he was indicted on corruption charges tied to alleged illegal campaign contributions from the Turkish government. However, in a surprising turn of events, the US Justice Department directed local authorities to drop the charges, and the case was formally dismissed with prejudice on April 2. Despite the controversy, Adams has used the clearing of his name as a springboard to reassert his policy platform, which he says is centered on economic inclusion, technological equity, and digital transformation. Crypto Summit Marks Turning Point The New York City Crypto Summit, where Adams made his announcement, marks the city’s most formal step toward integrating the crypto industry into its public and economic systems. The summit included representatives from fintech startups, blockchain developers, venture capital firms, and policymakers, signaling a concerted effort to position the city competitively against other global crypto hubs like Dubai, Singapore, and London. With new collaborations, a policy council in motion, and continued legislative efforts at the state level, New York City is setting the stage to reclaim its tech dominance. The crypto industry, long skeptical of New York’s historically strict regulations, may find renewed optimism in Adams’ approach, which blends regulatory realism with a pro-innovation stance. The next steps include finalizing the Digital Advisory Council’s structure and releasing policy recommendations—expected before the end of Q2 2025. In parallel, pilot programs for blockchain-based document security and crypto tax payment systems are reportedly under internal review. Whether these plans will translate into meaningful infrastructure, and actual adoption, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: New York is back in the conversation, and this time, it’s speaking the language of tokenization. New SEC Chair Paul Atkins Pledges Crypto Reform as GENIUS Act Gains Momentum In related news, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins appeared before lawmakers on May 20 in a highly anticipated congressional oversight hearing, making his position clear: the future of digital asset regulation will be one of his top priorities. Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee, Atkins addressed a slew of questions ranging from regulatory funding transparency to interagency collaboration. While measured in tone, his remarks confirmed that the SEC is preparing to pivot away from the enforcement-heavy stance of past leadership and toward a more structured, collaborative framework for regulating cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Paul Atkins at a May 20 SEC oversight hearing (Source: House Appropriations Committee ) A New Tone at the Top Atkins’ appointment in April, under the nomination of President Donald Trump, was widely seen as a turning point for US digital asset regulation. A former SEC commissioner himself, Atkins brings both institutional credibility and industry-friendly leanings to the role. His early actions have signaled an effort to realign the SEC’s approach to crypto with market realities and innovation imperatives. This hearing marked his first major public appearance since assuming the role and came just a day after the US Senate moved forward on a vote to consider the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act)—a landmark piece of legislation that could redefine stablecoin oversight. Lawmakers pressed Atkins on the status of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, helmed by Commissioner Hester Peirce, and sought specifics on its budget, timeline, and objectives. Representative Chuck Edwards (R-NC) asked directly how much funding had been allocated to the task force, a question Atkins declined to answer directly, saying only that the findings were “still under development.” Though vague on numbers, Atkins confirmed the task force’s first formal report is expected within the coming months. This report, he hinted, will lay the groundwork for clearer guidance on token classification, disclosures, custody frameworks, and potentially even DeFi-specific protocols. Upcoming June Roundtable Signals DeFi Focus The SEC is also organizing a series of roundtable discussions with commissioners and private sector leaders, the next of which is scheduled for June 9 and will focus specifically on decentralized finance (DeFi). These forums are expected to influence the Commission’s internal rulemaking discussions and could set the stage for tailored regulation that distinguishes DeFi from centralized crypto platforms. Sources close to the SEC suggest that these roundtables are part of a broader strategy to rehabilitate the agency’s relationship with the digital asset sector, which has long criticized the SEC for pursuing regulation through enforcement rather than engagement. Atkins' remarks coincided with major movement in the US Senate on the GENIUS Act, which aims to create a national framework for stablecoin issuance, reserve audits, and regulatory jurisdiction. Under the act, stablecoin oversight would be clarified and shared between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), with the Federal Reserve overseeing reserve asset integrity. The bill is part of a wave of crypto-related legislation currently under discussion in Congress, including proposals for tax deferrals on digital asset transactions, definitions for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and digital identity protection using blockchain technology. Atkins signaled alignment with the GENIUS Act's objectives, suggesting the SEC would welcome legislative clarity that delineates its role in overseeing specific digital asset classes, particularly stablecoins and security tokens. From SEC Limbo to Regulatory Momentum Atkins’ prior statements have been critical of the regulatory vacuum that the crypto market has found itself in under past administrations. Now, with increasing alignment between legislative efforts and SEC reform, the prospect of a more stable and transparent regulatory framework for US crypto markets is closer than ever. Industry groups including the Blockchain Association, Coin Center, and Crypto Council for Innovation have cautiously welcomed Atkins' leadership, noting his willingness to engage constructively with both innovators and lawmakers.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9210/sec-and-nyc-signal-strategic-embrace-of-blockchain-technology,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T11:27:20.000Z,"Bears Keep Litecoin and Quant Prices Under $100—Will They Spark a Breakout in May?","The post Bears Keep Litecoin and Quant Prices Under $100—Will They Spark a Breakout in May? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price surged above $107,000 for the second time in the past few days, which has raised confidence, making users optimistic. Interestingly, the Bitcoin dominance experienced a small pullback, which suggests a shift in the investor’s attention away from the star token towards the other altcoins. Meanwhile, the popular ones are failing to rise above their respective resistance as Ethereum remains stuck below $2600 and the prices of Litecoin & Quant continue to accumulate below $100. Now the question arises whether an ETH price breakout is required to lift the LTC & QNT price above $100 or a major price action is fast approaching. Litecoin (LTC) Price Feared for Another Drop The Litecoin price had broken above the prolonged consolidated range in the first few weeks, but the momentum faded as the token reached the end of Q1. Although the bulls are working hard to validate a V-shaped recovery, the bears are successfully dragging the levels below $100 and have kept the price restricted within the range. The current chart pattern could appear bullish, but in the wider timeframe, the LTC price appears to be primed for a major pullback. The LTC price has remained stuck within a rising parallel channel for over a few years, after triggering a rebound from the 2022 bear market. The token has been trying to breach above the average band of the channel for over a couple of weeks, but the bearish start for the week flashes bearish signals. The 50/200-day MA is failing to initiate a Golden cross while the DMI is heading towards a bearish crossover. Therefore, the Litecoin price is feared to drop back close to $75 if the token fails to trigger a rebound. Quant (QNT) Price in a Decisive Phase Quant has maintained a horizontal consolidation after surging by over 60%. The consolidation has been flashing the weakness of the bulls, which may point towards an extended pullback. The QNT price is trading within a decisive phase, and hence, a breakout could elevate the price beyond current highs. While the volume remains within a restrictive range, it would be interesting to watch whether the price will rise to $111 or drop close to $80. As seen in the above chart, the Quant price is about to experience a rise in volatility as the Bollinger bands are about to contract. On the other hand, the Chaikin Money Flow is heading towards the average range, hinting towards a drop in the money flow. This suggests the token is likely to accumulate for some more time, followed by which a major price action could follow, depending on the volume induced. Considering the current price action, breaching above $100 seems to be quite difficult for the prices of Litecoin and Quant. However, with a rise in the buying volume, the market sentiments could change, which could clear the barriers to rise above the 3-digit figure.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bears-keep-litecoin-and-quant-prices-under-100-will-they-spark-a-breakout-in-may/,"BTC|LTC|MARKET|TRADING|QNT","Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Here Are the Details…","Russia is making new regulations, approaching Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies in the face of sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's Justice Ministry has prepared a draft law that would classify Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as property subject to seizure, local news agency Tass reported. This bill facilitates the seizure and subsequent confiscation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and classifies them as property. The draft law was first introduced by Russian Deputy Justice Minister Vadim Fedorov, who attended the St. Petersburg International Law Forum (SPILF). Fedorov explained that this bill will determine the necessary procedures and considerations to facilitate and accelerate the confiscation of BTC and cryptocurrencies. “The Department of Justice has prepared a bill that would classify digital currencies as property for purposes of seizure and subsequent forfeiture. This bill will speed up the seizure and confiscation of digital assets. Because digital assets cannot be physically seized and placed in a safe, as is the case with cash and valuables. This made their transactions difficult.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Russia Prepares New Bill for Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins!

2025-05-21T11:15:00.000Z,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Eyes New High as MetaPlanet Mania Builds","By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) bulls still seem to be in control. The largest cryptocurrency posted a record-high daily close on Tuesday, at $106,830, as it extends its strong upward momentum with minimal pullbacks, putting the previous all-time high of just over $109,000 from Jan. 20 well within reach. This price action has significantly boosted bitcoin-leveraged equities, with Japan’s MetaPlanet (3350) standing out—its stock has surged 160% in 2025 alone. Strategy (MSTR), the poster boy for bitcoin buying, has added 44%. MetaPlanet has repeatedly hit Japan’s daily limit-up threshold within minutes of market open, effectively freezing upward trading for the day and fueling what resembles a slow-motion short squeeze. Speculation around MetaPlanet’s aggressive bitcoin accumulation, as indicated by metrics like Days to Cover mNAV , is driving investor frenzy. Still, CEO Simon Gerovich recently posted on X that MetaPlanet is now the most shorted stock in Japan, with 25% of outstanding shares held short. Meanwhile, macroeconomic conditions add to the complexity. Japanese bond yields are spiking, with the 30-year yield climbing above 3.1% and the 10-year surpassing 1.5% — the highest since 2008. In the U.K., inflation unexpectedly climbed to a 15-month high , pushing the 10-year gilt yield toward the critical 5% level. With bitcoin nearing new highs amid rising global yields and persistent inflationary pressures, markets are entering a phase of heightened volatility that demands keen attention. Stay alert!

On her Talk Tuah podcast, Welch said she was questioned by the FBI, gave her phone to the SEC, and was “cleared” of wrongdoing, claiming she was an unwitting participant. Welch now says she didn’t understand crypto and felt “sick” that fans trusted her, contrasting her November 2024 enthusiasm, when she claimed to have “learned so much” about the token. HAWK, launched on Solana, reached a $491 million market cap before crashing below $100 million within hours. It’s now at $104,000, down 99% from its peak. Welch claimed user losses were $180,000, much lower than the estimated $1.2 million. Her figure excludes 10,149 token holders who never sold, per Solscan. Commentators criticized Welch for endorsing a project she didn’t understand, with YouTube comments highlighting her lack of accountability. Welch’s team previously stated the project was legally compliant with a Cayman foundation and that her tokens would vest over three years.

Here’s Why! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is getting close to its all-time high price — just 4% away from hitting $110,000. As of now, it’s trading around $106,183 with a market cap hitting $2.11 trillion. And now, many people in the crypto world are asking, can Bitcoin hit a new record in the next 24 hours? Let’s find out. Bitcoin Inches Closer to ATH Price Bitcoin has already begun to show strong momentum. After falling below $75,000 in April due to global market pressure, it has bounced back with force, up 22% over the past month. Recently, it even tested the $107,000 level. Now, all eyes are on whether it can push through to the $110,000 mark. According to market watchers, this surge mirrors the early 2021 setup, right before the last major bull run. And there’s data backing this momentum. Daily Price Swings Support the Possibility One important number to watch is Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility , which shows how much the price might move. Right now, it suggests Bitcoin can go up or down by about 2.5% in a day. Based on today’s price, that means it could reach around $109,123, which is very close to its highest price ever. So yes, Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high today. Institutions Are Buying Massively Investor interest is booming. U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in nearly $6.9 billion in just three weeks. Big companies are buying too, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) added 7,390 BTC, and Japan’s Metaplanet recently bought 1,004 BTC. On top of that, Bitcoin futures open interest has hit a record high of $75 billion, showing that traders are betting big on price growth. Top Analysts Say “Yes” Crypto experts are feeling positive, too. Well-known analysts like Ali Martinez say Bitcoin might soon go above $107,593, which could push the price up to $111,500. Others, like Michael van de Poppe , say a new ATH is not just possible — it’s likely to happen sooner than expected.

Crypto Council to Guide NYC’s Digital Strategy Though specific names and functions of the advisory council have yet to be disclosed, Adams said a chairperson and initial policy recommendations will be announced in the coming weeks. The council will include experts from financial technology, blockchain, and public policy sectors, tasked with helping the city navigate and implement forward-thinking crypto strategies. Earlier this month, Adams also revealed that financial services firm Figure and private equity groups Traction and Scale will assist in shaping the city’s crypto roadmap. Among their goals: exploring crypto payments for municipal services and leveraging blockchain for secure management of sensitive documents such as birth and death records. “Bringing blockchain security capabilities to the city means that birth certificates and death records can remain private but accessible to New Yorkers and their next of kin,” Adams explained. “We want to bring jobs of the future to our city today.” Statewide Legislation Lags Behind City’s Vision While Adams pushes forward, state lawmakers are also working to catch up. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill that would allow New York State agencies to accept crypto as payment . However, it has yet to reach the state’s full House or Senate for a vote. Meanwhile, the Blockchain Study Act—introduced by Senator James Sanders Jr. in February—seeks to form a state crypto task force. That bill too remains in early stages. Adams, who made digital assets a centerpiece of his mayoral campaign in 2022 and famously accepted his first three paychecks in Bitcoin, continues to advocate for integrating crypto into city governance. Although he faced a corruption investigation tied to alleged foreign donations, the case was dismissed with prejudice on April 2. Across the U.S., momentum is building. At least 18 states are considering legislation to create strategic Bitcoin reserves, with New Hampshire and Arizona already approving such measures .

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana’s TVL crossed $10.9 billion, influenced by fee growth, increased staking, and rising DeFi use cases.

On the other hand, the open interest against the price is at $6.9 billion. These strong on-chain metrics could play a pivotal role in pushing the SOL price to greater highs. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-05-21T11:02:50.000Z,"Printer exploit reveals new threat to cryptocurrency wallets","MistTrack recently revealed a new threat in the crypto space that steals funds from users’ wallets that comes in the form of a hijacking exploit found within a printer driver. In a recent post , the cybersecurity arm of SlowMist raised awareness regarding a fairly new, yet hard to detect, threat entering the crypto space. Through an installed printer driver, a malicious backdoor program is able to hijack users’ clipboard and replace their copied crypto wallet address with that of the attacker’s. “The official driver provided by this printer carries a backdoor program. It will hijack the wallet address in the user’s clipboard and replace it with the attacker’s address,” wrote the web3 cybersecurity platform. According to on-chain data from MistTrack, the attacker has stolen at least 9.3086 Bitcoin ( BTC ) from dozens of on-chain addresses. Based on current prices, the stolen funds amount to nearly $1 million or around $989,383. The crypto wallet address has been active since April 22, 2016. Before its recent activities, its last detected on-chain transaction was in March 14, 2024 and is linked to multiple crypto exchanges. You might also like: Frankfurt authorities seize $38.2m from eXch due to money laundering allegations How does the exploit work? Cases of hidden malware exploits, like the one highlighted by MistTrack, occur as a result of attackers distributing malicious code through programs that need to be installed into the user’s hardware, such as a laptop, computer or mobile device. In this case, the attacker inserted the backdoor program through a printer driver that appears legitimate. Once installed, the driver monitors the user’s clipboard—the temporary storage area where copied data is held— in search of a cryptocurrency wallet addresses. If the user copies what appears to be a crypto wallet address in order to send funds, the malware instead replaces it with the attacker’s crypto wallet address. When the user pastes what it believes to be the original crypto wallet address from the clipboard and they fail to notice the hijacked change, the funds are then sent to the attacker’s wallet instead of the intended recipient. A similar exploit was highlighted by CyberArk back in March 2025, which involved a malware called MassJacker. The malware enabled the attacker to access the user’s clipboard to alter the original crypto wallet address and redirect cryptocurrency transactions to attacker-controlled wallets, effectively stealing funds from the victim’s wallet. Unlike the printer driver exploit, MassJacker used more than 750,000 unique addresses instead of a recurring one. The malware was able to infiltrate user’s hardware through pirated and cracked software downloaded from unofficial websites.

2025-05-21T10:48:26.000Z,"Brave Becomes First Browser to Launch Blockchain Domain With “.brave”","Key Takeaways: Brave is the first browser to launch its own blockchain-based domain with “.brave”. The domains are minted as NFTs on Polygon and support decentralized websites via IPFS. Plans are underway to register .brave with ICANN to bridge Web2 and Web3 by 2026. Brave has become the first web browser to introduce its own blockchain-based domain, launching the “.brave” top-level domain (TLD) in collaboration with Unstoppable Domains. Minted as NFTs on the Polygon blockchain, .brave domains provide an alternative to complicated wallet addresses, allowing users to create personalized, human-readable identities, according to a recent announcement . These domains function without renewal fees and support resolution across major networks including Ethereum, Solana, Base, Sonic, and Bitcoin. .brave Domains Support Decentralized Websites .brave domains also support decentralized websites via IPFS, accessible directly within the Brave browser. “This is more than just a naming system — it’s about giving users control,” said Brave CTO and co-founder Brian Bondy. “.brave is a user-owned identity layer, fully integrated into the Brave ecosystem.” The new domain system will roll out in version 1.81 of Brave Browser and Brave Wallet, initially through Nightly builds with a full release slated for August. Despite the appeal, blockchain domains have yet to achieve widespread functionality across traditional internet infrastructure. Since they operate outside the ICANN-regulated DNS system, they’re not yet universally accessible on all browsers. Today, Brave becomes the first browser to launch an on-chain top-level domain: introducing .brave, in partnership with @unstoppableweb . .brave is now available to Brave’s over 85M users, offering a seamless way to own their digital identity, send crypto, and explore Web3. pic.twitter.com/hUuuhiHxsz — Brave (@brave) May 20, 2025 However, Brave and Unstoppable Domains are aiming to change that, revealing plans to pursue ICANN registration for the .brave gTLD by 2026. This would allow the domain to work across both Web2 and Web3 environments. With more than 85 million monthly active users, Brave has carved a space as a privacy-centric browser, though it still commands just 1% of the global browser market. The .brave domain rollout follows Brave’s integration of the Cardano blockchain into its wallet. Through a partnership with Input Output, the browser now supports Cardano for token management and blockchain access, broadening Brave Wallet’s multi-chain functionality. Brave also hinted at future integrations with Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, which focuses on privacy and smart contracts. Midnight could introduce NFT-based access models that mirror free app experiences in Web2, potentially changing how users interact with crypto-powered applications. Digital Identities to Play Key Role in Future Sandy Carter, COO of Unstoppable Domains, told Cryptonews that she sees digital identities playing a crucial role in various sectors, including healthcare. “Imagine if your healthcare data was stored securely on the blockchain, accessible only with your digital identity,” she said. “This could prevent misdiagnoses and ensure timely access to critical medical information.” Recently, Unstoppable Domains launched city-specific domains like .austin, which can be used for various purposes, including tokenizing personal documents and memberships. “You can go online, purchase a domain like rachel.austin, and use it for all sorts of applications, including social media and crypto transactions,” Carter explained.

Major economies and institutions continuously increase their exposure to digital assets, as these are the future of the financial world. In a significant move, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon announced that the bank will now allow clients to buy Bitcoin. This big step by a financial giant like JPMorgan, alongside other biggies like Morgan Stanley, which is already discussing plans to launch Bitcoin ETFs for eligible clients, shows that digital assets will be taking center stage in the next few years. JUST IN: JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon says the bank will allow customers to buy Bitcoin and crypto directly. pic.twitter.com/BbK1F5Wsdd — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) May 19, 2025 Savvy investors are already seeking the best cryptos to buy now, which could generate an alpha impact on their portfolios. Historically, crypto ICOs have been the frontiers in generating high ROI for investors. The standout presale of the season, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), has achieved a significant milestone by raising $1 million in just 24 hours. The project’s revolutionary model, which utilizes the Bitcoin network to launch meme coins, has created a stir in the market. With massive investor demand, the BPEP presale has broken previous records. In this article, we will discuss what makes Bitcoin Pepe stand out from the crowd and other contenders for this bull cycle. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) presale surprises market experts Major adoption and increasing capital inflow in Bitcoin ETFs are already pushing BTC’s price higher. However, direct proxy plays on Bitcoin were still missing from the market. Bitcoin Pepe is a project that has addressed this problem for investors, as it ties its mechanics to the largest cryptocurrency in the world. Since the launch, BPEP presale demand has been increasing exponentially. On Monday, the token presale raised over $1 million in just 24 hours, driving the total raise to $10.7m. High growth potential and a unique edge over competitors have helped Bitcoin Pepe achieve this milestone. Bitcoin Pepe wants to turn the Bitcoin network into a lively space for meme coin creation, trading, and speculation. By using Bitcoin’s strong foundation and large pools of unused liquidity, it aims to boost both activity and scalability. With its PEP-20 token standard, anyone can launch tokens directly on Bitcoin, making it easier to grow new projects and communities. In the past, token ecosystems like Ethereum’s ERC-20 and Solana’s SPL played a big role in their success. Bitcoin Pepe hopes to follow a similar path by unlocking new possibilities for tokens on Bitcoin. BPEP staking sold out amid massive demand The exchange listing date for BPEP tokens has been finalized for May 31, which has been another big factor in increasing demand. This has resulted in a sold-out situation in Bitcoin Pepe’s staking pools, which are holding over 200 million tokens. For BPEP holders, the filled pools mean they’ve already locked in a chance to earn passive income. Can I get a GM? Found the next 100X – its $BPEP The tier 1's are after it . You've got until the end of the month to lock in before it takes off. pic.twitter.com/aOep2C4Hrb — Smoke (@smokedyor) May 15, 2025 The ecosystem expansion is also in full swing, as Bitcoin Pepe formed multiple strategic partnerships last week. The project now has key relationships with Super Meme, Catamoto, S Plena Finance, GETE Network, Crypto Hunters, and BETV for sectoral expansion and increasing utility. The project is gaining attention from early adopters and meme coin fans who want more than just hype. Experts believe this is the last opportunity investors can grab the BPEP token at a discounted price of $10.7m. By offering real utility along with strong incentives, it’s quickly becoming a favorite among those looking for long-term value rather than just short-term trends. Ethereum price stands strong despite high volatility The Ethereum price was in a consistent downtrend for three months as the market remained bearish after the election rally. However, the Pectra upgrade has reversed the trend of the ETH price. ETH has surged over 90% from the recent swing low, successfully breaking through the crucial resistance of $2,700. However, due to the profit booking post-rally, it is now consolidating in the $2,500-$2,700 range. Source: CoinMarketCap Currently, ETH has strong support at $2,420 along with the 10-day moving average. Once the price gives a decisive breakout from this range, it could rise to the local target of $3,000. If the upside break comes with increased volume, it could mean the Ethereum price is ready to touch $4,000. Ether’s social sentiment has now returned to green bars after remaining in the red zone for a while. The upward trend indicates a potential continuation of momentum in the coming days. The sentiment tracker shows that traders on various social media platforms are discussing Ether more positively than other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Pepe could outshine top coins like Ethereum While the Ethereum price is expected to rise to $3,000, Bitcoin Pepe’s presale is attracting the attention of both institutional and retail investors. Despite being a newcomer in the DeFi space, BPEP has shattered records by raising $1 million in just 24 hours. This high demand comes as investors are looking for the best cryptos to buy, like BPEP . Bitcoin Pepe is winning the game with its strong utility features and explosive price appreciation capability and is set to boom after listing on May 31st. FAQs What is the best crypto to buy now? The best crypto to buy now is Bitcoin Pepe. Backed by major partnerships and a 30-stage presale that raised over $10.7m, it’s generating strong market momentum ahead of its May 31 exchange listing. Can Ethereum reach $3k? Yes, Ethereum can reach $3,000, especially during bullish market conditions. Its strong ecosystem, growing institutional interest, and role in DeFi and NFTs support long-term price growth. Market sentiment and broader crypto trends will be key drivers. Will Bitcoin Pepe sell out soon? Yes, Bitcoin Pepe is likely to sell out soon. As of May 21, 2025, the presale has raised over $10.7m, with the token price increasing at each stage . With the final listing set for May 31, demand is accelerating as investors rush to secure tokens before the presale concludes. How do you find a good crypto presale? To find a good crypto presale, look for projects with doxxed teams, audited contracts, and clear utility. Strong community support and fair tokenomics are also key indicators.

2025-05-21T10:42:08.000Z,"Can Bitcoin Stay Above $100,000? What Does Data Say? Here Are the Details","As Bitcoin has climbed back above the $100,000 level, investors are tempted to liken the rally to the short-lived rallies in January, but recent data and market dynamics suggest that this time the rally is more grounded. Financial conditions, one of the basic indicators that determine the risk appetite of the markets, present a picture in favor of Bitcoin this time. While the dollar index (DXY) fell by 9% from 109 in January to 99.60, the 10-year US Treasury bond interest rate fell from 4.8% to 4.52%. These softening conditions are creating a more favorable environment for risky assets. Although 30-year bond yields have risen above 5%, this development is perceived positively for inflation hedge assets such as gold and Bitcoin. The total market value of stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, such as USDT and USDC, broke the record by reaching $151 billion. This is an increase of about 9% from the average level of $139 billion in the December-January period. The presence of a large capital reserve that can be invested is considered a positive signal for Bitcoin and crypto markets. Bitcoin’s recent rally from $75,000 has largely been driven by directional buying by institutional investors via spot ETFs. Open interest in CME Bitcoin futures rose to $17 billion, the most since February, but is still below the $22.79 billion peak in December. In comparison, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $42.7 billion, surpassing the $39.8 billion level in January. In the past, during Bitcoin’s peaks, there was speculative excitement in memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, there is currently no significant movement or bubble effect in such altcoins. This shows that the market is moving more cautiously this time. There is demand for long (bullish) positions in Bitcoin’s perpetual futures market, but funding rates are well below December highs, suggesting leveraged positions are not overdone and the market is not “heating up” yet. It is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Can Bitcoin Stay Above $100,000? What Does Data Say?

2025-05-21T10:30:44.000Z,"SEC ‘Playing Regulatory Jenga’: Commissioner Crenshaw Slams Agency’s New Crypto Approach","The sole Democratic Commissioner at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Caroline Crenshaw, recently criticized the agency’s new regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies, warning that the watchdog is playing a “dangerous” game. Crypto Regulation’s Jenga Tower In her remarks at the SEC Speak event, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw said that the regulatory agency is undermining its decades of work while staring at “alarming market volatility, emerging risks, and calls for deregulatory action in all corners of our markets.” The Democratic Commissioner affirmed on Monday that the watchdog is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga,” with their “proverbial Jenga Tower,” comprised of “a set of discrete but interrelated rules and laws, deeply and carefully developed over the years.” Criticizing the SEC’s new regulatory approach, Crenshaw questioned how many blocks the Commission can pull “before the tower gives away,” arguing that it has already shaken the tower by pulling institutional integrity, failing to enforce laws, and ignoring potential market risks. She affirmed that the “most devastating” Jenga piece to go was the SEC staff, which has declined by nearly 15% in the past four months. Additionally, Crenshaw blasted the agency’s recent use of guidance on topics like memecoins and crypto mining “to walk away from rules and upend longstanding practice.” In particular, our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations. For example, the statements pull at the threads of our most foundational case law while meekly suggesting – in footnotes – that we still might do the required facts and circumstances analysis in each case. The Commissioner stated that crypto presents “certain novel risks,” which could lead the agency to “repeat hard lessons with high stakes” if they fail to address them as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance . SEC’s New Regulatory Approach One of Crenshaw’s key remarks also addressed the SEC’s long-criticized “regulation by enforcement” approach, slamming the new “regulation by non-enforcement” of the Trump administration. According to the Democratic Commissioner, the term was a “total misnomer” as the agency staff didn’t try to create new laws with the cases. Instead, these actions “applied decades-old precedent to address violations of existing securities laws.” She alleged that the SEC has abandoned its duty to enforce existing law with the shutdown of its enforcement program “in anticipation of creating new crypto-friendly rules.” On the contrary, the SEC’s new chairman, Paul Atkins, criticized the agency’s previous “head-in-the-sand” regulatory approach, affirming that it stalled innovation and created an uncertain state for the crypto industry. At the SEC Speak event, Atkins shared his vision for a more welcoming and constructive regulatory environment, contrary to the previous administration’s aggressive “shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later” strategy. He detailed that this approach led to a communication breach and a lack of trust between the SEC and the crypto industry, which made working together on complex legal matters difficult. Ultimately, Atkins directed the Division of Corporation Finance to address these issues by maintaining transparent interactions with the public. He also announced that the SEC’s policy Division has started drafting rule proposals related to crypto. “As I begin my tenure as Chairman, I can tell you that we are getting back to our roots of promoting, rather than stifling, innovation. The markets innovate, and the SEC should not be in the business of telling them to stand still. It is a new day at the SEC, and I look forward to what we are going to be able to accomplish for investors and the markets,” he concluded.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/sec-playing-regulatory-jenga-commissioner-crenshaw-slams-agencys-new-crypto-approach/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Caroline Crenshaw|Crypto Regulations|Paul Atkins|SEC chair|SEC Commisioner|SEC Crypto|US crypto regulation|US President Donald Trump|US SEC",cryptocompare

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) recently launched XRP futures contracts, and institutions are piling in. The debut saw over $19 million in notional trading volume on day one, followed by another $10 million the next day. That’s nearly $30 million in just two sessions, signaling strong interest from big players. Day One Trading Volume Crosses $19 Million—Momentum Continues XRP Futures launch at $19Million!

Traders can choose between two sizes: standard contracts representing 50,000 XRP and micro ones for 2,500 XRP. Day one saw 7.5 million XRP traded in standard contracts and another 517,000 XRP in micro ones, with more micro trading activity picking up on day two. XRP Futures Contracts: Key Details and Structure This surge of interest has reignited chatter about a potential spot XRP ETF. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, summed up the mood in a recent X post : “Spot XRP ETFs only a matter of time.” The launch of regulated futures is often a stepping stone toward ETF approval, as seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even with all the buzz, XRP’s price stayed mostly flat around $2.38, moving just 0.42% over 24 hours. But the bigger takeaway is the momentum building behind XRP in regulated markets, a key factor that could tip the scales toward that long-awaited ETF greenlight. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Crash?

2025-05-21T10:21:46.000Z,"Ripple’s Quiet Rise: Should Bitcoin Maxis Sweat XRP’s Growing Influence?","Bitcoin (BTC) maximalists have long dismissed altcoins as speculative noise, but XRP’s steady ascent in global finance is challenging that narrative, said a popular social media influencer. While BTC remains the undisputed king of crypto by market cap, Ripple’s native token is carving out a niche where Bitcoin has struggled: real-world financial infrastructure. With new institutional products and a growing list of partnerships, XRP opinion shaper John Squire believes the token is proving it’s not just another altcoin, but a legitimate competitor in the race for mainstream adoption. Bitcoin’s Decentralization Myth vs. XRP’s Pragmatism The influencer ignited debate across X on May 20 with a string of posts arguing that XRP is shaking the foundations BTC never could. “Maxis hate that XRP doesn’t need miners, uses minimal energy, and settles in seconds,” Squire stated. According to him, the battle between the two isn’t technical but ideological. He insisted that XRP is focused on utility, integration, and real-world adoption. “Decentralization? That debate’s over,” he continued. “What matters now is utility. And XRP delivers.” Some may view these assertions as provocative, but there’s growing substance behind them. Ripple is forging partnerships with banks, central banks, and payment providers around the world. In April, the company acquired prime brokerage giant Hidden Road. Additionally, Ripple made a $5 billion bid for stablecoin issuer Circle, which was reportedly rejected. But there are rumors circulating that it subsequently upped its offer to $20 billion in a bid to fend off interest from the Coinbase crypto exchange. More recently, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched XRP futures contracts, opening the door for institutional exposure through both standard and micro-sized offerings. While the launch came just days after a court denied Ripple and the SEC’s proposed $50 million settlement, it made one key point clear: despite legal headwinds, XRP is being taken seriously by the world’s financial elite. The potential use cases for XRP that could come from such deals are what Squire thinks makes the asset more valuable. In his words: “XRP isn’t competing for price — It’s competing for relevance. And every new deal, partnership, or use case is proof.” Can XRP Really Challenge Bitcoin? Still, not everyone is convinced, with one commentator pushing back, questioning which banks actually use XRP rather than merely expressing interest. “No Bitcoiner is nervous about XRP,” he insisted. “XRP is stupidly shaking its own pillars.” Looking at price action, the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency has remained relatively muted despite the CME futures launch. It is currently trading at $2.37, a slight 0.3% uptick in 24 hours, but down 8.4% on the week. In contrast, BTC rose 1.6% since yesterday and 3.5% over the past week to put it within a hair’s breadth of its all-time high.

Bitcoin Solaris: The Hidden Giant Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just another altcoin—it’s engineered to be the next Bitcoin-level opportunity. And it’s already starting to behave like it. The data shows that BTC-S is following a similar early-stage trajectory to Bitcoin in 2011—low price,growing community, limited access, and a surge in interest from both users and analysts. But this time, instead of requiring expensive mining rigs or deep tech knowledge, it’s available to anyone with a smartphone or laptop. Why Bitcoin Solaris is gaining so fast: 10,000 transactions per second 2-second finality 99.95% less energy use than Bitcoin Dual-consensus mechanism: Proof-of-Work for core security + Delegated Proof-of-Stake for speed and scalability Fully audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins ** KYC verified for full transparency And while the Solaris Nova App is still in beta, select community members already have access. That early experience is helping shape the app before its full release—and driving even more attention to BTC-S as a serious, scalable blockchain project. The rising buzz is getting noticed. In a recent detailed review, Crypto Volt broke down why Bitcoin Solaris could be the biggest breakout of 2025. A New Path to Wealth Creation Bitcoin Solaris isn’t only mimicking Bitcoin’s early chart pattern—it’s also recreating the same kind of wealth engine. But this time, it’s built for the modern world. Anyone can mine BTC-S from anywhere, with: Zero hardware setup Low energy impact One-click functionality through the Solaris Nova App This open-access mining model is helping everyday users tap into a financial opportunity once reserved for tech-savvy early adopters. As interest grows across Telegram and X, one thing is clear: this isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a movement forming. Presale Phase 4: The Perfect Entry Point With price action mirroring Bitcoin’s earliest stages, the BTC-S presale couldn’t come at a better time. We’re now deep in Phase 4, and the numbers speak for themselves: Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% But here’s what makes it urgent: the presale only lasts 90 days, and July 31, 2025 marks the launch date. Already, over $1,000,000 has been raised, and more than 8,900 users have joined. With a potential 1,900% return, BTC-S isn’t just matching Bitcoin’s early growth—it’s moving faster. Your Smartphone Just Became a Crypto Powerhouse—Start with BTC-S Referral Program: Community-Powered Growth The Bitcoin Solaris Double Rewards Referral Program is also fueling rapid adoption: Referrers earn a 5% BTC-S commission Referred users get a 5% bonus Rewards are automatically credited with no extra effort This system turns every investor into a growth engine—and it’s working. Referrals are spreading across Telegram groups, Discord chats, and content platforms as more people discover the early potential of BTC-S. Conclusion: The Signs Are All There If you look at Live Coin Watch, the message is clear: Bitcoin Solaris price action mirrors Bitcoin’s early adoption phase—and the opportunity it represents is just as massive. From mobile mining and blazing-fast speeds to a presale packed with momentum, BTC-S is shaping up to be the story of the year. Bitcoin’s early days are gone. But for those who missed that moment, Bitcoin Solaris may be offering the closest thing we’ll ever see again.

2025-05-21T10:15:17.000Z,"How high can Bitcoin price go?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin gained 14% since May 5, breaking $108,000 for the first time since January. Targets of $140,000 and even $200,000 are increasingly discussed for 2025. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has climbed by more than 14% since May 5, rallying to $107,000 on May 21. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin rose 3.6% to a four-month high of $108,000 on May 21 from a low of $104,200 the previous day. The last time BTC/USD traded above this level was on Jan. 20, when President Donald Trump’s inauguration fueled BTC’s price rally to $109,350 all-time high. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s price rise coincides with a marketwide rally , with the global crypto market capitalization rising above $3.36 trillion for the first time since Feb. 3. The uptrend has left market participants wondering how much higher Bitcoin prices can go before a significant correction. Bitcoin price inches toward new highs Bitcoin’s latest recovery has sparked optimism among market analysts and traders, who expect BTC to blast toward new all-time highs. Bitcoin is going to all-time highs today, said popular analyst AlphaBTC in a May 21 post on X. An accompanying chart showed Bitcoin’s price trading within an extended ascending parallel channel since it began its recovery on April 9. As of May 21, BTC’s price was trading 2.5% below its all-time high of over $109,000, which was the next major resistance. If this barrier is broken, AlphaBTC anticipates $115,000 as the next likely target. “It seems inevitable that $BTC takes out the ATH soon, this grind and pop (squeeze) price action is being driven by bigger players that have their targets and know what it takes to use the bears shorting every pop to move the price higher.” BTC/USD 12-hour chart. Source: AlphaBTC “Bitcoin is going to an all-time high faster than I expected,” said MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe in a May 20 post on X. According to van de Poppe, BTC price could rise as high as $200,000 “because more and more people are done with the constant devaluation of the dollar.” Fellow analyst Mags said the price was entering its “biggest bull run ever,” projecting a possible top around $215,000 based on Bitcoin's four-year halving cycle . Source: Mags Meanwhile, network economist Timothy Peterson used statistical analysis to assume a trip to at least $115,000 by the end of June, setting a possible top under $130,000. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sight BTC rounded bottom pattern targets $140K From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s price has formed a rounded bottom chart pattern on the daily chart (see below). Bulls are now focused on pushing the price above the neckline of the prevailing chart pattern at $106,000. A daily candlestick close above this level would confirm a bullish breakout from the rounded bottom formation, ushering BTC into price discovery with the technical target set at $140,956, or a 37% increase from the current level.

2025-05-21T10:12:23.000Z,"New ‘Days to Cover’ Metric Reveals Which Bitcoin Companies Are Truly Stacking","The post New ‘Days to Cover’ Metric Reveals Which Bitcoin Companies Are Truly Stacking appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new metric called ‘Days to Cover’ is gaining rapid traction among Bitcoin investors , offering a fresh way to evaluate companies with large BTC holdings . Introduced by Blockstream CEO Adam Back , this powerful formula shows how long it would take for a company to earn its market valuation in Bitcoin terms—based on its current BTC accumulation rate. As the crypto sector matures, ‘Days to Cover’ is emerging as a key tool to distinguish real Bitcoin builders from hype-driven branders . What Is the ‘Days to Cover’ Metric? The ‘Days to Cover’ metric is calculated using the formula: Days to Cover = ln(mNAV) / ln(1 + Daily BTC Yield) Here’s what it means: mNAV (Market Net Asset Value) is the ratio of a company’s market cap to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. For example, an mNAV of 4.26 means the market values the company at 4.26x its BTC holdings. The formula estimates how many days it would take for a company’s daily BTC yield to “cover” its current valuation. In simple terms, this metric shows how long it would take for a company to earn its market cap in Bitcoin—based on its current stacking pace. ‘Days to Cover’ Breakdown for Top Public BTC Companies MicroStrategist , a leading BTC analysis platform , applied this metric to the top BTC-holding public companies. Here’s what they found: Company mNAV Daily BTC Yield Days to Cover MetaPlanet 5.08 1.49% 110 days MicroStrategy (MSTR) 2.1 0.12% 626 days The Blockchain Group (ALTBG) 9.4 1.48% 152 days Semler Scientific 1.5 0.33% 114 days Companies like MetaPlanet and ALTBG are stacking Bitcoin aggressively—yielding over 1.4% daily . Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, despite its massive holdings of 576,230 BTC , accumulates at a more conservative pace but remains the most institutionally trusted BTC stock. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Bitcoin Heading to $600,000 by October 2025? , Why ‘Days to Cover’ Is Crucial for Bitcoin Investors Real-Time Signal : This metric updates dynamically with a company’s BTC growth. Fundamental Filter : It helps spot genuine Bitcoin-focused companies over hype-driven ones. Investment Indicator : A low ‘Days to Cover’ can hint at undervalued BTC stocks . In March, The Blockchain Group had one of the lowest ‘Days to Cover’ scores—and its stock has since surged over 834% . Final Thoughts As the crypto market evolves, new metrics like ‘Days to Cover’ are becoming essential for investors seeking fundamentally strong BTC plays .Whether you’re a long-term Bitcoin believer or a data-driven trader, this metric offers a unique window into which companies are truly stacking sats —not just talking about it. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-21T10:10:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways : Bitcoin price faces strong bullish correction toward $108K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $105,360, beginning a bearish trend to $101,691. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced increased buying domination in recent hours as buyers gained strong confidence. As a result, it broke through immediate Fib channels, resulting in a surge toward $108K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are set to expand the Trump family’s cryptocurrency business portfolio by investing in Bitcoin mining-focused Hut 8. Hut 8, based in Miami, announced the launch of its majority-owned subsidiary, American Bitcoin, dedicated to Bitcoin mining and strategic reserve development. Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027.

Easing trade tensions creates improved market conditions, which fuel institutional digital asset adoption. As the May 31 listing nears, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) witnesses increasing inflows, gaining traction as the best crypto to buy this altseason. The first and biggest blockchain network, Bitcoin, has achieved a new milestone: its market cap has reached $2.12 trillion for the first time. BTC is now more valuable than major global corporations like Google, valued at $2.022 trillion, and Meta, valued at $1.6 trillion. Image courtesy: CoinMarketCap From the April low of $74,420, the Bitcoin price has surged 43.67% to a 4-month high of $107,137. Bitcoin's historic achievement comes after significant diplomatic developments on the global stage. US President Donald Trump has announced major trade deals, one being with the UK and another ongoing with China. Positive developments in global trade deals have eased tensions in the financial market, improving investors' overall risk appetite. This achievement has made Bitcoin rise in rankings in global assets and has also given a boost to crypto adoption.

Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, has predicted that the Bitcoin price could reach $200k by the end of 2025, while the long-term outlook for 2028 is suggested at $500k. Bitcoin price holds $105K; 10 DMA becomes key support zone Bitcoin's price has reclaimed the $105,000 level after dipping to a low of $102,000 on Monday. With this bounce, $105k and the 10-DMA have now become critical support. This zone, previously a resistance point in early 2025, has been successfully back-tested. According to the chart analysis, BTC's recent close above $105K, combined with a strong candle body and downside wick, signals growing demand from lower levels.

The golden cross forms when the 50-day SMA crosses over the 200-day SMA and is seen as a signal for upcoming price surges. While Bitcoin leads the charge, micro-caps are the ones that create wealth for investors. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is one of the best cryptos to buy now, which aligns with the long-term trend of crypto adoption and more awareness of decentralization and accessibility in equal measure. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): Biggest play on Bitcoin Bitcoin Pepe is one of the emerging projects that could directly benefit from Bitcoin’s rising dominance in global finance. This platform is built to grow by Bitcoin’s increasing market capitalization as it enables a meme launchpad on BTC’s $2 trillion liquidity. Major networks like SOL and ETH have had meme manias in recent years, but have you wondered why there haven’t been any memes on the Bitcoin network? Previous attempts have faced technical difficulties, preventing success, but BPEP has pulled it off with the PEP-20 standard, which will allow the launch of memes on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin has always been a valuable asset. Now, Bitcoin Pepe is making it a leader in meme and retail trading. This layer-2 meme platform could revolutionize the sector by combining Bitcoin’s security with the speed and scalability of Solana. Some devs are calling it “Solana on Bitcoin.” Additionally, Bitcoin Pepe is establishing major ties with influential crypto projects like Super Meme, Plena Finance, and GETE Network, spanning DeFi, AI, and gaming. This move will significantly enhance BPEP’s utility across multiple sectors. Time to stop sleeping on $BPEP as you're going to regret it laterSeen they've got some major partnerships lined up too.Heard the tier 1's are after this one... I'd stack now while you can. https://t.co/T3kuv2iX4G — Zenia (@Zenia_sol) May 14, 2025 Investor confidence in the project has increased exponentially as the staking pools, totaling over 200 million tokens, are now completely sold out due to high demand. Moreover, the ongoing token presale has raised $10.7m in a short period of time. There is only a brief period of time remaining to buy BPEP tokens at an undervalued price of $0.0359 as the presale is racing towards its May 31st Tier 1 exchange listings. Cardano jumps 20% monthly—can it sustain the rally? ADA rose 20% in the last 30 days because of the positive advancements combined with market optimism about network upgrades. Development activity continues to grow on the ADA network thanks to its regular upgrades. Scalability plans alongside strong interoperability functions enable Cardano to develop its position in the market over time. The price movement of ADA faces huge challenges because market conditions and community enthusiasm for new developments tend to drive price changes. The potential increase of ADA might face difficulties because of diminishing investor attention and technical challenges that could disrupt its market position. Best crypto to buy for the biggest bull cycle Bitcoin price holding above $105K is a powerful signal for the broader market. As BTC eyes a breakout above $110K, altcoins are preparing for liftoff. Cardano’s strong rebound reflects ongoing buyer interest, while Bitcoin Pepe offers one of the most lucrative opportunities of the year. With a public presale offering access at just $0.0359, BPEP stands out as a top-tier pick for investors seeking long-term growth. FAQs What is the best crypto to buy now? Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is currently the top cryptocurrency to consider buying. As the first meme coin launching directly on the Bitcoin network, it introduces the PEP-20 token standard, enabling users to create and trade tokens natively on Bitcoin's Layer 2. With its presale concluding on May 31, BPEP is poised for significant growth upon listing on major centralized exchanges. When is Bitcoin Pepe launching? Bitcoin Pepe will list on centralized exchanges on May 31, after wrapping up its 30-stage presale. Is Caradno a good investment? Cardano (ADA) is considered a promising long-term investment in 2025. Its expanding DeFi ecosystem, which recently surpassed $700 million in total value locked, and growing adoption of smart contracts have enhanced its utility and market appeal. Analysts forecast ADA's price to range between $0.66 and $2.36 by the end of 2025, with some projections reaching up to $2.05, reflecting potential for significant growth. Will Bitcoin reach $250k? As of May 21, 2025, Bitcoin is trading around $107,844 . While a rise to $250,000 would require significant market momentum, the current trends and expert analyses suggest it's within the realm of possibility.

2025-05-21T09:51:58.000Z,"Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Reiterates Ripple (XRP) Mission","Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, expressed concern over Senator Cynthia Lummis’ recent cancellation of a meeting with him and her office’s refusal to reschedule. He seized the medium to reiterate Ripple’s mission in the United States and worldwide. In a post on X, Garlinghouse emphasized that Ripple has failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with the Senator in the last six years, despite being a U.S.-based company actively working to expand the domestic crypto economy. Garlinghouse acknowledged that last-minute changes are often unavoidable in a senator’s daily schedule. However, he took issue with the outright refusal to find another time to meet. He stated that the response from Lummis’ staff that the meeting can’t be rescheduled was troubling. He added, “I really have to wonder if this was Sen. Lummis or someone on her staff making this decision.” Thanks for this info. Certainly enlightening that Will Cole is related to Sen Lummis. I understand that things happen in a Senator’s day that force their schedules to change, but for a Congressional staff to say \""unable to reschedule” is really troubling (when we've been unable… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 Potential Conflicts of Interest Surface The situation has gained further attention as new information about Senator Lummis’ personal and financial ties to the Bitcoin industry has emerged. Will Cole, Head of Product at a Bitcoin payments company, was identified by one community member as Lummis’ son-in-law. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cole is a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and has previously shared content criticizing Ripple and Garlinghouse. His recent repost of a post mocking Garlinghouse has increased scrutiny of the Senator’s impartiality. What further raises questions is the fact that Lummis has received financial support from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z), a known backer of various crypto and blockchain projects. Lummis has been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin and is considered one of Congress’s most prominent Bitcoin-aligned lawmakers. These affiliations could explain the Senator’s reluctance to engage with Ripple, a company often positioned in opposition to Bitcoin maximalism. While no formal accusations of misconduct have been made, observers in the crypto community are questioning whether the Senator’s personal and familial connections are influencing her professional decisions. A popular attorney called Bitcoin maximalists immature as they jumped on the situation, attempting to paint it as a victory for BTC, failing to see the harm their actions can do to the crypto market. What’s Next for the Crypto Industry Garlinghouse and others at Ripple have consistently advocated for regulatory clarity, industry support in Washington, and an inclusive approach to crypto regulation. The inability to secure a meeting with Senator Lummis, who has positioned herself as a leader on digital asset policy, has raised concerns about favoritism in the crypto space. For Ripple, exclusion from key policy conversations may affect its ability to contribute to the regulatory landscape, but Garlinghouse remains undeterred.

2025-05-21T09:45:35.000Z,"Where is Bitcoin Pepe headed as analysts see BTC making new highs","Bitcoin hovered near its record peak on Wednesday, with the price stabilizing around $106,700 — just 3% below the all-time high reached on January 20. Ethereum and Ripple also held firm above key technical support levels, helping to sustain a cautiously optimistic tone in broader crypto markets. Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and continues to serve as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. However, its increasing maturity, declining volatility, and rising institutional participation have reduced its appeal for investors targeting outsized, asymmetric returns. In contrast, early-stage tokens like Bitcoin Pepe are gaining traction among risk-tolerant investors looking for higher upside potential. With sentiment improving across the broader crypto market, these speculative assets are well-positioned to benefit from renewed inflows as traders seek exposure to high-volatility plays. Analysts sees BTC hitting new highs Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, noted several key technical zones traders are watching, including the 21-day moving average (currently at $101,640), the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and the 2025 yearly open. Alan pointed out the potential for a Golden Cross forming between the 50-day and 200-day MAs, with confluence from a longer-term trendline. “If the $105,000 level continues to hold, a move toward the all-time high looks increasingly feasible,” Alan said.

In his latest analysis, he flagged $91,800 and $100,700 as key downside levels of interest but emphasized that momentum was favoring the bulls. “It’s always a good morning with Bitcoin at $108,000 and close to a new ATH,” he wrote on X, forecasting that new record highs are arriving “faster than he expected.” Van de Poppe sees $120,000 as the next major milestone, with longer-term targets reaching as high as $200,000. Bitcoin Pepe to list soon A renewed rally in Bitcoin, historically a trigger for wider market momentum, is once again lifting sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape. As capital rotates back into digital assets, speculative tokens — particularly meme coins — are regaining investor attention. Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a notable beneficiary of this trend, positioned at the convergence of meme-driven virality and blockchain infrastructure innovation. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 on the Bitcoin network, it combines the network’s established security with the scalability typically associated with Solana-like architecture. The project has announced a series of strategic partnerships to broaden its Layer 2 ecosystem. These include Super Meme for secure meme coin launches using the PEP-20 standard, Catamoto for BASE chain fair launches, and Plena Finance, which may integrate BPEP into its mobile-first DeFi platform. Additionally, a collaboration with the GETE Network could extend Bitcoin Pepe’s presence into cross-chain Web3 gaming. These integrations aim to enhance the project’s technical foundation and provide potential real-world utility for its token, distinguishing Bitcoin Pepe from purely speculative meme assets. Investor interest appears strong. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale has raised over $10 million so far, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0359. The presale is set to close on May 31, 2025, with an exchange listing expected soon after — an event that could act as a near-term catalyst for price action.

2025-05-21T09:38:16.000Z,"These Six Charts Explain Why Bitcoin's Recent Move to Over $100K May Be More Durable Than January's Run","Bitcoin BTC is trading above $100,000 again, and investors, prone to recency bias, may be quick to assume that this event will play out like it did in December-January, when the bull momentum faded, with prices quickly falling back into six figures, eventually dropping as low as $75,000. However, according to the following six charts, the bitcoin market now appears sturdier than in December-January, suggesting a higher probability of a continued move higher. Financial conditions: (DXY, 10y, 30y yields vs BTC) Financial conditions refer to various economic variables, including interest rates, inflation, credit availability, and market liquidity. These are influenced by the benchmark government bond yield, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, the dollar exchange rate and other factors. Tighter financial conditions disincentivize risk-taking in financial markets and the economy, while easier conditions have the opposite effect. As of writing, financial conditions, represented by the 10-year yield and the dollar index, appear much easier than in January, favoring a sustained move higher in BTC. At press time, the dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against major currencies, stood at 99.60, down 9% from highs above 109.00 in January. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note stood at 4.52%, down 30 basis points from the high of 4.8% in January. The 30-year yield has risen above 5%, revisiting levels seen in January, but is largely seen as positive for bitcoin and gold. More dry powder The combined market capitalization of the top two USD-pegged stablecoins, USDT and USDC, has reached a record high of $151 billion. That's nearly 9% higher than the average $139 billion in December-January, according to data source TradingView. In other words, a greater amount of dry powder is now available for potential investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bold directional bets BTC's run higher from early April lows near $75,000 is characterized by institutions predominantly taking bullish directional bets rather than arbitrage bets. That's evident by the booming inflows into the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the still subdued open interest in the CME BTC futures. According to data source Velo, the notional open interest in the CME bitcoin futures has jumped to $17 billion, the highest since Feb. 20. Still, it remains well below the December high of $22.79 billion. On the contrary, the cumulative inflows into the 11 spot ETFs now stand at a record $42.7 billion versus $39.8 billion in January, according to data source Farside Investors. No signs of speculative fervor Historically, interim and major bitcoin tops, including the December-January one, have been characterized by speculative fervour in the broader market, leading to a sharp rise in market valuations for non-serious tokens such as DOGE and SHIB. There are no such signs now, with the combined market cap of DOGE and SHIB well below their January highs. No signs of overheating The bitcoin perpetual futures market shows demand for bullish leveraged bets, understandably so, considering BTC is trading near record highs. However, the overall positioning remains light, with no signs of excess leverage build-up or bullish overheating, as evidenced by funding rates hovering well below highs seen in December. The chart shows funding rates, which refer to the cost of holding perpetual futures bets. The positive figure indicates a bias for longs and willingness among the bulls to pay shorts to keep their positions open. It's a sign of bullish market sentiment. Implied volatility suggests calm The bitcoin market appears much calmer this time, with Deribit's DVOL index, measuring the 30-day expected or implied volatility, significantly lower than levels observed in December-January and March 2024 price tops. The low IV suggests traders are not pricing in the extreme price swings or uncertainty that typically exists in an overheated market, indicating a more measured and potentially more sustainable uptrend.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/21/these-six-charts-explain-why-bitcoin-s-recent-move-to-over-usd100k-may-be-more-durable-than-january-s-run,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Stablecoins|ETFs|Bonds|DOGE|SHIB|Volatility|market analysis|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T09:33:42.000Z,"Brave becomes the first web browser to launch on-chain domain naming service for over 85m users","The web browser Brave has become the first major browser to launch its own on-chain top-level domain ‘.brave’ in partnership with Unstoppable Domains and powered by Polygon. In an official press release , the web browser announced that the new on-chain naming service would become available for more than 85 million active monthly users. The firm aims to make the domains accessible on the Brave Wallet for cryptocurrency payments and within the main browser’s newest version 1.81, which will be available in Nightly builds and scheduled for release on August 5, 2025. This makes Brave ( BAT ) the first web browser to deploy its own blockchain-based top-level domains or TLDs. Users will be able to mint their named domains as non-fungible tokens on the Polygon ( POL ) network, granting them ownership without renewal fees. The new domains offer users a seamless way to own their digital identity and simplify sending crypto by acting as a replacement to lengthy cryptocurrency wallet addresses, changing them into readable human names. According to the announcement, the domains can be resolved across various networks, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Base ( BASE ), and Sonic ( S ) to name a few.

Sam Altman’s World matches up with dating app giant Match Group Holding a unique .brave domain also allows users to host decentralized websites on the InterPlanetary File System, which can be directly accessed through the browser without incurring any hosting fees. CTO and co-founder Brian Bondy, calls the browser’s first foray into on-chain TLDs as “more than a domain,” as it offers users their very own personalized identity layer that is native to the wider ecosystem. “Our mission is to put privacy, ownership, and control back in the hands of users,” said Bondy. At the moment, the web browser firm and Unstoppable Domains are exploring the possibility of gaining an ICANN general top-level domain registration for 2026. A ICANN gTLD registration would allow for .brave domains to function in both traditional Web2 and decentralized Web3 environments. As previously reported by crypto.news, the firm’s wallet recently added support for Cardano ( ADA ) after its recently announced partnership with Input | Output. The partnership aims to bring Cardano native assets to wallet users, allowing them to send, receive and swap ADA. Not only that, the web3 wallet also offers governance support for ADA holders, with capabilities directly accessible from within the browser firm’s wallet.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders. With over $200 billion in circulation and US Federal Reserve interest rates at 4.3%, Pendle estimated that stablecoin holders are missing out on over $9 billion in annual yield.Pendle TVL share by assets.

The approval allows yield-bearing stablecoins to operate under specific rules, including registration, disclosure requirements and investor protections.  Moreover, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) further signal a favorable direction.Meanwhile, Pendle said it expects stablecoin issuance to double to $500 billion in the next 18 to 24 months.

The platform will be powered by Maia, an AI core engine developed by My Aion, and aims to optimize and manage systems across mobility, energy, education, healthcare and digital services. My Aion CEO Daniele Marinelli said the AI will know the user well enough to “recommend the perfect place for your anniversary dinner and book it for you without you lifting a finger.”The project will debut in Abu Dhabi before expanding internationally. It is expected to launch in 18 months. Multibillion-dollar AI project to create jobs for UAE nationalsThe project is structured under a $2.5 billion Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, a public-private partnership model for large-scale infrastructure and technology projects. Under the model, private sector entities construct the infrastructure, run and manage the system for a certain period. The companies usually recoup their investments and earn profits during the operational phase. At the end of the period set by the parties involved, ownership and control of the systems developed through the BOT model are transferred to the government or a public sector entity. Bold Technologies CEO Thani Al Thani Al Falasi said the initiative will support UAE job creation. “This initiative will support job creation for UAE nationals, foster local innovation and contribute meaningfully to the national AI ecosystem,” he said. My Aion’s Marinelli said that relocating to Abu Dhabi provides their global operations with a new chapter. “The UAE offers the infrastructure and institutional support needed to scale responsibly and strategically,” Marinelli said.Cointelegraph has reached out to Bold Technologies and My Aion for more information. Related: Decentralized OORT AI data hits top ranks on Google KaggleCrypto proponents say AI could benefit from digital assetsOn May 20, Catena Labs, a project led by Circle co-founder Sean Neville, announced that it will create an AI-native financial institution.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case. In August 2024, NFT trading platform OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC, alleging that NFTs traded on the marketplace could qualify as unregistered securities. On Feb. 22, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the SEC has officially closed its investigation into the platform. The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries. The lawyers urged the SEC to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws.”Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-royalties-not-securities-sec-peirce?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T08:27:53.000Z,"South Korea tightens crypto rules ahead of institutional market entry","South Korea is tightening rules around digital asset transactions as it prepares to allow institutional players into its crypto market, introducing new guidelines for nonprofit crypto sales and stricter listing standards for exchanges.On May 20, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea said during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting that it had finalized sweeping new measures.Set to take effect in June, the updated rules allow both nonprofit organizations and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies, but under new compliance standards.Nonprofit entities must have at least five years of audited financial history to be permitted to receive and sell virtual asset donations. They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations. Source: FSCRelated: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFsExchange sales to be restrictedCrypto exchanges will be allowed to liquidate user fees paid in crypto, but only to cover operational costs. Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors.Cointelegraph contacted South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cardsSouth Korean candidates push pro-crypto agendaSouth Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, aiming to curb capital flight and bolster the country’s financial autonomy.Speaking at a recent policy forum, Lee said a won-based stablecoin could help retain domestic wealth and reduce dependence on foreign-backed digital currencies such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC).The initiative is part of Lee’s broader push for digital asset reforms, which also includes legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party, has also expressed support for introducing spot crypto ETFs, signaling bipartisan momentum on the issue.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-tightens-kyc-rules-ahead-of-institutional-crypto-entry?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC.

However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation.

Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some.

The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy.Payjoin Developer Kit’s website. Source: Payjoin Dev KitPayjoin was first proposed by Nicolas Dorier in 2019 in Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 78. The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction.“Namely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,“ the Maelstrom announcement states.A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen’s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach:“We believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.“Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure — zkSNACKs CEOPayjoin: Soon in wallets near you?Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets. He explained that the funding will enable him to work on the project full time.The announcement points out that the system presents challenges, with the receiver needing to be online and the payment communication flow being more complex than normal non-interactive Bitcoin transactions. Maelstrom’s chief investment officer and BitMEX crypto exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes said that “improving financial privacy in Bitcoin is extremely important.” He added:“The great thing about Payjoin is that if only a small amount of adoption is achieved, it breaks a key assumption used by financial surveillance companies. The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.“A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm “is keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.” The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects.Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin?Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or notHayes noted that “Payjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don’t use it.” Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily.Allen told Cointelegraph he is “building out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.” He explained that encouraging its adoption “is the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.” The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that “a key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.” “In particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,” they added.Magazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-payjoin-privacy-grant-maelstrom?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states.

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.”Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.”Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-crenshaw-agency-playing-regulatory-jenga-with-crypto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.Backlash in the courtsThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers.

2025-05-19T21:32:21.000Z,"What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinner","On May 22, US President Donald Trump is expected to host up to 220 people who had purchased the most significant quantities of his memecoin at a private event in Washington, DC.Though the exact number of attendees was unknown as of May 19, reports and blockchain data have revealed some of the tokenholders who qualified to apply for the May 22 dinner and “VIP tour” and reception, presumed to be in the White House. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22. The Democratic Party’s arm in Arlington, Virginia, announced its members would gather to oppose those in the White House “cashing in on their public office.” Cointelegraph reached out to the organization for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Buying influence, or just speculating on an emerging market?The top 220 tokenholders reportedly spent a combined $148 million to have the opportunity to attend the event, which finalized its leaderboard on May 12. However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
