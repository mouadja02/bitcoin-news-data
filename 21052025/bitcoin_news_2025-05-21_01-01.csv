2025-05-20T23:00:12.000Z,"Dogecoin Chart Too Good To Ignore, Says Trader Eyeing Double","Dogecoin slipped 7% early this week, wiping out much of its gains from last Friday. But a pair of chart watchers say the pullback could be brief. According to analysis from Jake Wujastyk, the meme token is poised for a sharp climb once key levels hold. Based on reports from fellow analyst Bitcoinsensus, there’s even more upside sketched out on detailed patterns. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $10K Rhythm: Steady Climb Signals Strong Push To $115K Chart Pattern Signals Potential Breakout Jake Wujastyk spotted a descending triangle that began forming after Dogecoin hit $0.26 on May 11. Prices swung between the upper resistance line and a lower support line, tightening the wedge. Earlier, DOGE surged 8% in a single session, pushing near the top trend line. Daily Trend Break Opportunity on $DOGE 🔥#Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout💹 The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation. Next… pic.twitter.com/tykuWOfAbs — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 19, 2025 Now the coin has dipped back into the wedge, but it’s still trading between those two lines. If the pattern breaks upward, Wujastyk argues that it could set the stage for a rapid move higher. Volume hasn’t spiked yet, so the setup isn’t sealed. But the shape of the chart suggests potential for a breakout. #Dogecoin There’s no way I couldn’t take this trade with a chart that looks like this. Target is a double here around 45 cents. pic.twitter.com/HxbrFVseiv — Jake Wujastyk (@Jake__Wujastyk) May 18, 2025 Analyst Forecasts Rapid Price Rise Based on reports, Wujastyk expects a “twofold rally” from current levels. That means pushing from around $0.21 today to roughly $0.45. That’s about 114% higher. He’s confident there’s “no way you won’t take a Dogecoin trade” if the chart action holds. His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week’s gains. Wujastyk’s bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge’s support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says. Mixed Targets Highlight Uncertainty Another voice, analyst Bitcoinsensus, sees a similar move to above $0.40 but on a slightly different pattern. He points to an inverse head‑and‑shoulders that formed between March and early May. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight The left shoulder came from a March 11 low at $0.14, the head from an April 7 dip to $0.13, and the right shoulder near $0.16 on May 6. After the pattern broke out, DOGE hit a trendline that’s capped gains since December’s $0.48 high. Even with a pullback from that supply zone, Bitcoinsensus says a further push could launch Dogecoin back toward $0.42–$0.43 within seven days. Those targets suggest a 100–104% jump from today’s price.

2025-05-20T22:56:26.000Z,"Strive plans discounted Bitcoin play with Mt Gox creditor claims","Strive Enterprises, the asset management firm founded by pro-crypto entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, is planning to buy distressed Bitcoin claims. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm said this would allow it to gain BTC exposure at a discount. According to the filing , the Ohio-based corporation is partnering with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to source for such claims and purchase them. The filing specifically mentioned the Mt Gox bankruptcy estate with approximately 75,000 Bitcoin, noting that such distressed and definitive claims could be cheaper. It said: “This strategy is intended to allow Strive the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin exposure at a discount to market price, enhancing Bitcoin per share and supporting its goal of outperforming Bitcoin over the long run.” The Bitcoin stash of the defunct Japanese exchange has been a subject of multiple discussions in the crypto industry since 2014, when they were stolen and the exchange filed for bankruptcy. While efforts to repay creditors have been ongoing for several years, many are still unpaid because they have yet to complete the required process. This has led to multiple extensions of the repayment deadline, with the extension coming in October 2025. Unsurprisingly, there have been concerns that selling pressures from Mt Gox repayments could affect the Bitcoin price as many creditors could opt to sell. If Strive can achieve its plan, the firm could absorb the selling pressures while ending several creditors’ wait for repayment. Strive pushing to redefine corporate Bitcoin exposure. The move by Strive shows how the company adopts a different approach to Bitcoin treasury adoption. Unlike Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) approach of accumulating Bitcoin for its treasury, Strive wants to outperform the flagship asset. In order to achieve this, the firm plans to use several innovative strategies to gain Bitcoin exposure at a discount without diluting its share value. Strive’s Chief Financial Officer, Ben Pham, said: “Strive intends to use all available mechanisms, including novel financial strategies not used by other Bitcoin treasury companies, to maximize its exposure to Bitcoin.” One of the strategies is using Section 351 of the US tax code for tax-deferred Bitcoin for equity swaps. Under this framework, accredited Bitcoin holders can swap their BTC for Strive equity without paying capital gains. The firm also plans to buy cash at a discount by merging with public companies with more cash than their stock value, with the excess cash spent on acquiring more Bitcoin. Other planned strategies include deploying its fixed income and derivative expertise to leverage and hedge risks for Bitcoin acquiring and raising external public capital. So far, Strive has made progress toward its goal, with the firm recently merging with publicly traded social media technology company Asset Entities Inc. That move allowed it to become publicly traded and, therefore, have access to public capital. 85 companies now hold over 800,000 BTC While Strive is working on strategies to acquire Bitcoin, several publicly traded companies are accumulating it in the old-fashioned way. According to data from HODL15 Capital, 85 companies currently hold over 800,000 Bitcoin as of May 19. Leading the pack is Strategy, which now has 576,230 BTC in its treasury. Companies such as Marathon Digital, TwentyOne, and Riot Platforms are way behind, each with less than 50,000 BTC. Bitcoin Treasury Companies (Source: Hodl15Capital) However, companies such as Metaplanet and Semler Scientific have increased their exposure to BTC in the past few weeks, and Metaplanet is now close to entering the top 10. The firm is ranked eleventh with 7,800 BTC, while Block (formerly Square) is tenth with 8,584 BTC. With Metaplanet aiming to finish 2025 with 10,000 BTC, the Japanese firm could have more BTC than Coinbase by the end of the year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

BTC price is on the cusp of rallying toward a new all-time high catalyzed by high demand from institutional investors. The Texas Strategic Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve bill (SB 21) passed the second reading of the House on Tuesday, May 20, with 105 yes votes against 23 nays. The Texas’ SB 21 bill now moves to a third house reading and the final move. As a result, Dennis Porter, the CEO and Co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, now estimates that Texas will be the third state to pass the SBR legislation into law. Moreover, the Texas’ SB 21 bill has massive backing from legislators led by Representative Giovanni Capriglione and Senator Charles Schwertner. The Texas SB 21 bill confirms that the United States will imminently approve its SBR legislation to purchase up to 1 million BTCs in the next five years.

According to the report, Bitcoin’s recent strong price performance has led to significant improvements in investor portfolios, leading many investors to take steps toward risk reduction and profit taking. Glassnode reported that driven by these new capital inflows, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap has reached an all-time high above $900 billion for the first time, marking a major turning point in the asset’s history. Bitcoin rose to $107,000 in the past days and today according to Binance TR data, approaching its all-time high (ATH) of $109,000, which it reached in December 2024. This rise triggered new capital inflows into the market, paving the way for the Realized Market Value to break its historical record. Related News: Analyst Warns: “Bitcoin's Record High Has No Meaning, Focus on This Level Instead” The report also noted that short-term investors have seen one of the sharpest increases in profitability in recent times. This group of investors has seen a significant increase in spending, with a daily realized profit of $747 million and a total of $11.4 billion in the last 30 days. Apart from Bitcoin, Ethereum’s price has also seen a significant increase in recent weeks. It was stated that this increase could be related to the positive atmosphere created by the successful Pectra upgrade that took place on May 7. Ethereum has shown statistically significant increases on a daily basis several times. In particular, the single-day increase of 21.8% attracted attention as the strongest increase since May 2021. Glassnode identified the $2,400 to $2,900 range as a critical resistance zone and potential breakout level for Ethereum, noting that staying above this level is important for the continuation of the uptrend. *This is not investment advice.

Germany’s summer 2024 Bitcoin sale is looking like a $2.3 billion blunder, and the US Senate moves forward with a key stablecoin bill. Argentina's Milei shuts down task force investigating LIBRA scandal Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved a task force established to investigate the fallout from LIBRA, the scandalous cryptocurrency project the head of state promoted on his social media channel before it crashed to zero. The Investigative Task Force (ITU) was dissolved via a May 19 decree signed by Milei and Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, government documents revealed . “The Research Task Unit is dissolved” after completing its mandate, the translated version of the decree read. The task force is being dissolved despite pressure from opposition groups, which are seeking to activate an investigative commission as soon as May 20, local media outlet Clarin reported . Government officials established the UTI on Feb. 19, days after Milei promoted LIBRA on his official X account. A screenshot of Milei’s tweet endorsing LIBRA. Source: TRM Labs His endorsement briefly sent LIBRA soaring from practically worthless to $5 a token and a nearly $5 billion market capitalization, before quickly crashing to zero in what appeared to be a classic pump-and-dump scheme. The fallout from LIBRA sparked allegations of insider trading and manipulation, with Milei caught in the crosshairs. German government missed out on $2.3 billion profit after selling Bitcoin at $57,000 The German government missed out on more than $2 billion worth of Bitcoin profit after selling its holdings in 2024, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham. A “ German Government (BKA) ” labeled cryptocurrency wallet sold 49,858 Bitcoin ( BTC) worth over $2.89 billion at an average price of $57,900 across multiple transactions during June and July in 2024. The decision to sell the Bitcoin early cost the German government over $2.35 billion, according to crypto intelligence platform Arkham. Source: Arkham “If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24B,” Arkham said in a May 19 X post, noting that Bitcoin has risen more than 80% since the sale. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at more than $104,700, according to CoinMarketCap data. The German government-labeled wallet first raised speculation of a potential sell-off on June 19, 2024, when it executed a 6,500 BTC transfer worth over $425 million. The wallet originally held around 50,000 BTC, believed to have been seized from the operators of Movie2k, a now-defunct pirated film site.

2025-05-20T22:01:50.000Z,"US Senate Advances GENIUS Stablecoin Legislation Despite Democrat Opposition","The U.S. Senate voted Monday to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins, following a 66-32 procedural vote. The legislation, introduced by Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), seeks to establish a federal framework for stablecoin issuers, requiring full asset backing, monthly reserve disclosures, and annual audits for issuers exceeding $50 billion in market capitalization. The bill also restricts algorithmic stablecoins and prohibits large technology firms from issuing stablecoins unless they meet financial risk and consumer privacy criteria. The vote comes two weeks after Senate Democrats blocked the measure, citing concerns over consumer protections and potential conflicts of interest related to President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures. “The bill as it currently stands still has numerous issues that must be addressed, including adding stronger provisions on anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, national security, preserving the safety and soundness of our financial system, and accountability for those who don’t meet the act’s requirements.” Several Democratic senators later changed their stance, allowing the bill to proceed to debate on the Senate floor. The GENIUS Act is expected to face further amendments before a final vote, which could take place as early as the end of the week. If enacted, the bill would mark the first federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a sector currently valued at nearly $250 billion.

2025-05-20T22:00:40.000Z,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key","Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-20T21:19:07.000Z,"Anticipated Report on Ripple (XRP) Released: Here’s the Latest on the Network’s Status and Health","Cryptocurrency analytics firm Messari has published its report titled “The State of the XRP Network in Q1 2025.” According to the report, XRP has positively differentiated itself from other major crypto assets in terms of both market capitalization and network activity. While the market value of XRP increased by 2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in the first quarter of 2025, the combined market value of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) decreased by 22% in the same period. RLUSD, the US dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Ripple, has become the largest stablecoin on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) network with a market cap of $44.2 million. On April 8, Ripple acquired Hidden Road, a global multi-asset prime broker. With this move, Ripple became the first crypto company to acquire such a brokerage. Hidden Road plans to move its post-trade operations to XRPL and use its RLUSD stablecoin as collateral. Related News: Analyst Warns: “Bitcoin's Record High Has No Meaning, Focus on This Level Instead” On March 31, XRPL’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible sidechain was launched on testnet. The mainnet launch is planned for the second quarter. Additionally, a new roadmap was announced to enable native smart contracts on XRPL. The first step in this process will be the introduction of “Extensions,” a feature that will allow developers to add code to existing XRPL structures. According to the Messari report, all key metrics on XRPL increased for the second consecutive quarter. This is the first time this has happened since Messari began its analysis of the XRP network in 2023. The most notable increase was seen in the average daily active addresses, which increased by 142% to 134,600, indicating growth in both new and existing users. Average daily central order book (CLOB) volume increased 74% to $13.7 million, while automated market maker (AMM) volume decreased 13% to $4.5 million. Payment transactions increased 36% to 1.12 million, following an 8% decline in the previous quarter. New protocols have also been proposed on XRPL that will pave the way for regulatory-compliant enterprise use cases. The “Credentials” feature ensures identity verification (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, while “Permissioned Domains” will allow domains to be created that only users with certain credentials can access. *This is not investment advice.

According to the scenario he shared on Twitter, Krueger predicts that Bitcoin will rise from $150,000 to $600,000 within 90 days, starting from July 21, 2025. He argues that this extraordinary rise will be triggered by major shocks and geopolitical developments in the global economic system. On the other hand, Bitcoin left behind an important milestone today by seeing $106,000, according to Binance TR data. This fictional scenario, which Fred Krueger titled “The Last Rally,” develops in five stages. Here is what could happen according to Krueger’s scenario: Phase I A $200 billion Treasury bond auction in the U.S. fails. The FED signals that it may take extraordinary measures. During this period, BTC rose from $158,000 to $165,000, while gold rose to $4,200. BRICS countries establish an independent payment network that works with gold and BTC. Phase II A large pension fund in the US cannot meet its obligations. The Fed implements “Yield Curve Control” (YCC), which caps the 10-year bond yield at 6.5%. The dollar is losing value rapidly. BTC reaches $215,000, oil hits $122 and gold hits $5,800. Germany announces that it will support the euro with 10% gold reserves.

2025-05-20T20:49:27.000Z,"HOT MOMENTS: Bitcoin Price Breaches $107,000 – Heading for a Record High – Here’s the Latest and Liquidations","The cryptocurrency market has begun the exciting wait for a new all-time high price record, with the Bitcoin price recently surpassing $107,000 today. The BTC price broke the all-time high price record at $109,114 on January 20, 2025. Only a 2.23% increase from the current level of $106,534 will bring the record. However, when we take into account inflation in the US, the BTC price needs to exceed $110,187 to reach its January purchasing power price.

Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of the ongoing disagreements between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.

For bitcoin BTC, though, some analysts say this season could mark a break from tradition. \""As we get into the European summer months, the sense is it's more likely a case of 'buy in May and go away' than any significant headwinds or selling pressure,\"" said Paul Howard, director at crypto trading firm Wincent in a market note. A confluence of positive regulatory developments around digital assets in the U.S. and increasing institutional buying both via exchange-traded funds and spot allocation is poised to push BTC higher in the next months, Howard said. U.S.-traded spot bitcoin ETFs, for example, pulled in $667 million in net inflows on Monday with BTC pausing just below its January record, underscoring persistent demand, he noted. The vehicles attracted $3.3 billion in May, per SoSoValue. On top of that, there's been a flurry of companies joining Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) adding bitcoin to their treasury, financed by debt and stock issuances. \""As we edge closer to a $4 trillion market cap for digital assets, we will see BTC cross all-time-highs in the coming weeks,\"" Howard said. The total crypto market cap currently stands at around $3.3 trillion, per TradingView data. Historically, summer months have been slow for crypto assets, but macro and political forces are also converging in ways that could disrupt the typical seasonal lull, analysts at crypto analytics firm Kaiko pointed out. The Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision in June will precede Donald Trump's July 9 tariff deadline for trade partners, both of which could trigger market-wide volatility, the report said. Bitcoin options markets are already flashing signs of investor anticipation, Kaiko analysts said. Strike prices at $110,000 and $120,000 for the June 27 expiry have drawn heavy volume, suggesting bets on BTC making a record-breaking move, the report noted.

The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures surged to a record high on May 20, raising questions about whether bearish positions are now at risk. Despite repeated failures to break above the $107,000 level since May 18, the sheer volume of leveraged positions could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high. Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest, USD. Source: CoinGlass The total open interest in BTC futures climbed to $72 billion on May 20, marking an 8% increase from $66.6 billion just a week earlier. Institutional demand continues to be a major driver of this leverage, with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) leading at $16.9 billion in BTC futures, followed by Binance, which holds $12 billion in open interest. $1.2 billion in bearish BTC liquidations cluster at $107K–$108K According to CoinGlass estimates, the largest concentration of bearish BTC futures liquidations is clustered between $107,000 and $108,000, amounting to approximately $1.2 billion. Bitcoin futures leverage heatmap, USD million. Source: CoinGlass While it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers. More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin. Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocations Gold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver. Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K begins For perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC. There is little doubt that institutional buying remains the primary catalyst for Bitcoin to break above the $108,000 level. Such a move would trigger the liquidation of heavily leveraged bearish positions, likely accelerating the push to a new all-time high. However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment. As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 114.83 points, or 0.27%, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.39%, ending a six-day winning streak. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.38% as chipmakers and megacaps retreated, led by losses in Nvidia, AMD, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft. The tech sector was the S&P 500’s worst performer, falling roughly 0.9%. The pullback follows a five-week rebound that lifted the S&P 500 more than 20% off its April low, driven by optimism around tariff de-escalation following President Trump’s earlier tariff announcement. The index is now about 3% below its all-time high. “We’ve had the swoon related to tariffs, the furious rally, and now we’re awaiting clarification,” said Bill Northey of U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “It’s optimism without clarity.” Meanwhile, bond markets added to the unease. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.48%, while the 30-year briefly topped 5% for the second straight day—its highest since November 2023. The rise follows Moody’s decision to downgrade U.S. debt, citing ballooning deficits and rising interest expenses.

This is seen in the way traders move and store their assets. Data analyzed by the market intelligence platform Santiment revealed that the supply of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) on crypto exchanges has hit multi-year lows. While this development does not guarantee anything, it is a major bullish sign and has vast implications for the market. BTC and ETH Exchange Supply Dries Up According to Santiment, BTC’s supply on exchanges has fallen to 7.1% for the first time since November 2018. Over the last five years, there has been 1.7 million less BTC on crypto trading platforms. Similarly, ETH now has less than 4.9% of its supply on crypto exchanges for the first time in more than 10 years. It also has 15.3 million fewer coins on trading platforms over the last five years. A shrinking supply of a certain cryptocurrency on exchanges often means a decline in assets available for immediate sale. This also means that investors are more confident and are moving their assets to cold storage for long-term holding, with the expectation of future price appreciation. With shrinking supply comes reduced selling pressure, especially over the short term. This leads to high price swings , especially if demand rises. Is Demand Rising? One way to determine if the BTC and ETH markets are experiencing higher demand is to examine flows into their investment products. The United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market has recorded eight days of positive flows out of the last ten trading days. The daily inflows have been running into hundreds of millions of dollars. Spot Ethereum ETFs have also seen notable inflows over the same time frame, although not as much as BTC. Additionally, data from CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report indicates that digital asset investment products attracted positive flows for the fifth consecutive week, with Ethereum and Bitcoin funds recording substantial inflows. While demand for BTC and ETH continues, their prices are up slightly in the past 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that BTC trading is at $105,290, and ETH is hovering around $2,527 at the time of writing.

2025-05-20T20:05:34.000Z,"Standard Chartered Stands Firm on $500,000 Bitcoin Price: Here’s Why","Standard Chartered Bank has indirectly highlighted the increasing interest of governments and state institutions in Bitcoin in the first quarter of this year. The bank noted that this increase was made possible through MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares and supports its goals for Bitcoin to reach $500,000 by 2029. “The latest 13F data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports our core thesis that Bitcoin is being adopted by broader institutional investors and that the price will reach $500,000 before President Donald Trump's term ends,” the report, written by Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank's head of digital assets research, said. According to Kendrick, as more investors gain access to Bitcoin and volatility decreases, portfolios will optimize their underweight positions against Bitcoin over time. Interest in direct Bitcoin ETFs has been “disappointing,” while interest in MicroStrategy stock has been “very encouraging,” according to 13F filings, which are mandatory quarterly reports filed by institutional investors managing $100 million or more in assets in the U.S. Related News: JUST IN: Argentina's President Makes Another Controversial Move Related to the LIBRA Cryptocurrency Scandal He Is Involved In The most notable ETF move came when the Wisconsin State Investment Board liquidated its entire position in BlackRock’s IBIT fund, worth the equivalent of 3,400 BTC. The fund stands out as the most widely used Bitcoin ETF among government institutions. Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi-based quasi-government institution Mubadala increased its IBIT holdings from the equivalent of 4,700 BTC to 5,000 BTC. But what really caught the eye was government interest in MSTR stock. According to Kendrick, some government agencies prefer to access BTC indirectly through companies like MicroStrategy due to legal restrictions on buying Bitcoin directly. In the first quarter of 2024, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, the Swiss National Bank, and South Korea’s pension and investment institutions each added around 700 BTC equivalent of MSTR shares. In the US, the pension funds of the states of California, New York, North Carolina, and Kentucky invested around 1,000 BTC equivalent in total. Sweden and Liechtenstein also saw small increases, while France and Saudi Arabia also showed indirect interest in Bitcoin by buying small amounts of MSTR shares for the first time. “The 13F data shows that Bitcoin is a maturing market and is attracting new types of institutional investors, which could help push the price to $500,000,” Kendrick said. “When institutions buy Bitcoin, prices typically go up.” *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin mining in the United States has helped secure the network amid mainstream adoption by institutional investors. Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT), an established Bitcoin (BTC) miner based in the United States, announced that it has upsized its existing $100 million credit facility with Coinbase Credit to $200 million. Riot Platforms secured the credit facility through a portion of its Bitcoin holding, which will be held as collateral by Coinbase Credit. The Bitcoin miner intends to use the funds to enable key strategic initiatives, which might include purchases of new BTC miners, and increasing its power output through renewable energy sources. “Riot is pleased to upsize the credit facility with Coinbase, which is a demonstration of our efforts to diversify our financing sources and lower our cost of capital in order to support greater long-term value creation for our shareholders,” Jason Les, CEO of Riot Platforms, announced . Riot Platforms and the Bitcoin Strategy As Coinpedia reported in the past, Riot Platforms has been a major buyer of Bitcoin in addition to mining BTC. Earlier this month, Riot Platforms released the first quarter 2025 financial results, which revealed that the company held 19,223 Bitcoins after adding 1,530 coins during the quarter. During the first quarter, Riot Platforms announced the acquisition of Rhodium’s mining operations, which had 125 MW of power. As a result, Riot Platforms increased its Bitcoin mining hashrate to 33.7 EH/s by the end of the first quarter.The company’s increased support for the Bitcoin network has played a crucial role in the stabilization process, which has significantly prevented the 51 percent attack and thus attracted more institutional investors. Furthermore, the cash inflow to Bitcoin’s investment products has significantly increased in the recent past, led by the U.S. spot BTC ETFs.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/riot-platforms-upsizes-credit-facility-to-200m-with-coinbase/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING","News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin ETFs’ inflows exceed expectations Bitcoin ETFs have reached a new milestone with assets under management (AUM) surpassing $133 billion, fueled by massive inflows and surging institutional demand. Spot Bitcoin ETF AUM | Source: The Block In the past five weeks alone, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $6.63 billion, with $667.40 million entering the funds on May 19 alone, according to Coinglass’ Total Bitcoin Spot ETF Net Inflow (USD) data . This marks one of the most aggressive periods of accumulation since ETFs were introduced, hinting at strong confidence from institutional players. The spike in inflows comes amid rising technical optimism. Analysts have pointed to a looming “golden cross,” a bullish signal that occurs when the 50-day simple moving average crosses above the 200-day average. Historically, this pattern has preceded long-term rallies in Bitcoin’s price. Despite minor price pullbacks, market sentiment remains notably bullish. In fact, even on days of correction, inflows persisted, revealing that investors are buying the dip rather than retreating. Notably, the continued inflows have coincided with a broader shift in investor sentiment, as reflected by the Crypto Fear and Greed Index moving deeper into the “greed” zone. Analysts view this convergence of sentiment and technical patterns as a foundation for Bitcoin’s next rally, possibly pushing it toward a fresh all-time high. Ethereum co-founder’s $262M ETH transfer sparks speculation While Bitcoin shines in the ETF arena, Ethereum faced renewed scrutiny following a significant whale movement linked to one of its cofounders. Jeffrey Wilcke, a lesser-known but foundational figure in Ethereum’s early development, transferred 105,732 ETH (worth approximately $262 million) to Kraken, a move that immediately raised eyebrows in the crypto community. According to data from Arkham Intelligence , the transaction was executed at block height 22,524,638 with a minimal fee of $0.16. Such massive transfers to centralised exchanges often suggest potential sell-offs, especially when conducted through platforms like Kraken, which are known for high-volume liquidations. The timing of the move added to the uncertainty, occurring just as Ethereum was rebounding 1.56% to around $2,490 after dipping to $2,452. While it remains unclear whether Wilcke’s wallet had been dormant before this transfer, the sudden activity has unsettled some traders. Ethereum has struggled to breach the $2,500 resistance level, and this movement by a known insider has added to market jitters. Adding to the unease, other high-volume ETH transfers linked to notable entities such as Justin Sun and the Ethereum Foundation have taken place in recent weeks. Moreover, the optimism that initially surrounded the Pectra upgrade is beginning to wane. Reports of a possible bug in Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7702 (EIP-7702) have cast doubts on the upgrade’s long-term stability. As a result, market watchers are urging caution, especially if Wilcke’s transaction signals broader intentions within Ethereum’s founding circles. Argentina’s president disbands task force probing LIBRA scandal In a surprising political twist, Argentina’s President Javier Milei has ordered the disbandment of the special task force investigating the high -profile LIBRA scandal . The probe had been initiated to examine alleged financial mismanagement and regulatory breaches tied to the LIBRA crypto project, which had drawn significant criticism from global financial watchdogs. Milei’s decision to halt the investigation comes amid sweeping reforms aimed at reducing governmental oversight in financial markets. Supporters argue that the move reflects a desire to attract innovation and promote cryptocurrency adoption within Argentina. However, critics see it as a political manoeuvre that undermines transparency and accountability, particularly in light of LIBRA’s controversial history. Although the official statement cited “budgetary constraints and institutional restructuring” as the rationale behind the move, sources within the government suggested that the order may have been influenced by external lobbying from crypto-linked interests. This development effectively ends one of the most closely-watched regulatory inquiries in Latin America, leaving questions about the future of crypto oversight in the region. Conclusion From historic ETF inflows and whale-sized Ethereum transfers to sweeping political decisions in South America, the cryptocurrency space remains as dynamic as ever. Bitcoin appears to be entering a bullish phase driven by institutional confidence, while Ethereum navigates uncertainty amid high-stakes movements by key players. Meanwhile, the regulatory developments, such as Argentina’s pivot on LIBRA, continue to shape the global crypto narrative.

2025-05-20T19:55:27.000Z,"Robinhood Presses SEC for Clarity on Tokenizing RWAs in Bid for On-Chain Stock Trading: Report","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting regulatory clarity on the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and its potential application to on-chain stock trading. According to a Forbes report , the proposal, filed with the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, outlines a framework for compliant issuance, custody, and trading of tokenized assets, aiming to modernize US capital markets. Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan told Forbes, “This proposal could mark the first time a U.S.-regulated broker has laid out a viable path for bringing trillions of dollars in assets onchain – without compromising regulatory integrity. If the SEC embraces this, it’s a signal to the world that tokenization has a legitimate seat at the traditional finance table.” Robinhood’s plan includes federally licensed tokenized asset standards, integrated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, and a modified Form S-1 for tokenized securities. The planned Real World Asset Exchange (RRE) would operate on the Solana ( SOL ) and Base blockchains. Last month, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that the tokenization of traditional assets could secure the dominance of the US equities market. “Tokenization of securities, which we’re very excited about, allows you to have ownership in companies… Stablecoins are viewed rightly as an area that could increase demand among individuals overseas as governments become prone to diversifying away from holding treasuries. So in the same way that stablecoin legislation can kind of push forward US dollar dominance, I think tokenized securities can really push forward US company dominance in the global market.” At time of writing, the SEC has yet to issue a formal response.

If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur. Ethereum (ETH) price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag. Ethereum 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000. The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) supports the lower range. The relative strength index (RSI), although still near the overbought region, has significantly cooled over the past few days. An ETH breakout with rising RSI and volume could confirm the bullish move, while a drop below $2,400 risks invalidating the pattern. Can Ether reclaim the Gaussian Channel midline? On May 20, Ether showed a significant trend shift as it attempted to reclaim the mid-line of the 2-week Gaussian Channel, a technical indicator used to identify price trends. The Gaussian or Normal Distribution Channel plots price movements within a dynamic range, adapting to market volatility. Historically, when ETH crosses above this mid-line, significant rallies often follow. In 2023, ETH surged 93% to $4,000 after a similar crossover, while in 2020, it skyrocketed by 1,820%, sparking a massive altcoin rally. Ethereum Gaussian channel analysis. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Conversely, a similar setup in August 2022 led to an invalidation during a market correction, highlighting the risks of relying solely on this indicator. Likewise, crypto trader Merlijn noted a golden cross between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA (simple moving average), which could further strengthen an imminent ETH breakout. It is important to note that the golden cross is on a 12-hour chart, which is less dependable than the one-day chart. Related: Bitcoin fractal analysis forecasts new all-time highs above $110K by end of week Traders exercise caution ahead of possible ‘range-bound environment’ Popular crypto trader XO noted that Ethereum is consolidating under a “decent” resistance level below the $2,800 mark. The trader expects a correction if ETH cannot break above $2,800 over the next few days. The analyst said, “I am leaning toward price carving out a range bound environment for at least several weeks potentially longer, and once again becoming a buyer.” A contrarian outlook to bulls can also be observed with ETH prices oscillating under the Fibonacci levels. Cointelegraph reported that Ether recently retested the 0.5 to 0.618 Fib levels, which could trigger a short-term correction for ETH. In such a scenario, the immediate area of support remains around $2,150 and $1,900, possibly slowing down the bullish momentum for a prolonged period. Ethereum 1-week price analysis.

Last month, John Moolenaar (R-Michigan), the chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, wrote to the CEOs of both banks to express “significant concerns” about their involvement in Contemporary Amperex Technology’s Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO). The firm, known as CATL, is an electric vehicle battery manufacturer, but Moolenaar says it’s also a Communist Party-aligned “Chinese military company” tied to the ongoing persecution of the Uyghur people. “CATL maintains a close, tier-one supplier relationship with the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), a paramilitary entity of the Chinese state that operates forced labor camps and is directly tied to the ongoing genocide of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. XPCC was the foundational entity written into the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and is connected to mass arbitrary detention, severe physical abuse, and other human rights abuses targeting Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the region.” Both JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America (BoA) are underwriting CATL’s IPO, which reportedly raised $4.6 billion.

A popular crypto industry pundit believes the CME futures listing bodes well for a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in 2025. XRP Futures Finish First Day Of Trading Last month, CME confirmed plans to list two types of XRP futures contracts: retail-friendly micro contracts representing 2,500 XRP and standard contracts representing 50,000 XRP. They are the second regulated XRP futures to hit the US market after Coinbase launched XRP and nano XRP futures contracts on its derivatives exchange in April. The newly launched XRP futures are settled in cash, not physical XRP. On May 19, the contracts’ first trading day, 4 standard contracts totaling around $480,000 in notional volume at an average price of $2.40, changed hands on the exchange, according to CME data. The majority of activity came from 106 micro contracts, accounting for over $1 million in day one trading volume. “The launch of regulated XRP Futures on @CMEGroup marks a key institutional milestone for XRP,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated on X on Monday, adding that Hidden Road executed the first block trade. CME already lists futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). US regulators approved exchange-traded funds for both of those cryptocurrencies last year. The rollout of XRP futures on CME comes as efforts to settle the SEC’s protracted lawsuit against Ripple hit a wall in court. As ZyCrypto covered last week, US District Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint request by the two parties to approve a settlement that would have reduced Ripple’s civil penalty from $125 million to $50 million. Calling it “procedurally improper,” Judge Torres indicated that the motion did not satisfy Rule 60, which only allows relief from a final judgment under exceptional circumstances. The ruling keeps Ripple’s legal woes alive and adds uncertainty over the timeline for spot XRP ETF approvals. ETF Approval Odds ETF Store Nate Geraci has expressed optimism about XRP’s next big move after the launch of the highly anticipated CME XRP futures. Amid the buzz surrounding this significant development, Geraci reckons that U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are next in line. His remark suggests that the launch of the CFTC-regulated futures will act as a stepping stone for XRP to secure regulatory approval for spot products.

More and more companies are rolling out advancements in cross-chain bridges. On Tuesday, May 20, Zeus Network, a cross-chain communications layer for Bitcoin and Solana, implemented Chainlink CCIP. This widely adopted standard for bridging crypto assets now enables users to transfer Bitcoin to Solana securely. Users can now move Zeus’s Bitcoin-backed token, zBTC, across Ethereum, Base, and Solana. All zBTC tokens are backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, which users can verify in real time using Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve. You might also like: Blockchain Bridges: What Are They & How Do They Work? According to Zeus Network founder and CEO Justin Wang, this integration is key to addressing longstanding security concerns with cross-chain transfers. Cross-chain bridges are often centralized, exposing users to risks such as hacks and rug pulls. “Wrapped BTC tokens are flawed because they aren’t decentralized — many of them still require KYC, have third-party entities involved in the trading, and ultimately take control away from the user. The Chainlink standard enables this to solve these issues and provide an enhanced experience for our users,” Justin Wang, Zeus Network. You might also like: Hacken: Access control exploits account for nearly 80% of all crypto hacks in 2024 Bitcoin liquidity is now available on Solana Wang emphasized that the integration gives Bitcoin users a decentralized way to access DeFi on Solana, while also bringing Bitcoin liquidity to the Solana ecosystem. “zBTC offers users a truly decentralized Bitcoin asset compatible with the Solana ecosystem, now able to be easily transferred across the most widely used chains thanks to our integration of Chainlink CCIP. We are excited to unlock the vast liquidity potential for DeFi on Solana by leveraging Chainlink, powered entirely by Bitcoin,” Justin Wang, Zeus Network. Zeus Network is not the only firm that recently integrated Chainlink CCIP. For instance, in April, Ronin, one of the most popular blockchain bridges, moved its legacy bridge to Chainlink’s standard.

He argues that these traditional forms of money are better shields against what he calls “mounting financial risks.” Kiyosaki has issued a fresh warning that an economic turmoil could be on the horizon. He points to the US departure from the gold standard in 1971 as the seed of ongoing instability. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight Bitcoin: Signs From Past Crises According to Kiyosaki, the Long‑Term Capital Management event in 1998 and the Wall Street crash in 2008 were early warnings.

He warns that central banks may soon hit their limits. He points out that unlimited cash printing erodes trust in currency, making it hard for banks and governments to rely on the same old playbook. In his words, “You can’t borrow or print your way out of an endless pile of debt.” That debt, he says, is growing every day. Student Loans As Potential Trigger According to the warning, US student loan debt ranks high on his list of danger signs. He sees it as a ticking time bomb that could trigger serious credit shocks. He’s not alone: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that widespread defaults could unsettle credit markets. Economist James Rickards shares the view, arguing that mass non‑payments may shake the financial system more than commercial real estate or corporate bankruptcies. Growing Interest In Bitcoin And Precious Metals Based on his comments, more people are eyeing Bitcoin, gold and silver as lifeboats. He notes that Bitcoin’s capped supply gives it an edge over fiat money, which can be printed in endless batches. He contrasts a fixed 21 million‑coin limit with the unchecked growth of government debt. Gold and silver, with centuries of use as money, also win points because they can’t be created by a keyboard.

These customers included well-known people in the tech field. Cybercriminals bribed customer service reps in other countries to get access to sensitive user data without permission. The hackers tried to force Coinbase to pay $20 million in Bitcoin over stolen customer data, but the exchange refused. Coinbase revealed this on Thursday. Instead, the company offered a $20 million reward for any information to help catch and convict the attackers. Michael Arrington accuses Coinbase of using the cheapest option for customer service Michael Arrington said regulators should think again about the importance of “know-your-customer” (KYC). He added, “Very disappointed in Coinbase right now. Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price. And Coinbase’s customers will bear that cost.” He also said that problems like these will keep happening because of KYC and other laws that make it easy for hackers to get away with their crimes. He added that the government and businesses need to do something to stop this. However, Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of Coinbase, disagreed with Arrington’s view that leaders should be punished. He said regulators are forcing KYC on companies that don’t want to do it. Crypto kidnappings are on the rise Digital assets are increasingly linked to real-world heists. It reminds investors why keeping crypto private is essential. Last November, three teens kidnapped a man in Las Vegas after a crypto event he put on and held him hostage at his home with a gun. He was pushed into a car and taken out into the desert. Attackers got into his crypto wallets and stole $4 million worth of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This year also has a share of kidnappings. In January, a group of thieves broke into the home of David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, in Vierzon, France. They took Balland and his wife hostage, beat them up, and cut off one of Balland’s fingers to get to his crypto wallet keys. After the attack, the thieves called another co-founder of Ledger and demanded a ransom. Police arrested 10 suspects.

2025-05-20T18:54:58.000Z,"Bitcoin Remains Stable as Spot Market Leads Derivatives in Inflows","The recent bitcoin (BTC) rally has been characterised by a series of impulsive moves and well-defined consolidation phases. However, one thing that stood out during the surge was the active participation of spot traders. According to the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report , BTC has been through a period of aggressive buying in the spot market. In contrast, traders in the derivatives market were caught relatively offside. Spot Market Leads Derivatives Since mid-April, the market has witnessed significant net spot buying across most trading platforms. This is evident in the Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which measures the net difference between aggressive buys and sells. Bitfinex analysts said CVD across major centralized exchanges peaked at more than $45 million per day. The surge aligned with bitcoin’s rally from $75,000 to above $104,000, with buying pressure building gradually before each breakout. This has reflected genuine demand rather than speculative derivatives activity, indicating that the rally is “built on solid ground” and supported by real capital flows. Although BTC is consolidating now, analysts insist the asset needs this pattern of spot buyer dominance to navigate key resistance levels near its all-time high. The Middle of a Mature Bull Market On the other hand, the derivatives market has been cautious and reactive, as seen in the Spot Premium. This metric shows the difference between the Bitcoin spot price and the average of seven perpetuals and futures market prices. The Spot Premium has been positive since BTC crossed $80,000 in this rally. Moreover, open interest in perpetual futures contracts has been contracting, reflecting a short squeeze as traders are compelled to unwind their bearish positions. While the market transitions from bearish to bullish, traders betting against bitcoin’s price surge have been caught off guard and liquidated with excess leverage flushed out of the system. “The presence of back-to-back squeezes, on both sides of the trade, underscores a critical point: the rally appears to be maturing in a constructive fashion. The clearing out of over-leveraged participants has reset market positioning and created a healthier foundation for continuation,” analysts said. These market dynamics are often seen during the early stages of a sustained bullish move. Analysts tagged it as the alignment of spot accumulation and derivatives market clean-up. With bitcoin’s surge now standing on firmer footing, the market is moving from speculative leverage towards structural buying, as is expected in the middle of a mature bull market.

2025-05-20T18:45:14.000Z,"Lawyers for Tornado Cash Developer Say Federal Prosecutors Withheld Critical Evidence From Court","Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm’s legal team is accusing the government of withholding information from the court. Storm was arrested in 2023 and slapped with charges related to allegedly laundering $1 billion in criminal proceeds, including hundreds of millions of dollars for the Lazarus Group, the sanctioned North Korean cybercriminal outfit. The Tornado Cash founder was also charged with operating an unregistered money-transmitting business, though that part of the indictment was dropped earlier this month in accordance with an April Department of Justice (DOJ) memo that encouraged an end to digital asset “regulation by prosecution.” The prosecutors are still pursuing the other charges. Now, Storm’s lawyers claim government prosecutors have held onto exculpatory materials since 2023 regarding their claims that noncustodial crypto mixers can act as money transmitters. “A recent filing in a similar prosecution involving Samourai Wallet, a noncustodial cryptocurrency mixer, revealed that, on August 23, 2023, S.D.N.Y. prosecutors had a previously undisclosed call with senior officials from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)… During that call, FinCEN officials stated that because Samourai ‘did not take ‘custody’ of the cryptocurrency by possessing the private keys to any addresses where the cryptocurrency is stored, that would strongly suggest that Samourai is NOT (emphasis in original) acting as an MSB [money services business/money transmitting business].'” Even though the government has dropped the unregistered money-transmitter portion of the indictment, Storm’s lawyers still claim that the failure to disclose those documents constitutes a “Brady violation” and has “materially prejudiced” the Tornado Cash founder’s defense. Brady violations involve prosecutors failing to disclose pertinent evidence that would help a defendant’s case. They can result in conviction reversals, mistrials, charge dismissals and/or prosecutorial misconduct charges. Storm’s trial is scheduled for July 14th.

2025-05-20T18:44:08.000Z,"Analyst Warns: “Bitcoin’s Record High Has No Meaning, Focus on This Level Instead”","Cryptocurrency analyst James Van Straten has shared a remarkable analysis of Bitcoin's recent price movements. Van Straten argues that the record highs in question — $20,000 in 2017, $69,000 in 2021 and $109,000 in 2025 — do not accurately reflect investors’ profitability and market sentiment. Instead, he points out that the metric known as “realized price” is much more meaningful. According to Van Straten, the realized price represents the average purchase cost of Bitcoins withdrawn from all exchanges and is used to understand the general cost base of the market. The average realized price for 2025 is $93,266. The current price of Bitcoin, around $105,000, shows that investors are making an average profit of around 12%. After reaching a peak of $109,000 in late January, Bitcoin fell and briefly fell below its 2025 realized price. This is historically interpreted as a “capitulation” signal. Van Straten notes that this period of stress lasted until April 22, after which Bitcoin regained this critical cost floor. Related News: JUST IN: Argentina's President Makes Another Controversial Move Related to the LIBRA Cryptocurrency Scandal He Is Involved In The analyst explains how such moves provide critical signals for market cycles, citing examples from past years: 2024: Following ETF approval, Bitcoin falls to $49,000 after falling below its average cost floor, amid a decline in Japanese yen carry trades during the summer. 2023: Except for a brief dip during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in March, the price has generally traded above its cost floor. Van Straten said that in the 2017 bull market, the large difference between the market price and the realized price represented excessive speculation, whereas in the 2018 bear market, the price reconciled with this metric, suggesting that the realized price acts as a kind of “floor support” in bear markets. Finally, Van Straten notes that the realized price has continued to rise over time, and that by looking at this metric, Bitcoin has not only reached record levels, but has also become a maturing asset class over the long term. According to the analyst, this indicates that capital commitment to the network is increasing and the market is gaining a deeper structure. “Instead of focusing on peak prices, it is much more important to track investors’ profitability over the total cost base to understand where Bitcoin is heading,” the analyst said. *This is not investment advice.

KKR, which had over $360 billion in assets under management as of the end of last year, says government bonds have ceased to act as “shock absorbers” for investors, Bloomberg reports . Says Henry McVey, KKR’s head of global macro and asset allocation, “During risk off days, government bonds are no longer fulfilling their role as the ‘shock absorbers’ in a traditional portfolio… Many CIOs are considering moving assets out of the United States toward other parts of the world.” McVey also says that the US dollar is about 15% overvalued, and that a weaker greenback is most likely approaching as President Trump’s new trade agenda develops. “The traditional role of U.S. government bonds in many global portfolios will become more diminished… The reality is that the US government is burdened with a large fiscal deficit and high leverage, and its bonds are likely over-owned by many global investors who have benefited from both positive interest rate differentials and a strong US dollar.” Last week, Moody’s downgraded America’s credit rating from AAA to AA1 while changing the country’s outlook from negative to stable. Moody’s attributes the downgrade to the United States’ soaring national debt and interest payment ratios that exceed those of other countries with the same credit rating. “As deficits and debt have grown, and interest rates have risen, interest payments on government debt have increased markedly. Without adjustments to taxation and spending, we expect budget flexibility to remain limited, with mandatory spending, including interest expense, projected to rise to around 78% of total spending by 2035 from about 73% in 2024. If the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is extended, which is our base case, it will add around $4 trillion to the federal fiscal primary (excluding interest payments) deficit over the next decade.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-20T18:37:07.000Z,"How German Government Missed Out On $2.3 Billion Profits By Selling Its Bitcoin Stash Too Early","The German government offloaded its Bitcoin holdings in 2024, which became a costly mistake. The price of the benchmark crypto has now soared past the $106,000 mark, costing Europe’s largest economy an estimated $2.3 billion in missed profits. Germany Missed Out On $2.35 Billion The German gov’t sold 49,858 Bitcoins during the summer of 2024 as part of the plan to offload Bitcoin seized from the now-defunct film piracy website Movie2k. The average price of the sale was $57,900 per coin. According to data provided by Arkham Intelligence, Germany could have amassed far greater profits by holding onto its BTC stash a tad longer. Bitcoin’s price rebounded above the psychologically important $60,000 level on July 14, a day after the German government ran out of BTC, dispelling investor fears about additional selling pressure. The price of Bitcoin jumped over 80% since the sale, trading hands at $106,306 as of press time. Arkham noted that the decision to sell the BTC early cost the German government a potential $2.35 billion in missed profit. “If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24B. Opportunity cost: $2.35 Billion,” the blockchain intelligence firm wrote on X. US Government Misses Out On $20 Billion The German government isn’t the only one that has missed out on potential gains by selling Bitcoin too early. According to data from Case CSO Jameson Lopp’s U.S. government sales tracker, the United States government has offloaded different amounts of Bitcoin in 11 auctions over the last decade. The tracker reveals that the U.S. government has sold 195,091.75 BTC over the years, raking in a total of $366.5 million. But at current market prices, that hoard would have been worth over $20 billion — resulting in an opportunity cost of around $20.3 billion. However, President Trump adopted a different approach after taking office in January. In March, he signed an Executive Order authorizing the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve with BTC owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal forfeiture proceedings. Moreover, the recently reintroduced Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act of 2025 by Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis would allow the US to potentially hold more than 1 million Bitcoin in its reserves if signed into law.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/how-german-government-missed-out-on-2-3-billion-profits-by-selling-its-bitcoin-stash-too-early/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Germany",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T18:30:49.000Z,"Jack Dorsey Backs Radical Bitcoin Overhaul: Why Your ‘Satoshis’ Could Soon Become ‘Bitcoins","Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, endorsed BIP 177, which proposes a radical rebranding of Bitcoin’s base unit. Dorsey supported the proposal on X and spread the new idea with 1 million views. A software developer, John Carvalho, published BIP 177 titled “Refine Bitcoin’s Base Unit”, arguing that the BTC currency could be simplified by removing leading zeros and the decimal point. Using current prices, A single Bitcoin worth over $100,000 makes the token cumbersome for regular trade. A Bitcoin comprises 100,000,000 Satoshis, or “sats”, named after the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. BIP 177 proposes to redefine 1 Bitcoin as the base unit of BTC, instead of the Satoshi or “sat” value, effectively removing the decimal place system and creating a more conventional system that resembles fiat systems. BIP 177 argued that a more readable system would make Bitcoin more comprehensible for new users. The change in base values to Bitcoins would align the currency with the underlying architecture, which is not a decimal-based system. The base value, called Bitcoins or Satoshis, represents the underlying technology and can be experimented with, switching between new and legacy systems without affecting the blockchain. The author of BIP 177 also criticised the “bits” proposal, suggesting that the alternate system is confusing and does not improve a user’s experience. BIP 177 suggests a phase-based transition, with both new and legacy systems being used side by side until the general public gets used to the discrete representation. An education campaign could be created to help people understand the new system. BIP 177 concludes that a discrete system of Bitcoins would better represent the underlying technology, which is discrete rather than fractional, and would enhance the continuity between blockchain technology and currency representations. The proposal would refer to Satoshis as Bitcoins, changing the way traders represent the price of Bitcoin. For example, if BIP were adopted, 0.00001234 BTC would be defined as ₿1,234, which would be described as 1,234 Bitcoin. Carvalho insists that such a change will make Bitcoin easier to comprehend. Carvalho has been accused of creating the system for ‘normies’ who may want a currency to look like fiat. But Carvalho says he wants to enhance continuity between the underlying technology and its representation. Dorsey referenced a December 2024 discussion by Stevie Lee about the confused use of Satoshis, highlighting the need to change the base currency. Lee pointed out that most people didn’t know what a Satoshi was, and may even think it was a different token. Dorsey concluded that Bitcoins should be referred to as Bitcoins, rather than Satoshis, to avoid ambiguity. He reasoned that people don’t want to think about what a Satoshi is, but want to transfer Bitcoins. The change may be difficult initially, but will be easier in the long run. Critics of the proposal, however, suggest that the changes are merely cosmetic and don’t dispel confusion about a currency’s fractional nature. The bit proposal, an alternate to BIP 177, creates a hybrid model that includes fractional elements. For example, 1 Bitcoin equals 1 million bits, and 1 bit equals 100 Satoshis. Using a back-of-the-envelope analysis, the system means that a price of $100,000 per Bitcoin (to simplify matters) would equal $100,000/1,000,000 bits, giving us a value of $0.1 per bit. That would mean $1 equals $1/0.1 bits, or $1 equals 10 bits. Therefore, using a current market price of $103,000 per Bitcoin, $103,000/1,000,000 bits would equal 0.103, which means $1 would roughly equal 9.7 bits (rounded off to one decimal place). The bit system further suggests that “sats” sounds very similar to “cents”, which may confuse traders further. Satoshi Nakamoto suggested that the decimal point could be shifted if the value becomes too big. This seems more similar to the bit method than the BIP 177 proposal, as the former uses a fractional system.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/jack-dorsey-backs-radical-bitcoin-overhaul-why-your-satoshis-could-soon-become-bitcoins/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Jack Dorsey",cryptocompare
2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassThe total open interest in BTC futures climbed to $72 billion on May 20, marking an 8% increase from $66.6 billion just a week earlier.

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC. There is little doubt that institutional buying remains the primary catalyst for Bitcoin to break above the $108,000 level. Such a move would trigger the liquidation of heavily leveraged bearish positions, likely accelerating the push to a new all-time high. However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The analyst said,“I am leaning toward price carving out a range bound environment for at least several weeks potentially longer, and once again becoming a buyer.”A contrarian outlook to bulls can also be observed with ETH prices oscillating under the Fibonacci levels.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator.

Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.”India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators.

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T03:08:27.000Z,"SEC’s Crenshaw says agency playing ‘regulatory Jenga’ with crypto","The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s sole Democratic Commissioner has said the agency is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga” with its approach to the crypto industry and market regulation under the Trump administration. In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions.

Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19.Alpenglow consists of Votor, which processes voting transactions and block finalization logic, and Rotor, a data dissemination protocol that would replace Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping system and aim to reduce the time it takes for all nodes to agree on the network state.Source: AnzaAnza researchers claimed that “Alpenglow will shatter both these latency bounds” and the project expects it to reach actual finality in about 150 milliseconds, rivaling internet infrastructure.“A median latency of 150 [milliseconds] does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance.”Votor — which would replace TowerBFT — would aim to finalize blocks in a single round if 80% of the stake is participating, and in two rounds if only 60% of the stake is responsive.Related: DeFi lender Aave reaches $40B in value locked onchainThese two voting modes are integrated and run concurrently, with finalization taking place as soon as the faster of the two paths terminates.Anza’s researchers claimed this model would result in “unprecedented finalization latency” while enabling it to operate more effectively under “harsh network conditions.”Alpenglow won’t fix Solana’s network outagesThe project’s white paper noted that switching to Alpenglow wouldn’t completely shield Solana from the network outages that it has experienced in the past.Solana currently only has one production-ready client, Agave, meaning any security vulnerability in Agave can disrupt the entire Solana network.However, a new independent validator client called Firedancer is set to launch on Solana’s mainnet sometime this year, which will provide client diversification for the network.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-labs-offshoot-anza-consensus-protocol-alpenglow?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility.The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio. Source: X.comFrom an allocation standpoint, Timmer recommended a 4:1 gold-to-Bitcoin ratio for a store-of-value hedge, highlighting an intriguing observation. Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!”While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic newsletter, pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated,“Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison.

The report uses a scenario-based framework rooted in its gold model to project Bitcoin’s potential revaluation as a non-sovereign hard asset. If Bitcoin’s network value, measured in gold, follows a power curve, and gold maintains its current value, analysts suggest it could hit $444,000 in 2025.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million.

Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22. The Democratic Party’s arm in Arlington, Virginia, announced its members would gather to oppose those in the White House “cashing in on their public office.” Cointelegraph reached out to the organization for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Buying influence, or just speculating on an emerging market?The top 220 tokenholders reportedly spent a combined $148 million to have the opportunity to attend the event, which finalized its leaderboard on May 12. However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China.

Source: Coin360Although Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish, repeated failure to break above the overhead resistance may tempt short-term traders to book profits. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological level of $100,000.What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its up move last week, indicating continued buying by the bulls.SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support. That opens the doors for a retest of the 99 level.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin broke above the overhead resistance at $105,820 on May 18, but the bulls could not sustain the momentum.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA ($100,787) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support. The pair could then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($91,916).Ether price predictionEther’s (ETH) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($2,288) on May 18 fizzled out near $2,600, signaling that the bears have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart.

There is minor resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then slump to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe XRP/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($2.34) on May 17, but the bulls are facing selling at higher levels. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the pair could stay inside the range for some more time. The price action inside the range is expected to be random and volatile.The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2.65 or below $2. If buyers pierce the $2.65 resistance, the pair could travel to $3.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($635) on May 18, but the higher levels attracted selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls. If the price rises and maintains above $644, the bulls will again try to drive the BNB/USDT pair above $680. If they succeed, the pair may start its northward march toward the overhead resistance of $745.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA clears the path for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($606) and later to $580.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($163) on May 17, but the bulls could not push the price above the $180 resistance.SOL/USDT daily chart.

If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could tumble to $153 and, after that, to the 50-day SMA ($143). That points to a possible range-bound action between $180 and $120 in the near term.The bulls will have to propel the price above the $185 level to regain control. The pair could then pick up momentum and rally to $210 and subsequently to $220. Related: XRP price risks falling to $2 after classic bearish chart pattern confirmsDogecoin price predictionBuyers successfully defended the breakout level of $0.21 on May 17 but are struggling to sustain the bounce in Dogecoin (DOGE).DOGE/USDT daily chart.

That signals a possible range formation between $0.26 and $0.14.Buyers will have to thrust the price above the $0.26 resistance to signal the resumption of the recovery. There is minor resistance at $0.30, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then ascend to $0.35.Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) has broken below the neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating that the bulls are losing their grip.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe next support is at the 50-day SMA ($0.68). If the price turns up from the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the ADA/USDT pair above the neckline. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the $0.86 level. A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe pullback could deepen if the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the SUI/USDT pair could skid to $3.12 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.97).On the contrary, if the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA and rises above $3.90, it suggests a positive sentiment. That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $5 and the all-time high of $5.37.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus. Source: CointelegraphThis was part of the motivation behind launching Ledn, a Cayman Islands-based company that gives Bitcoin holders the ability to access dollar liquidity without having to sell their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” said di Bartolomeo, adding:“This creates a bit of a virtuous cycle that we see happen time and again with real estate, with borrowing against your stock, borrowing against your gold, and so Bitcoin is no different.”Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execCrypto lending market on the riseLedn operates in a much broader crypto lending industry that has grown over the past five years due to the rapid appreciation of Bitcoin, the arrival of institutional investors and the growing utility of stablecoins.By the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto lending market was valued at $30.2 billion, a more than threefold increase compared to two years earlier, according to Galaxy Research. However, the size of the overall industry remains below the 2021 peak. The researchers attributed the recent rise to decentralized finance applications, which allow users to borrow against assets onchain.

Ripple Payments is a platform that combines stablecoins, cryptocurrency, and fiat to enable payments and quick settlement times, a feature of Web3 that cross-border traditional finance payment systems often lack. Ripple was licensed to offer crypto payments by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March.Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, said acquiring this license “enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, such as high fees, long settlement times, and lack of transparency, in one of the world’s largest cross-border payments hubs.”Related: Ripple, Chipper Cash partner for faster and cheaper African remittancesUAE ranked 56 out of 151 countries for crypto adoptionChainalysis, a blockchain data platform, ranked the United Arab Emirates 56th out of 151 countries for crypto adoption, according to a 2024 report.

The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin could face continued pressure in the short term as investors pivot to safer assets amid rising uncertainty and borrowing costs.However, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. on X highlighted a shift in market sentiment, noting that traders betting on price declines have been “significantly more cautious” in building short positions during this bull cycle compared to 2021. This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Source: BinanceThe UAE also provides its own incentives, such as no personal income tax and free zones like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) offer 0% corporate tax advantages and 100% foreign ownership.Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearingsCrypto firms have reported easier access to banking services in Dubai, which is an improvement over the challenges companies say they’ve faced in the US under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”Hong Kong makes crypto hub push with retail access and staking ETFsHong Kong has long acted as a financial gateway to mainland China, where crypto activities like mining and trading remain banned.Previously, the city had a voluntary licensing regime, when only OSL and HashKey were licensed to serve institutions and professional investors. In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market. As of now, 10 platforms are licensed, while 15 have either withdrawn or been rejected.Eight applicants in Hong Kong still wait the SFC’s decision. Source: Securities and Futures CommissionHong Kong has made further strides with the listing of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) ETFs, and recently approved staking within Ether ETFs, which is not yet permitted in the US. It has also introduced stablecoin sandboxes under the supervision of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to trial approved digital assets in a controlled environment.“Sandboxes are an experiment, so too are staking ETFs,” said Kelvin Koh, a Spartan Group co-founder. “The key point is that these experiments are happening in Hong Kong.”Hong Kong recently released its ASPIRe roadmap in February 2025, which aims to foster blockchain innovation and fill regulatory gaps to set the city up as a global crypto hub.Hong Kong’s five-pillar strategy to become a crypto hub.

As Arvin Abraham, partner at law firm Goodwin’s private equity group, told Cointelegraph, crypto was once central to Sunak’s competitiveness agenda, but under the current Labour government, that focus has faded.The new Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, spearheaded by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, highlights fintech as a priority without a focus solely on crypto.“The UK does not feel like it’s prioritizing it as much as it was a few years ago,” Abraham said.In January, Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its UK office to move back to the US. Source: Anthony AlbaneseAbraham added the UK remains “one of the best places to set up a new startup,” especially for early-stage capital raising. He points to generous tax incentives for angel investors and the unique convergence of finance and startups in London, calling it “probably one of the best cities in the world for fintech-type businesses.” In that sense, even without headline-grabbing crypto policy, the UK’s structural appeal still draws Web3 firms — just now with a quieter backdrop.Magazine: South Africa’s digital-nomad crypto hub: Cape Town, Crypto City Guide",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cash-code-crypto-hub-uk-us-singapore?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The company reportedly used USB drivers to distribute malware-ridden drivers and uploaded the compromised software to cloud storage for global download.A total of 9.3 BTC worth over $953,000 have been stolen, according to the report. Crypto tracking and compliance firm Slow Mist described how the malware operates in a May 19 X post:“The official driver provided by this printer carries a backdoor program. It will hijack the wallet address in the user’s clipboard and replace it with the attacker's address.“Source: MistTrackRelated: Massive supply chain attack targeting small number of crypto companies: KasperskyYouTuber flags malware in Procolored driversLandian News recommended users who downloaded Procolored printer drivers in the past six months to “immediately perform a full system scan using antivirus software.” Still, given the hit or miss nature of antivirus software, a full system reset is always the better option when in doubt:“Ideally, you should reinstall your operating system and thoroughly check old files.“The issue was allegedly first reported by YouTuber Cameron Coward, whose antivirus software detected malware in the drivers while testing a Procolored UV printer. The software flagged the drive as containing a worm and a trojan virus named Foxif.Related: Coinbase faces $400M bill after insider phishing attackCybersecurity company confirms crypto-stealing malwareWhen contacted, Procolored denied the claims and dismissed the antivirus tool flagging the drivers as a false positive. Coward turned to Reddit, where he shared the issue with cybersecurity professionals, attracting the attention of cybersecurity firm G-Data.G-Data’s investigation found that most of Procolored’s drivers were hosted on the file hosting service MEGA, with uploads as old as October 2023. Analysis of those files confirmed that they were compromised by two distinct pieces of malware: backdoor Win32.Backdoor.XRedRAT.A and a crypto stealer designed to substitute addresses in the clipboard with those controlled by the attacker.G-Data contacted Procolored, with the hardware producer saying it deleted the infected drivers from its storage on May 8 and re-scanned all files. Procolored attributed the malware to a supply chain compromise, stating that the malicious files were introduced through infected USB devices before being uploaded online.Related: Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-stealer-malware-found-in-official-printer-drivers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T14:00:00.000Z,"Franklin taps blockchain to offer yield on idle payroll funds","Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi’s audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.Related: How to Use tsUSDe on TON for Passive Dollar Yield in 2025Rising interest in yield-generating strategiesInterest in yield-generating strategies within the cryptocurrency sector has surged in recent years, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking to maximize returns on their digital assets.On May 16, Solv Protocol launched a yield-bearing Bitcoin token on the Avalanche blockchain, giving institutional investors more exposure to yield opportunities backed by real-world assets, or RWAs.On May 1, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, said the demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/franklin-launches-payroll-treasury-yield-defi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
