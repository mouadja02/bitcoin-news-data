2025-05-21T15:52:11.000Z,"The Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Explained and What BSR Means for the US Economy","The United States government is considering alternative “budget neutral” methods of funding its new bitcoin strategic reserve, creating lots of excitement worldwide in the cryptocurrency world. The radical shift in monetary policy—a reserve supply of bitcoin—dramatically changes how the U.S. approaches financial negotiations. This all comes after President Donald Trump's Executive Order of March 6, which established the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. His order put a freeze on any further sales of the U.S. 's bitcoin—a move some feel could ensure the U.S. becoming the dominant force in the worldwide cryptocurrency market. Our comprehensive analysis goes back to the origins of the U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve: we examine the economic rationale for the reserve and its potential implications. We also explore the legislative framework, its funding mechanisms, and the macroeconomic impact of the U.S.’s groundbreaking bitcoin initiative. There’s also some key concerns the reserve raises, and it has some limitations to consider. Let’s go! The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Origins and Legislative Framework Legislative efforts beginning back in mid-2024, mark both the origins of the bitcoin strategic reserve, and an incredibly significant shift in how the U.S. government views and handles digital assets. Unlike current traditional monetary policies, the bitcoin initiative represents a deliberate attempt to integrate cryptocurrency into the national financial strategy. The BITCOIN Act of 2024 and its core provisions Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming introduced The Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act in 2024, establishing the foundation for the U.S.’s national bitcoin policy. Her legislation aims to create a comprehensive framework for management of government bitcoin holdings by authorizing multiple key provisions: Establishment of a decentralized network of secure bitcoin storage facilities spread across multiple U.S. locations Implementation of purchasing program to purchase 200,000 over five years, totaling 1 million Acquisition of approximately 5% of the world’s total bitcoin supply—a goal mirroring U.S. gold reserves’ percentile Funding by diversifying existing resources already within the Federal Reserve System Protection of the rights of bitcoin holders to self-custody their asset without a third party Additionally, the legislation mandated that quarterly reports via an auditing practice known as \""proof of reserves\"" are maintained, which is to ensure transparency and accountability of government-held bitcoin’s management. Furthermore, the sale of bitcoin under federal control became prohibited by Trump’s March 6 executive order, requiring all bitcoin to be transferred to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve once legal title has been secured. President Trump's executive order and political motivations When Trump formalized the bitcoin strategic reserve via signature on the executive order titled \""Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,” the order directed the Treasury Department to establish an office to administer the reserve. Bitcoin seized through criminal and civil asset forfeiture proceedings and currently held by the government formed the strategic reserve’s initial capital. Trump’s executive order contained several key directives: Government-owned bitcoin would not be sold, but instead held as a reserve asset Both the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments were authorized to develop \""budget-neutral\"" strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin without tax dollars All federal agencies were required to provide a complete accounting of digital assets in their possession within 30 days A separate \""Digital Asset Stockpile\"" would be created for cryptocurrencies and digital assets other than bitcoin The initiative moves towards fulfillment of Trump’s various cryptocurrency-related campaign promises, including to make America \""the undisputed bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world.\"" According to Trump's digital assets advisor, aka “Crypto Czar David Sacks, previous government sales of approximately 195,000 bitcoin have cost taxpayers an estimated $17 billion in lost value. The reserve now represents an attempt to transform this perceived mismanagement into strategic advantage. Role of Senator Cynthia Lummis and state-level initiatives A years-long bitcoin advocate, Senator Cynthia Lummis emerged as the primary congressional spokesperson and champion of the bitcoin strategic reserve. She reintroduced the BITCOIN Act following Trump’s executive order to codify the initiative into permanent law. Lummis framed the reserve as addressing America's \""$36 trillion national debt\"" and strengthening the country's \""economic foundation for generations.\"" State-level initiatives are also gaining momentum. By early 2025, twenty-eight states had proposed allocating public funds to bitcoin, with eighteen actively progressing through legislative channels 6. Notable examples include: Texas: Considering Senate Bill 21 to create a state-managed investment fund for Bitcoin and high market cap cryptocurrencies 7 Kentucky: Enacted legal protections for Bitcoin users, exempting node operators from money transmitter licensing 6 Arizona: Advanced its Bitcoin Reserve Bill through the House Committee 6 Oklahoma: Passed House Bill 1203 establishing a state Bitcoin reserve by a 77-15 vote 6 The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal, operating under the authority of the state Comptroller, would be financed through legislative appropriations, dedicated revenue sources, and private donations 7. This initiative reflects growing interest in cryptocurrency as a potential hedge against inflation and economic volatility at both federal and state levels. Economic Rationale Behind a Bitcoin Reserve Beyond politics, economic justification for the bitcoin strategic reserve rests on three main ideas: inflation protection, reserve diversification, and debt reduction. These aspects form the foundation of what proponents describe as a forward-thinking monetary strategy. Bitcoin as a deflationary hedge against inflation The core economic rationale behind the bitcoin strategic reserve lies in its inherent design as a deflationary asset. With a permanently capped supply of 21 million, bitcoin stands in stark contrast to traditional fiat currency, which gets printed indefinitely, causing inflation. This artificial digital scarcity gives bitcoin intrinsic value and positions it as a potential shield against price and dollar depreciation. The only potential caveat at the moment, is how long it takes Bitcoin to send and receive , with some estimators ranging from 1 to 1.5 hours. Bitcoin's deflationary mechanisms, including a fixed supply and halving events reducing its issuance totals, make it resistant to inflationary norms. Bitcoin is widely considered a viable store of value, just like gold. Being a digital asset with proven scarcity and this hard limit means bitcoin could increase its value as demand rises worldwide, a counterbalance to the declining purchasing power of fiat currencies. Bitcoin notably operates independently of geopolitical tension and the economic policies typically affecting traditional assets. This independence provides a unique security layer for national reserves during periods of inflation, economic uncertainty or currency debasement. Diversification of U.S. national reserves For the federal reserve, bitcoin represents the opportunity to extend its portfolio beyond traditional assets like gold and foreign currencies. Diversifying into bitcoin offers the nation enhanced economic resilience through exposure to different asset classes, each of course with varying risk profiles. Holding, or “hodling,” bitcoin follows the same logic as maintaining national gold reserves, foreign currencies, and other assets. However, bitcoin offers many distinct advantages: 24/7 market liquidity, fast cross-border transactions, and lower transaction costs make bitcoin a highly flexible reserve asset 1. Despite its volatility, bitcoin's value has surged over 10,000% since inception, consistently outperforming every other traditional asset in existence. This growth potential makes bitcoin an attractive addition to the federal reserve bitcoin strategy, and some suggest it could be used to strengthen the dollar's role as the world’s reserve currency. Potential to reduce long-term federal debt burden Perhaps the most compelling reason for the reserve is bitcoin's potential impact on the U.S.’s national debt. Asset management firm VanEck projects that the U.S. establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve could cut the national debt by up to 35% by 2049. $42 trillion of the projected $119.3 trillion national debt in 2049 could be offset through this strategy, according to estimates from the firm. Optimistic assessments continue to come from Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) who believes a strategic bitcoin reserve could cut the national debt in half by 2045—a projection which aligns with analysis suggesting that if bitcoin growth continues to be strong, by 2045 the U.S. Treasury could reduce its federal debt by as much as $50.8 trillion. The mechanism for this debt reduction could involve innovative financial instruments like \""BitBonds,\"" which would allow the government to finance debt for around 1% interest instead, opposed to the typical 4.5% for 10-year Treasury notes—a shift which would translate to roughly $70 billion in savings annually, or $700 billion in the first decade. The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve represents more than a technological initiative, but proof of a burgeoning economic paradigm shift. Bitcoin offers inflation protection, reserve diversification, plus a pathway toward addressing America's substantial debt—all without taxpayers footing the bill. Materials and Methods: Funding and Acquisition Strategy The bitcoin strategic reserve seeks out novel ways to acquire the asset without placing any further burden on the taxpayers. The U.S. government was previously said to be holding approximately 200,000 bitcoin, worth roughly $18.5 billion, primarily obtained through law enforcement seizures. A scheduled audit of the government’s holdings has to date failed to materialize, and the held bitcoin may have suffered mismanagement by various parties unfamiliar with the technology, but whatever remains of the existing stockpile forms the foundation for an ambitious expansion plan. Use of seized crypto assets by federal agencies Several federal agencies have historically auctioned off any seized cryptocurrency assets, placing the sales’ proceeds into the Department of Justice’s Asset Forfeiture Fund. The establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has changed this approach dramatically, as the executive order mandates that all cryptocurrency seized through criminal or civil forfeiture proceedings must now be transferred to the Treasury Department instead of the general fund where it had normally been flowing to eventually. The U.S. Marshals Service previously managed the auctions of similarly forfeited assets in the past—like artwork, vehicles, etc. This fragmented approach, however, led to several inefficiencies: The captured digital assets were scattered across multiple federal agencies among people who may not have been familiar with the new technology. The reserve’s new centralized management structure addresses these issues, originally by requiring agencies to provide a complete accounting of all of the varying digital assets each had in their possession within 30 days. To date however, the accounting of the nation’s bitcoin is still a grey area. Annual acquisition cap of 200,000 BTC The BITCOIN Act proposed by Senator Lummis calls for a “structured acquisition program” targeting the purchase of 200,000 bitcoin per year over the next five years. This carefully calibrated approach aims to accumulate 1 million bitcoin in total. If successful, these acquisitions would leave the U.S. holding about 5% of all bitcoin that can ever exist. To implement the bitcoin reserve strategy, the Treasury Secretary is directed to \""establish a decentralized network of secure bitcoin storage facilities distributed across the U.S.” These facilities are said to be selected based on comprehensive risk assessments that prioritize geographic diversity, security, and accessibility. This structured approach could allow the government to add to its holdings without also disrupting markets. Reallocation of Federal Reserve surplus and gold certificates To fund the bitcoin strategic reserve, the government is turning to some innovative sources that do not require any additional taxation, including: Reduction of Federal Reserve banks' discretionary surplus funds from $6.83 billion to $2.40 billion Allocation of $6 billion from Federal Reserve annual net earnings for fiscal years 2025-2029 Revaluation of Federal Reserve gold certificates to reflect current market values By far, reevaluation of the gold certificates represents reserve’s the most substantial proposed funding source. Currently, the certificates are valued at their 1974 price of $42.22 per ounce; spot gold trades above $3,000 per ounce today however. Simply updating these certificates to reflect their current fair market value, the reserve could generate nearly $700 billion and not increase the national debt. Senator Lummis has emphasized that this approach is entirely “budget neutral” because it would not use any additional taxpayer funds to acquire bitcoin. Similarly, presidential advisor Bo Hines described the strategy as realizing unrealized gains on existing holdings, effectively just repurposing assets already on government balance sheets. Results and Discussion: Macroeconomic Implications Establishment of the bitcoin strategic reserve creates far-reaching consequences beyond mere asset accumulation, with effects rippling through domestic and international economic landscapes. Monetary policy dynamics and geopolitical relationships are being reshaped. Impact on U.S. dollar stability and inflation control Dollar stability could significantly be affected by the U.S. introduction of bitcoin as a reserve asset. Some proponents argue that a strategic bitcoin reserve would strengthen the dollar's position, but there are also critics suggesting that such bitcoin adoption might signal weakening confidence in traditional monetary systems in general. Indeed, such a reserve could lead to a broad depreciation and underperformance of U.S. financial assets on the global market. Moreover, the impact of bitcoin on inflation remains contested. Bitcoin's deflationary nature theoretically offers protection against excessive inflation, a weakening dollar could create inflationary pressure by raising imported goods costs. However, benchmark estimates suggest these effects may be relatively small. Geopolitical leverage and global digital leadership By establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, the U.S. aims to position itself as the \""crypto capital of the world,” securing geopolitical advantages amid growing competition from China. This move represents a calibrated action that embraces cryptocurrency's future influence without undermining confidence in the dollar. Certainly, such leadership could enhance America's standing in global financial diplomacy, providing additional leverage over foreign adversaries. Furthermore, the initiative sends a clear message that the United States intends to lead in crypto innovation while maintaining the dollar's central role. Potential risks of de-dollarization and market manipulation Dangers of publicizing bitcoin must account for the fact that new payment systems, facilitating cross-border transactions and already without U.S. bank involvement, have been rapidly evolving, potentially undermining dollar hegemony. Despite having clear benefits, the bitcoin strategic reserve also faces substantial risks, among the most substantial, sparking global de-dollarization trends. This will no doubt accelerate the pace at which nations increasingly diversify away from the U.S.-engineered dollar-centric system. There are also legitimate concerns about market manipulation because government purchases or sales of bitcoin may have great psychological impact on bitcoin's already volatile price swings. Senator Warren has brought some questions about possible market manipulation, following price surges right after the reserve announcements. Finally, if the U.S. and a few other major powers accumulate significant amounts of bitcoin, they will effectively control the market, in contradiction of bitcoin's foundational principle: decentralization. Limitations and Criticisms of the Bitcoin Reserve Plan The bitcoin strategic reserve’s ambitious vision will never overcome its criticisms for some, unless “time tells” them otherwise. Dissenting economists and financial experts fuel policymakers, who, new to bitcoin, question both the reserve’s economic viability and its overall governance structure. Volatility and lack of intrinsic value concerns Critics highlight that bitcoin's known price volatility is a—perhaps the—most fundamental obstacle to accepting it as a reserve asset. Historically, bitcoin has experienced violent drops in price, sometimes seeing 50%+ drawbacks in short periods. Despite always recovering and rebounding even higher to date, many still call into question its reliability for a federal reserves fund. This volatility prompted the UK Treasury to reject a bitcoin reserve themselves. \""Bitcoin and other crypto assets have been historically volatile, relative to stable fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and commodities, such as gold,\"" they stated. Beyond volatility, critics also challenge—or perhaps, misunderstand—bitcoin's fundamental value proposition, citing: Lack of intrinsic utility: Unlike the American Strategic Petroleum Reserve, bitcoin lacks any known “utility”---a use or purpose—likely to be found helpful in critical infrastructure, defense, or disaster response scenarios Speculative nature: Some financial experts characterize bitcoin as a “high-beta” speculative asset, and not a true inflation hedge by any means No backing: Unlike dollars or gold certificates, bitcoin is not backed by physical assets or government guarantees, which inspire confidence in stores of value The Swiss National Bank, National Bank of Poland, and Singapore's central bank have all rejected the asset class for their own reserves. Singapore additionally stated that cryptocurrencies \""do not align with long-term investment strategies due to their speculative nature.” ==== Political conflicts of interest and transparency issues Senator Warren has raised continuous concerns about potential conflicts of interest in the strategic reserve's implementation, particularly regarding Trump and his administration officials with cryptocurrency investments and, in trump’s case, memecoins. The strategic reserve’s announcement triggered not-unexpected market volatility—initially causing surges in trading value then sharp drops—leaving some asking questions about the obvious potential for market manipulation inherent. Bloomberg news once characterized the bitcoin reserve as an \""abysmally bad idea\"" creating a \""ready-made vehicle for corruption.\"" Critics argue the reserve effectively functions as a wealth transfer mechanism, which will merely enrich current large bitcoin holders (aka “whales”) and at taxpayer expense. Transparency remains problematic; critics point to the Trump administration's close ties to the cryptocurrency industry. His businesses create undeniable conflicts when establishing regulations for the industry; his administration officials have their own clearly stated financial interests. The inclusion of cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin—a commodity, not a security— in the reserve has been described as wide open to influence by even more special interest influence groups. Conclusion A United States of America strategic bitcoin reserve represents a watershed moment in U.S. and world monetary policy, marking a bold sovereign step into federal management of digital assets. Through careful acquisition of up to 200,000 new bitcoin per year for five years, the U.S. initiative aims to strengthen its own national economic security and address its long-term national debt challenges as well. Despite stated objections, several other economic projections suggest significant potential benefits of the U.S. bitcoin reserve, especially to reduce national debt. VanEck research firm estimates a possible debt reduction of 35% by the year 2049, while new financial mechanisms, like BitBonds, could save another $70 billion annually. Bitcoin's deflationary nature is yet another compelling argument for the bitcoin national strategic reserve. Yet substantial challenges remain. Bitcoin's still-eyebrow-raising price volatility, transparency concerns, plus the political conflicts of interest outlined above demand scrutiny. Critics rightfully question whether cryptocurrency holdings align with traditional reserve asset requirements, particularly given their speculative nature and lack of intrinsic value, Ultimately success depends on the balanced addressing of these valid concerns, while not ignoring a focus on potential—some say probable, others inevitable—long-term economic benefits for the United States of going through with their strategic reserve plan, and fully funding their 1 million bitcoin target—a move which will reshape financial dynamics worldwide and for decades to come.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.com As illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sight Strong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).” However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement. Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises. Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume. On May 21, retail investor demand for Bitcoin, defined as wallets buying/selling between $0 and $10,000, remained low at just 3.2% over 30 days, despite BTC trading within $2,000 of its all-time high.

2025-05-21T15:40:00.000Z,"Why Bitcoin's Relationship With Equities Has Changed","Summary The correlation between bitcoin and equities has evolved from non-correlated to a positive correlation since 2020. The heightened positive correlation during market volatility implies that bitcoin is exhibiting equity-like behavior. Higher positive correlations are frequently observed during periods of market stress. By Dr. Mark Shore At a Glance The correlation between bitcoin and equities has evolved from non-correlated to a positive correlation since 2020 The heightened positive correlation during market volatility implies that bitcoin is exhibiting equity-like behavior In its early years, bitcoin was considered a diversifier in a portfolio, often compared to digital gold and even thought of as an inflation hedge. Even so, bitcoin did not have any meaningful ties with equities. In 2020, a significant shift occurred. The relationship between bitcoin and equities turned positive and has remained so over the past five years. What has changed? Daily returns data from January 2014 to April 2025 reveal a correlation of 0.2 between bitcoin and major equity indices. However, when examined in smaller time frames, the relationship becomes more pronounced. In 2020, the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indices shifted from being non-correlated to a positive relationship, with rolling correlations jumping to about 0.5. The positive correlation is not limited to a single index. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 show very similar patterns, indicating that the trend is widespread across the equities market. This suggests that bitcoin's performance is now more closely tied to the broader economic and market conditions. Higher positive correlations are frequently observed during periods of market stress. For example, from February to March 2020 – during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic – and again in 2022, from July to October 2023 and from January to early April 2025. These periods of market uncertainty have seen bitcoin and equities move in the same direction, reflecting a risk-off sentiment that is common to both asset classes. Box and Whisker plots from 2017 to 2019 show medians near zero, indicating a lack of correlation between bitcoin and equities. However, from 2020 to 2022, the medians range just above 0.4, highlighting the significant shift in the relationship. There are five seemingly common factors between equities and bitcoin that may be contributing to this positive correlation. Institutional Acceptance: The growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by institutions and the financial community has been a key driver. This has led to a continuous momentum of future allocations to digital assets, making bitcoin a more mainstream investment. Portfolio Integration: As more users integrate crypto into their portfolios, they often do so alongside traditional investments. This dual investment strategy can lead to similar market movements, especially during times of economic uncertainty. High Volatility: Bitcoin's daily standard deviation is roughly three to five times higher than that of equities. This high volatility suggests that bitcoin may now serve as a beta extension of a portfolio's equity exposure, amplifying market movements. Supply and Holding Patterns: The reduction in bitcoin supply held at exchanges, as more and the concurrent rise in supply held by other entities, such as institutional investors and long-term holders, indicates a maturing market. This shift in supply dynamics can influence price movements and correlations.

2025-05-21T15:22:36.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Sets Record Daily Close As Buyers Eye $110,000","Bitcoin (BTC) shrugged off its sluggish start to the week as it rebounded from Monday’s low of $102,135 to briefly cross $107,313 on Tuesday. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $108,010 during the ongoing session before dropping to its current level of $106,488. BTC’s price jump has seen it break out of its consolidation phase, during which it traded between $100,000 and $105,000. Strive Looking To Acquire 75,000 Bitcoin From Mt. Gox Claims Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strive plans to build its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing distressed Bitcoin claims at a significant discount. The firm plans to purchase 75,000 Bitcoin from claims tied to the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. In a May 20 regulatory filing, Strive stated that it has partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target claims to Bitcoin that have received definitive legal rulings but are awaiting distribution. According to company representatives, buying the claims would allow it to purchase Bitcoin at a discount and grow its Bitcoin per share ratio ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities. The firm has not disclosed any Bitcoin holdings but claims it faces fewer restrictions on purchasing Bitcoin than companies going public through Special Purpose Acquisition Company mergers. Strive also stated it requires shareholder approval to pursue Mt. Gox claims and plans to lodge a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to outline the complete terms of the proposed transaction. Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” Bill Could Be Bullish For Bitcoin President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful” bill is set to become law, extending the 2017 tax cuts, while introducing new tax measures, including a $1,000 tax credit for all children born in the country and an exemption for tips. The bill also raises the estate tax exemption to $15 million. The bill could be bullish for Bitcoin and other altcoins for several reasons. First, it is expected to increase the US public debt and deficit. According to estimates by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the bill could raise the public debt by $3.3 trillion over the next ten years and push the debt-to-GDP ratio from 100% to 125%. Rising risks of a government default are viewed as bullish for Bitcoin , which has enhanced its reputation as a safe-haven asset. Standard Chartered Predicts $500,000 Milestone For Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $108,000 as Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick reaffirmed the bank’s prediction that the flagship cryptocurrency could reach $500,000 by 2029, citing government and institutional exposure. Kendrick highlighted the spike in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Q1 13F data, which indicated a rise in government and institutional exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency. “The quarterly 13F data is the best test of our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures, helping the price reach our USD 500,000 target level.” Kendrick pointed out that ETF exposure among these institutions declined in Q1 as companies began gaining exposure to Bitcoin through Strategy shares. “We believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings.” The growing interest in Bitcoin can be attributed to declining confidence in government bonds thanks to macroeconomic factors. A research note by KKR & Co stated, “During risk-off days, government bonds are no longer fulfilling their role as the 'shock-absorbers' in a traditional portfolio.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) shrugged off a slow start to the week to register a strong recovery on Tuesday, briefly crossing $107,313 before settling at $106,855. The flagship cryptocurrency also crossed $108,000 during the ongoing session before declining to current levels. BTC’s jump above $105,000 has been fueled by several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Investors have lost confidence in traditional financial systems, while cooling trade war tensions and tariff concerns have fueled a risk-on sentiment, pushing investors towards risk assets. Persistent inflation has eroded purchasing power, while the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance has kept real yields on the higher side. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also registered steady inflows, indicating a resurgence in institutional interest. BTC started the previous week in the red after encountering selling pressure and volatility. Sellers ultimately pushed the price down over 1% to $102,728. The flagship cryptocurrency recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123. BTC was back in the red on Wednesday, registering a drop of 0.53% to $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday, registering a marginal decline to $103,545. Source: TradingView BTC continued to decline on Saturday, registering another marginal decline and settling at $103,235. The price recovered on Sunday as markets rebounded, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,479. BTC started the week on a bearish note, plunging to a low of $102,145 before rebounding to settle at $105,573, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Despite a bearish start to the week, BTC rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.21% and settling at $106,855. BTC has crossed $107,000 during the ongoing session. If buyers maintain momentum, the price could cross $110,000 and set a new all-time high. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-05-21T15:20:25.000Z,"Can Monero’s XMR price surge 40% and revisit all-time high?","Monero price continues to chart its own path this month as demand for the biggest privacy coin rises. Monero ( XMR ) has rallied for seven consecutive weeks as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other altcoins stalled. It jumped to a high of $367.67 this week, its highest level since May 17, up by 265% from its lowest level in 2024. Monero gained momentum following the Tornado Cash ( TORN ) court ruling and the eventual lifting of U.S. government sanctions , which drove investors back to privacy coins. One hope is that centralized exchanges that previously delisted it, like Binance and Coinbase, will relist it this year. Additionally, the Donald Trump administration is composed of pro-crypto officials, including Paul Atkins, the head of the SEC.

It dropped from a record high of 5.64 GH/s last week to 4.51 GH/s. Hash rate refers to the computational power used by a network to process and validate transactions. A falling hash rate indicates reduced mining activity in the network. XMR price technical analysis XMR price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that the XMR price has been in a strong bullish trend over the past few weeks. This rebound followed a prolonged period in which the coin remained between the support and resistance levels at $134.42 and $186.18 for over two years. This consolidation was likely part of the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. It has now moved into the markup phase, which is characterized by higher demand than supply. Monero has moved above all moving averages. Additionally, the Average Directional Index has risen to 25, a sign that the trend is strengthening. The Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator have both reached overbought territory. Therefore, the coin will likely keep soaring as bulls target the all-time high of $515, which is about 40% above the current level. An alternative scenario is that it drops to retest the support at $200 before resuming the uptrend.

The facility, developed alongside a major independent power producer, will operate directly on a solar energy site and is expected to go live in Q3 2025, according to a company release. The project is designed to convert underutilized renewable energy into Bitcoin ( BTC ) via a vertically integrated model. According to Sangha, investors contribute capital—either in fiat or Bitcoin—to help build the site and, in return, receive streaming payouts in Bitcoin well below market price. This approach, the company says, avoids the inefficiencies of traditional mining intermediaries. “This isn’t just about mining—it’s about how capital flows in and out of Bitcoin,” said Sangha CEO Spencer Marr. “We’re offering direct access to productive infrastructure without the noise of speculative equities or hosting overhead.” You might also like: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq slide amid U.S.-China chip feud The company’s plan to scale across the U.S. The project marks a proof-of-concept for Sangha’s broader strategy: scale across the U.S. by deploying similar mining operations on renewable energy sites suffering from congestion or negative pricing. In this case, the solar site’s owner leases 5.5 acres to Sangha and supplies behind-the-meter power, creating new income for the IPP without shouldering any capital or operational burden. The company says its financial models forecast energy and Bitcoin pricing in real time to guide curtailment and maximize profits. Its smart-contract-ready platform also offers transparent fees and optional blockchain-linked payouts. Sangha’s structure borrows heavily from real estate and renewable energy project finance, emphasizing risk mitigation and repeatable deployment. Regulatory complexity is handled in-house, helping streamline partnerships with energy providers. The $14 million raise is part of a $17 million target. Once live, the Texas site is expected to offer some of the lowest power costs for mining in North America, the company said.

The asset has left well over $110 million in shorts liquidated with its latest rally, according to data from CoinGlass. It felt impossible a month and a half ago to talk about a new record. BTC’s price had tumbled to under $75,000 during the darkest hours of the Trump-induced trade war and little hope was to be seen. However, the asset used the next 30 to 45 days to reverse its trend completely and broke above $100,000 on May 8 – it hasn’t looked back ever since. The past few days saw a lot of volatility, and BTC came inches away from tapping a new all-time high on a couple of occasions, only to be stopped at $108,000 earlier today.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView. This climb to a record high came nine days after the White House announced a 90-day trade agreement between the US and China on May 12, temporarily slashing import tariffs to 10%. BTC/USD, 1-month chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The 90-day tariff suspension and the cooperative tone in negotiations removed the risk of “sudden re-escalation,” which had a significant impact on risk appetite among traditional and cryptocurrency investors, Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen, told Cointelegraph. US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs were seen as the biggest macroeconomic threat to traditional equities and cryptocurrency markets in 2025. Bitcoin briefly fell to a year-to-date low of $74,434 on April 7, five days after Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, sending shockwaves across global markets, with the S&P 500 losing more than $5 trillion in value, its largest drop to date. Bitcoin started its recovery on April 9 after Trump’s Liberation Day marked the “climax of uncertainty” for market participants, Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph at the time. Related: Bitcoin more of a ‘diversifier’ than safe-haven asset: Report Bitcoin entered May with “near-flawless setup” Bitcoin kicked off May with a “near-flawless setup, catalyzed by a rare alignment of geopolitical de-escalation, improving regulatory optics and macroeconomic tailwinds,” according to Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex exchange. “The Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks have defused one of the primary geopolitical volatility engines of the past two years,” Kooner told Cointelegraph, adding: “Rather than triggering capital flight from Bitcoin — as often seen when risk wanes — this easing is unlocking a risk-on rotation. We’re seeing capital rotate into BTC and high-beta tech as the need for geopolitical hedging fades, but liquidity remains abundant.” The capital rotation reflects a “maturing narrative” as “Bitcoin is no longer just a fear hedge — it’s increasingly a high-conviction risk asset in periods of macro stability,” Kooner said.

Vhodný je na narodeniny, meniny, Vianoce, promócie alebo ako odmena za študijné či pracovné úspechy. Tvorcovia obsahu Unboxing videá, recenzie a reakčné príspevky na sociálnych sieťach patria medzi obľúbené formáty online obsahu. Harry Potter mystery box je vizuálne atraktívny, tematicky silný a vyvoláva emócie, čo sú tri základné ingrediencie úspešného virálneho obsahu. Ak pôsobíte na YouTube, TikToku alebo Instagrame, takýto balíček vám môže pomôcť zaujať vaše publikum a zvýšiť dosah. Na čo si dať pozor pri kúpe mystery boxov Mystery boxy sú bezpochyby zábavným a inovatívnym spôsobom nakupovania. No ich popularita so sebou prináša aj nepoctivých predajcov, ktorí sa snažia využiť dôverčivosť fanúšikov. Pri nákupe mystery boxu, a obzvlášť takého, ktorý je tematicky naviazaný na globálnu značku ako Harry Potter, je mimoriadne dôležité dbať na transparentnosť predajcu a kvalitu služieb. Tu je niekoľko kľúčových odporúčaní, ktoré vám pomôžu navigovať sa v digitálnom svete mystery boxov: Nakupujte len na overených stránkach: Vyhýbajte sa neznámym e-shopom, ktoré nemajú žiadne recenzie, nepôsobia profesionálne alebo majú podozrivo nízke ceny. Častým varovným signálom je aj zlá gramatika alebo nekonkrétne popisy produktov. Vždy si pred nákupom overte ako dlho daná stránka pôsobí a či má reálnych zákazníkov. Skontrolujte licenciu a pôvod produktov: Harry Potter ako značka je licencovaná a chránená, čo znamená, že oficiálne produkty môžu vyrábať len overení partneri (napr. Warner Bros. Licensing). V prípade mystery boxov je dôležité, aby predajca jasne uvádzal, že produkty sú originálne a oficiálne licencované. Overte si podmienky reklamácie a vrátenia tovaru : Seriózny predajca ponúka jasne definované pravidlá pre reklamáciu a vrátenie tovaru. Ide o dôležitý právny rámec, ktorý chráni zákazníka v prípade, že dostane poškodený, neúplný alebo neautentický produkt. Ak na stránke tieto informácie chýbajú alebo sú formulované nejednoznačne, ide o ďalší varovný signál. Pozor na skryté poplatky : Niektoré stránky lákajú zákazníkov na nízku cenu boxu, ale pri procese platby sa objavia skryté poplatky, ako napríklad drahé poštovné, manipulačné poplatky, DPH alebo colné poplatky. Takéto „pasce“ sú bežné najmä pri nákupoch z krajín mimo EÚ. Záver Vďaka rastúcej obľube tematických mystery boxov si dnes aj slovenskí zákazníci môžu dopriať kúsok čarodejníckeho sveta vo forme originálnych a často exkluzívnych predmetov. Platformy ako JemLit nastavujú latku vysoko. Navyše, gamifikovaný systém vernostných odmien a dostupná cenová politika robia z nákupu skutočne atraktívnu voľbu nielen pre skalných fanúšikov, ale aj pre zberateľov. Či už hľadáte originálny darček, chcete prekvapiť seba alebo niekoho blízkeho, alebo si len rozšíriť zbierku o niečo výnimočné, Harry Potter mystery box je spôsob, ako do každodenného života vniesť trochu kúziel a fantázie.

Čo je to mystery box a ako funguje? Mystery box je tematický balíček, ktorého presný obsah nie je vopred známy. Pri jeho zakúpení si vyberiete tému (napríklad Harry Potter), ale konkrétne produkty zistíte až po otvorení. Práve tento prvok prekvapenia je dôvodom, prečo sú mystery boxy tak populárne. 2. Sú produkty v Harry Potter mystery boxe originálne a licencované? Áno, v prípade spoľahlivých predajcov, ako je JemLit , ide výhradne o originálne a oficiálne licencované produkty od partnerov značky Harry Potter. Vždy si však pred nákupom overte dôveryhodnosť e-shopu a informácie o produkte. 3. Je možné mystery box vrátiť, ak sa mi jeho obsah nepáči? Podľa európskej legislatívy máte pri online nákupe právo na odstúpenie od zmluvy do 14 dní bez udania dôvodu. To platí aj pre mystery boxy, pokiaľ nebol obsah personalizovaný alebo špeciálne prispôsobený. Odporúča sa vždy skontrolovať podmienky konkrétneho predajcu.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/harry-potter-mystery-box-slovensko/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Gambling|Jemlit|Mystery box",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T15:09:47.000Z,"Bitcoin Nears $110K as Price Hits ATH – $120K Possible This Month?","Key Takeaways: Bitcoin has broken its all-time high and rallied over 40% in six weeks. Cooling trade tensions and new U.S. trade deals have boosted investor risk appetite. Rising ETF inflows suggest more upside ahead. Bitcoin has punched through $109,114.88 on Wednesday, sealing a fresh all-time high after a 40% six-week surge as cooling U.S. trade wars lured risk capital back into crypto. Rising ETF inflows and a $1.2 billion short stack hint at more fireworks ahead. The milestone follows Washington’s surprise tariff truce with Beijing and a limited U.K. pact, brightening the macro picture. With Bitcoin ETFs soaking up supply and shorts clustered near $108k, analysts say a squeeze toward $120k is now in play. Crypto Markets Surge After Trump’s Trade Deals The bullish momentum intensified after President Trump dialed back his aggressive trade rhetoric in recent days, signaling openness to new trade deals and cooling tensions with key partners. That policy shift has reignited investor appetite for risk, with Bitcoin and major altcoins benefiting directly. Earlier in May, the US and China announced an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs on each other’s goods, signaling a cooling of trade tensions. The agreement, delivered via a joint statement in Geneva, provides a 90-day window for both countries to negotiate further economic cooperation. According to the deal, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on American goods from 125% to 10%. BREAKING: The US and China have reached a trade agreement on a 90 day pause. The U.S. will cut tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% (from 145%) for 90 days, while China will lower its levies to 10% (from 125%) for 90 days, according to US Treasury Secretary Bessent. pic.twitter.com/5c7frxxNoW — Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) May 12, 2025 More recently, the US and the UK also announced a limited trade agreement, referred to as the “Economic Prosperity Deal.” The agreement aimed to reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers, enhancing market access and fostering economic collaboration between the two nations. BlackRock’s Dominance in Bitcoin ETF Inflows In Asia, high-net-worth investors are also reallocating capital, pivoting away from U.S. dollar-linked instruments toward gold, Chinese equities, and cryptocurrencies, reinforcing regional interest in Bitcoin. A key factor behind this ATH is the aggressive net spot demand observed in both institutional and retail markets, driven not by leverage but by spot buying. Leading the charge is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has been dominating U.S. ETF inflows since mid-April. In a recent note, Galaxy Digital analysts reaffirmed Bitcoin’s growing perception as a digital store of value, echoing comments from Jay Jacobs, Head of Thematics at BlackRock, who stated that countries are diversifying away from the U.S. dollar in favor of gold and now, Bitcoin. Market Structure Supports Bullish Case Market structure also supports the bullish case. Bitcoin has held above $100,000 for nearly two weeks, with recent closes near $106,500 marking historic strength. Only four prior sessions have ended above the current level, making this breakout significant from a technical perspective. Moreover, data from CoinGlass shows that around $1.2 billion in short positions are concentrated between $107,000 and $108,000. A continued climb could trigger forced liquidations, sending prices sharply higher toward $115,000–$120,000. With ETF inflows rising — and Ethereum spot ETFs gaining traction — the environment favors further upside. Data from Farside shows that Bitcoin ETFs have recorded consistent net inflows over the past five trading sessions, signaling renewed institutional confidence. From May 14 to May 20, every day except saw net positive flows. In particular, May 19 stood out with a significant $667.4 million net inflow, followed by $329.2 million on May 20. These figures suggest investors are increasingly positioning ahead of potential price breakouts, likely in response to improving macroeconomic sentiment and regulatory clarity. Analysts warn of potential profit-taking, but so far, the profit-to-loss ratio on-chain remains below overheating levels (currently 99 vs. 200 threshold). Every strong price acceleration that rapidly shifts large volumes of coins from loss into profit pushes the 30-day SMA of the UTXO profit-to-loss ratio above 200. The higher the spike, the closer the market moves toward an overheating and/or distribution phase. Today, the metric… pic.twitter.com/t9MoHFaMHr — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 21, 2025 Bitcoin’s breakout to a new ATH has strong legs. If bulls maintain control and macro conditions hold steady — especially with the Fed under pressure from weak long-bond demand — the path toward $120,000 this month is realistic.

According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Index , the largest and oldest cryptocurrency hit $109,486 on Wednesday during the early U.S. session. BTC surged more than 46% from its April trough induced by mounting freas over global trade war and U.S. tariffs. The new all-time high came as spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF) gobbled up $3.6 billion in net inflows in May, a sign of rejuvenated investor interest. A slew of bitcoin-focused treasury companies, including Michael Saylor's Strategy and newly-launched firm Twenty One Capital added to the buying spree, helping lift BTC to a new record. Positive regulatory shifts in the U.S. have further supported the market, lending legitimacy of digital assets as an asset class for investors. The U.S. Senate this week advanced a bill to regulate stablecoins while several states and sovereign nations are moving forward with legislation to create bitcoin reserves. Analysts suggested that the current rally is more sustainable than previous ones, citing favorable financial conditions, stablecoin flows and lack of speculative fervor observed in earlier peaks, showing signs of a stronger foundation.

The senator reportedly canceled a scheduled meeting with Garlinghouse without providing a new date—an act many in the XRP community perceived as a snub, triggering a new wave of tribalism in the already fragmented crypto space. Ripple has been marketing that banks are going to use XRP since 2013. I just called my bank, and they've never heard of Ripple. — Phil Geiger (@phil_geiger) May 20, 2025 XRP vs. Bitcoin Maximalism: A Reignited Feud The timing of Geiger’s jab is no coincidence. The crypto community has been embroiled in a fiery discourse ever since Timestabloid reported that Senator Lummis, a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, abruptly pulled out of a scheduled discussion with Ripple’s CEO. No explanation or rescheduling was provided, a move XRP supporters viewed as politically motivated and dismissive of Ripple’s contributions to crypto innovation and policy discourse. The incident fueled the long-standing feud between Bitcoin maximalists, who argue for Bitcoin’s supremacy and the irrelevance of altcoins, and XRP enthusiasts, who see Ripple’s technology as essential to the future of global finance. Phil Geiger’s sarcastic post echoes a popular maximalist narrative: that Ripple’s decade-long marketing claims about XRP being adopted by banks have not materialized meaningfully. The tone of his post suggests that despite Ripple’s years of promotion and partnership announcements, its impact remains largely theoretical to the average consumer, and, according to Geiger, to mainstream banks as well. Ripple’s Track Record with Financial Institutions Since 2013, Ripple has maintained that its blockchain-based payment solutions, including its native token XRP, would revolutionize cross-border banking by offering faster and cheaper alternatives to SWIFT. Over the years, the company has secured partnerships with several financial institutions and central banks for pilot projects and integrations. Yet, many of these initiatives rely on RippleNet or On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) rather than the XRP token itself. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Critics argue that the distinction between Ripple’s software products and XRP is often blurred in marketing campaigns, leading to confusion about XRP’s actual utility. Geiger’s statement, while dismissive, taps into this skepticism by implying that if banks aren’t even aware of Ripple, then XRP’s touted future as a banking staple may be overblown. A Clash of Ideologies The XRP vs. Bitcoin feud is more than a battle over market share; it reflects a philosophical divide. Bitcoin maximalists like Geiger prioritize decentralization, censorship resistance, and trustless systems—traits they argue XRP lacks due to Ripple’s centralized control. Meanwhile, XRP advocates counter that practical adoption and institutional integration matter more than ideological purity , especially in the context of remittances and international finance. The canceled meeting between Senator Lummis and Ripple’s CEO added fuel to this ideological fire. Lummis’s close alignment with Bitcoin interests has led many to question whether there is an institutional bias against other projects in the regulatory arena. In this context, Geiger’s post can be seen not merely as personal skepticism but as a calculated attempt to diminish XRP’s standing at a politically sensitive moment. Phil Geiger’s post is emblematic of the renewed antagonism between Bitcoin maximalists and XRP supporters —a tension inflamed by political snubs, regulatory battles, and divergent visions for crypto’s future. Whether XRP ultimately achieves the banking adoption that Ripple has long promised remains uncertain. But what is clear is that, in the ongoing war of crypto ideologies, even a phone call to a local bank can be wielded as a weapon.

Middle East Emerges as a Global Crypto Hub The Middle East, particularly the United Arab Emirates, is rapidly positioning itself as a cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation ecosystem. The region’s progressive regulatory frameworks and business-friendly environments are attracting major crypto firms seeking to expand their operations. The UAE has emerged as a central hub for blockchain and digital asset activity, offering a robust, multilayered regulatory environment. The FSRA governs ADGM in Abu Dhabi, while the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority ( VARA ) regulates Dubai’s digital asset sector. The Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) oversees broader crypto activities at the national level. The UAE is poised to become a key destination for crypto and stablecoin ventures seeking refuge from the MiCA regulation. #UAE #MiCA https://t.co/85ivLb0rKs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 6, 2025 The UAE’s ambition to become a leading global crypto hub is reflected in its dedicated free zones, such as the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Ras Al Khaimah Digital Assets Oasis, which offer regulatory autonomy and business incubation for digital asset firms. This structured approach has turned the UAE into a magnet for international crypto firms. In the past year alone, the region has experienced record growth in digital asset engagement. The Middle East saw nearly $390 billion in on-chain crypto volume between mid-2022 and mid-2023, accounting for over 7% of global activity—a figure expected to rise as more exchanges become licensed and operational in 2025. The UAE alone experienced a 241% increase in cryptocurrency app downloads from 2023 to 2024, with over 15 million installs by year-end and record growth in December.

2025-05-21T14:36:14.000Z,"Metaplanet Faces Major Short Squeeze as Bitcoin Bet Defies Bears","A brewing financial drama is capturing global attention as Metaplanet Inc., Asia’s leading Bitcoin treasury company, has become Japan’s most shorted stock. Data shared on X by company CEO Simon Gerovich shows more than 25% of Metaplanet’s shares have been borrowed for short positions, setting the stage for what some crypto community members feel could be a potential GameStop-style short squeeze, but this time powered by Bitcoin. BTC Strategy Powers Record Growth Metaplanet’s speedy rise from a hospitality company into Japan’s biggest corporate BTC holder has made it both a darling of the Bitcoin maximalist crowd and a target of institutional skepticism. On May 18, the firm reported a record ¥877 million ($6M) in Q1 revenue, with a whopping 88% attributed to its Bitcoin strategy. It has also increased its holdings of the crypto asset by almost four times since January, with its latest buy of 1,004 BTC for over $104 million bringing its entire stash to 7,800 BTC valued at more than $800 million. That same day, Michael Saylor’s Strategy also announced a 7,390 BTC purchase , pushing its holdings to 576,230 BTC. Still, instead of boosting investor confidence across the board, the Tokyo-listed company’s crypto pivot prompted an intense wave of short interest. Japanese bond yields, like the 30-year JGB spiking to 3.14% on May 20, seem to have sparked bearish bets on risk-on assets, including crypto-heavy stocks like Metaplanet’s. Over the past seven days, the firm’s shares dipped 12.84%, suggesting early success for short sellers. However, they seem to have underestimated retail and institutional momentum, and the trend may be quickly reversing. Short Squeeze Risk Escalates In two consecutive days, Metaplanet’s share price rocketed to its daily limit-up and was halted on both days, closing at ¥933 on May 21. The halts, triggered by Tokyo Stock Exchange circuit breakers, have prevented short sellers from exiting their positions, potentially setting up a slow-motion squeeze. Bitcoiners are now rallying behind Metaplanet, likening it to the 2021 GameStop frenzy, but with one crucial difference: Metaplanet is backed by Bitcoin, not meme stock hype. “Metaplanet MTPLF will be the GME of 2021,” tweeted analyst Chicken Genius. “Except this time, backed by the hardest monetary hedge in the world. Bitcoin.” On May 20, CEO Gerovich shared that his firm’s OTC listing had seen an uptick in ranking, jumping to third by dollar volume and fourth by trade counts across more than 12,000 companies. What makes the current play even more potent is Metaplanet’s strategy. As a community member, Macrocomics noted , the business leverages a put-selling strategy on Bitcoin futures to either acquire BTC at a discount or generate income for more purchases, thereby improving its Bitcoin yield without taking on debt. So, while short sellers may view the organization as overextended, its fundamentals and market sentiment tell a different story. “Imagine being short Metaplanet on the TSE and being unable to close your short positions the past 2 days because of limit up halts,” warned an X user. With the firm’s stock locked in limit-up territory, traders are bracing for another spike when trading resumes. And if retail investors join the rally, as they did with GameStop, the squeeze could intensify, forcing short sellers to cover at even higher prices.

While Bitcoin teases a breakout to fresh ATH, hovering at $106,590, privacy-focused coins Monero and Zcash display lucrative performance, up 68% and 30%, respectively, on their monthly price charts. The rally has grabbed the attention of institutional and retail investors, especially as XMR and ZEC outperformed top assets like Bitcoin and the US dollar. Meanwhile, Bitfinex identified the catalyst driving privacy digital tokens: the renewed interest in anonymity within the crypto sector. Bitfinex @bitfinex · Follow Privacy has returned to the spotlight in crypto.As institutions pursue compliance and visibility, @monero and @zcash attract users who value discretion, autonomy, and control over their transactions.🕵️‍♀️Explore the renewed interest in privacy coins ⬇️ blog.bitfinex.com/education/are-… 7:03 PM · May 16, 2025 196 Reply Copy link Read 55 replies The intensified regulatory scrutiny globally has likely sparked interest in confidential transactions. Privacy prioritized amid regulatory chatter Monero and Zcash’s comeback coincides with rising worries about centralized data gathering, government outreach, and digital surveillance. With nations introducing stiffer AML and KYC policies, crypto enthusiasts are migrating to projects that promise transactional privacy. Bitfinex explained : “As central banks and regulators move toward frameworks such as CBDCs, real-time transaction monitoring, and stricter KYC/AML policies, users seek tools that preserve financial anonymity. Privacy coins offer a technological counterweight to these trends by enabling peer-to-peer value transfer without exposing transaction histories or wallet balances.” Monero and Zcash appear to be the perfect solutions on that front. XMR’s blockchain uses stealth addresses and ring signatures to ensure anonymous transactions. Meanwhile, Zcash’s zero-knowledge proofs allow individuals to choose between shielded and transparent transfers. Therefore, the duo’s comeback reflects sentiment shifts, with most users prioritizing privacy. XMR and ZEC price actions Top privacy cryptocurrencies displayed substantial gains as their market cap increased by 3% in the past 24 hours to $45.81 billion. Also, their daily trading volume soared 20% to $5.49 billion (CoinMarketCap data), indicating renewed interest in the asset class. XMR trades at $362 after gaining 4.06% and 6% in the past day and week. It has remained elevated in the past few sessions amidst upbeat sentiments in privacy cryptocurrencies. Zcash joined the upside, gaining 3% the previous day to hover at $41.41. The altcoins reflect significant gains on their monthly timeframes, hinting at extended uptrends in the near term.

Speaking on the Bankless YouTube channel , Hayes gave a full rundown of his family office Maelstrom Fund’s strategy and warned of some turbulence ahead – even as he remains confident in a strong bull run. Inside Maelstrom Fund: Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead the Way Hayes said that the Maelstrom Fund is largely anchored by the two biggest cryptocurrencies. “Maelstrom [Fund] is about like 60% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum. And then a lot of other shitcoins, term sheets of token deals and stuff,” he said. As for his non-crypto assets, Hayes is holding physical gold, gold mining stocks, and treasury bills. He sees this mix as a way to balance high-risk opportunities in crypto with more traditional, stable investments. Bitcoin’s Big Run: $250,000 by Year-End? With Bitcoin trading at $106,480 ( may differ ), Hayes is bullish, predicting a surge to $150,000–$200,000 by summer 2025, a potential 90% jump. But brace for impact: he expects a “nasty correction” before Bitcoin rockets to $250,000 by the end of 2025. His confidence stems from market cycles and macroeconomic trends, though he didn’t shy away from the volatility ahead. Ethereum’s Uphill Battle and Altcoin Wildcard Ethereum, now at $2,528 ( may vary ), faces a tougher road. Hayes pegs $5,000 as a key milestone by year-end, potentially reigniting hype that could push ETH to $10,000 or even $20,000 at the cycle’s peak. Hayes expects a vibrant season for altcoins driven by fresh narratives and decentralized exchange gems, but warns against overhyped, high-FDV tokens with no traction. Only the innovative will shine. Bitcoin as a Reserve Currency? Hayes Explains Arthur Hayes sees Bitcoin as a global reserve currency if the U.S. dollar’s credibility fades due to ‘ reckless ‘ treasury spending. Its ‘ decentralized ‘, fixed-supply nature positions it as a digital alternative to gold, hedging against fiat collapse. A Market to Watch Hayes’ analytics and Maelstrom’s actions signal a dynamic crypto transformation. Will his predictions hold?

2025-05-21T14:30:53.000Z,"JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo All Downgraded by Moody’s Following US Government Loss of AAA Rating: Report","Moody’s has downgraded deposit ratings of top US lenders JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo just days after stripping the nation of its triple-A rating. In a new report by Bloomberg, the lenders’ long-term deposit ratings were lowered to Aa2, a one-step decrease and Moody’s third-highest level. The reason cited by Moody’s for the downgrade is the government’s weakened ability to support the banks. On Friday, Moody’s downgraded America’s credit rating from AAA to AA1 while changing the country’s outlook from negative to stable. Moody’s attributes the downgrade to the United States’ soaring national debt and interest payment ratios that exceed those of other countries with the same credit rating. “As deficits and debt have grown, and interest rates have risen, interest payments on government debt have increased markedly. Without adjustments to taxation and spending, we expect budget flexibility to remain limited, with mandatory spending, including interest expense, projected to rise to around 78% of total spending by 2035 from about 73% in 2024.” Other bank rating downgrades included the senior unsecured debt ratings for some rated subsidiaries and branches of Bank of America. Moody’s also cut the long-term counterparty risk ratings for some units of Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, lowering them to Aa2 from Aa1.

2025-05-21T15:42:51.000Z,"Bitcoin enters ‘acceleration phase’ resembling BTC price gains seen after Trump election victory","Key takeaways: The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume. On May 21, retail investor demand for Bitcoin, defined as wallets buying/selling between $0 and $10,000, remained low at just 3.2% over 30 days, despite BTC trading within $2,000 of its all-time high.Bitcoin’s retail investor volumes.

This indicates fresh capital inflows into the market at higher prices. As Cointelegraph reported, holding above $2,400 was crucial to ensure a potential $3,000 retest.Ethereum: Key pricing levels.

Ether ETFs registered $100.7 million in net inflows in the last three days, per Farside Investors’ data.Meanwhile, the bears will attempt to keep the $2,600 resistance in place to increase the likelihood of pulling the price lower. The immediate target is below the $2,400 level, or the 200-day SMA.Below $2,400, the next key area of interest remains between $2,200 and the psychological level at $2,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView. This climb to a record high came nine days after the White House announced a 90-day trade agreement between the US and China on May 12, temporarily slashing import tariffs to 10%.BTC/USD, 1-month chart.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‘address poisoning’ attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case.

The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries. The lawyers urged the SEC to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws.”Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-royalties-not-securities-sec-peirce?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T08:27:53.000Z,"South Korea tightens crypto rules ahead of institutional market entry","South Korea is tightening rules around digital asset transactions as it prepares to allow institutional players into its crypto market, introducing new guidelines for nonprofit crypto sales and stricter listing standards for exchanges.On May 20, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea said during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting that it had finalized sweeping new measures.Set to take effect in June, the updated rules allow both nonprofit organizations and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies, but under new compliance standards.Nonprofit entities must have at least five years of audited financial history to be permitted to receive and sell virtual asset donations. They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations. Source: FSCRelated: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFsExchange sales to be restrictedCrypto exchanges will be allowed to liquidate user fees paid in crypto, but only to cover operational costs. Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors.Cointelegraph contacted South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cardsSouth Korean candidates push pro-crypto agendaSouth Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, aiming to curb capital flight and bolster the country’s financial autonomy.Speaking at a recent policy forum, Lee said a won-based stablecoin could help retain domestic wealth and reduce dependence on foreign-backed digital currencies such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC).The initiative is part of Lee’s broader push for digital asset reforms, which also includes legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party, has also expressed support for introducing spot crypto ETFs, signaling bipartisan momentum on the issue.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-tightens-kyc-rules-ahead-of-institutional-crypto-entry?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

He said that the experience and positioning of dedicated crypto VCs “has compounded over time,” creating barriers for less focused investors trying to enter the space.Founded in 2001, Theta shifted its focus to digital assets in 2018 and now manages about $1.2 billion.

However, that’s a modest uptick from the 372 deals seen in Q4 2024.Despite fewer deals, total funding more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $6 billion in Q1 compared to $2.6 billion in Q1 2024, also doubling from the previous quarter’s $3 billion.PitchBook’s senior crypto analyst Robert Le noted that even amid macroeconomic uncertainty, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”The bulk of the investment — around $2.55 billion across just 16 deals — went to companies in asset management, trading platforms and crypto financial services. Infrastructure and development firms followed, raising nearly $955 million across 30 deals.Web3-focused companies saw the third-most deals and funding, at 23 and $231.2 million, respectively.

2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC.

However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation. Robinhood is committed to leading this trend under a compliant framework,” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said.Related: SEC Chair: Blockchain ‘holds promise’ of new kinds of market activityTokenization gains momentumRobinhood’s proposal comes amid a renewed wave of interest in RWA tokenization, with major players from both traditional finance and crypto making headlines last week.On April 30, BlackRock filed to create a blockchain-based share class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund, allowing a digital ledger to mirror investor ownership.

Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.”India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators.

2025-05-20T10:45:00.000Z,"Bitcoin privacy tool Payjoin receives $100K grant from Maelstrom","Bitcoin developer Ben Allen has received a $100,000 grant from investment firm Maelstrom to support the development of Payjoin, a privacy-focused tool aimed at improving Bitcoin’s scalability and privacy.According to a May 20 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Maelstrom will finance Allen’s work on his Payjoin devkit alongside Dan Gould. The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy.Payjoin Developer Kit’s website. Source: Payjoin Dev KitPayjoin was first proposed by Nicolas Dorier in 2019 in Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 78. The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction.“Namely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,“ the Maelstrom announcement states.A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen’s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach:“We believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.“Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure — zkSNACKs CEOPayjoin: Soon in wallets near you?Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets. He explained that the funding will enable him to work on the project full time.The announcement points out that the system presents challenges, with the receiver needing to be online and the payment communication flow being more complex than normal non-interactive Bitcoin transactions. Maelstrom’s chief investment officer and BitMEX crypto exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes said that “improving financial privacy in Bitcoin is extremely important.” He added:“The great thing about Payjoin is that if only a small amount of adoption is achieved, it breaks a key assumption used by financial surveillance companies. The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.“A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm “is keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.” The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects.Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin?Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or notHayes noted that “Payjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don’t use it.” Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily.Allen told Cointelegraph he is “building out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.” He explained that encouraging its adoption “is the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.” The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that “a key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.” “In particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,” they added.Magazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-payjoin-privacy-grant-maelstrom?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
