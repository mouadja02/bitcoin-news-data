The CPN will be a new blockchain-based system designed to facilitate real-time cross-border payments and settlements using its stablecoin, USDC ( USDC ). The CPN is built to support business-to-business payments, cross-border remittances, enterprise treasury operations, and payroll disbursements. With the launch, Circle aims to modernize the $190 trillion global payments industry, which it describes as fragmented and slow, according to the company. Current CPN participants include Alfred Pay, Tazapay, Conduit, and RedotPay — companies that operate across Latin America and Asia. Circle says this initial group is helping open USDC payment corridors in regions with high demand for faster and more transparent financial infrastructure.

According to a new report from local news publication MyLondon , Jacob Irwin-Cline from Portland, Oregon, was on a two-day layover when he requested an Uber after leaving The Roxy, a nightclub in Soho, around 1:30 AM on May 9. The 30-year-old former software developer and crypto investor said he was intercepted by a driver who appeared to match the profile displayed in the app and who called out the alias he had saved as his name in the Uber account. Having reportedly later asked the nightclub for CCTV footage of the incident, Irwin-Cline said it was a “dark sedan” that pulled up, and not the Toyota Prius that was listed on his Uber app. “The guy seemed super chill, super nice,” Irwin-Cline narrated. The techie said he accepted a cigarette from the driver and started feeling disoriented shortly afterwards. He believes the cigarette may have been laced with scopolamine, also known as “Devil’s Breath,” a powerful sedative known for causing blackouts while keeping victims conscious. While in a semi-conscious state, Irwin-Cline inadvertently handed over his phone’s passcode and access to his crypto accounts before he was abandoned in a London suburb as the fake taxi driver fled with his phone. “Less Than 1% Chance” Of Recovering Lost Funds After returning to his hostel with the help of a stranger, he discovered his laptop had been wiped remotely, and he was locked out of his digital accounts. He later regained access but realized that roughly $123,000 in crypto had been withdrawn from his wallet, including around $73,000 in XRP tokens and $50,000 in Bitcoin. He reportedly shared screenshots with MyLondon revealing his XRP holdings dropped from $73,000 to under $1,000 and his BTC from $50,000 to less than $10 on that fateful night. Irwin-Cline said he doesn’t think he was targeted beforehand and that instead the assailant got “lucky” that he had some wealth “stored away.” The FBI’s Virtual Assets Unit is investigating the case, though the crypto investor believes there is “less than one per cent chance” of getting his funds back.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/american-tourist-loses-123000-in-bitcoin-xrp-after-being-robbed-by-fake-uber-driver-in-london/,"BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|London|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T13:44:39.000Z,"Trader Is Certain of 64,000% XRP Price Rally, Sets Likely Timeline","In a bold market projection that has captured the attention of the XRP community, popular crypto influencer The Real Remi Relief has made a stunning claim on X, asserting that XRP could surge by as much as 64,000% in the current bull cycle. According to Remi , this exponential growth could see the price of XRP skyrocket to $1,700 per coin between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. His analysis, deeply rooted in historical market behavior, particularly the 2017–2018 cycle, has sparked renewed interest and debate about the long-term potential of XRP as both a digital asset and a critical component of global financial infrastructure. Told everyone months ago… We’re following the 2017-2108 breakout and to expect a 64,000% increase in XRP to a $1700 XRP Q4/Q1 Told everyone conservatively $1200 EOY Overall I’m expecting 80,000%-150,000% increase in XRP this run (if not more) Now you’re seeing it from a… https://t.co/2klSFT1Efm — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 20, 2025 Historical Patterns and Market Outlook The Real Remi Relief draws a compelling parallel between the current XRP price action and its historic breakout during the 2017–2018 bull run. At that time, XRP defied expectations by rising from mere fractions of a dollar to a peak near $3.84—an astronomical gain that positioned it temporarily as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Remi believes XRP is now following a similar trajectory, only with even more dramatic implications due to broader adoption, legal clarity, and a maturing crypto market. Based on this historical framework, Remi sets a conservative price expectation of $1,200 by the end of 2025. However, he remains confident that XRP could ultimately exceed this target and reach between $1,700 and beyond during the next market expansion phase. This translates to an unprecedented price appreciation of between 80,000% to 150,000%, which he describes as both historic and transformative. Legal Clarity and Ripple’s Strategic Positioning One key driver behind Remi’s optimistic forecast is the increasing legal clarity surrounding XRP and its issuer, Ripple Labs. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres delivered a landmark ruling in the ongoing SEC v. Ripple case, declaring that XRP is not a security when sold on public exchanges. This judgment was widely celebrated as a legal breakthrough for Ripple and a turning point in the broader regulatory landscape for digital assets. Since then, Ripple has aggressively expanded its presence in the global payments ecosystem. With strategic partnerships spanning financial institutions, central banks, and payment corridors across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Ripple is poised to serve as a foundational layer in the future of cross-border settlements. The XRPL’s rapid development—including its native decentralized exchange (DEX), NFT support, and the recent EVM sidechain innovations by Peersyst Technology—further strengthens the case for XRP’s utility and long-term value. Macroeconomic Trends and Institutional Demand Beyond the internal XRP ecosystem, macroeconomic forces and growing institutional interest in blockchain-based solutions contribute to Remi’s bullish thesis. As global economies seek faster, cheaper, and more transparent payment infrastructures, blockchain networks like RippleNet offer a viable alternative to the legacy SWIFT system . Moreover, as central banks continue exploring digital currencies (CBDCs), Ripple’s CBDC platform, built on the XRP Ledger, positions it as a top contender for technological collaboration. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional investors are also warming up to the crypto sector, driven by the proliferation of regulated financial instruments like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. While XRP has not yet received similar investment vehicles, the recent legal developments and increasing enterprise usage could change that. Remi suggests that once institutions recognize XRP’s potential as a neutral, bridge asset for global liquidity, demand could surge dramatically, fueling the kind of price explosion he anticipates. Community Reactions and Market Sentiment Remi’s forecast has sparked both excitement and skepticism across the crypto community. While some users dismiss such projections as overly ambitious, others point to past examples, like Bitcoin’s meteoric rise from under $1,000 to $69,000, as evidence that such parabolic moves are not only possible but integral to crypto’s speculative cycles. What sets The Real Remi Relief apart is its detailed comparison of market cycles and unwavering conviction. His call, while extraordinary, echoes a broader sentiment gaining traction among XRP holders: that the asset is significantly undervalued relative to its use case and future potential. As he stated, “History will be made,” capturing the belief that XRP is on the verge of a historic revaluation. The Real Remi Relief’s 64,000% XRP forecast may seem extreme at first glance, but it is underpinned by a confluence of historical data, technological advancements, and improving regulatory clarity. While such predictions should be approached with cautious optimism, they reflect a growing narrative that XRP could play a central role in the next era of digital finance. With market cycles heating up and institutional capital flowing into the space, XRP’s journey toward $1,200—or even $1,700—may no longer be a distant fantasy, but a bold possibility rooted in the convergence of history, technology, and belief.

However, after some changes were made to the GENIUS law, it is expected to be voted on again in the Senate and the law is expected to pass. At this point, while it is thought that the progress and passage of the GENIUS law will have a positive impact on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said that the groundbreaking stablecoin legislation could pave the way for a crypto bull market that will last for many years. Last week, the 16 Democratic senators who had voted to reject the bill reversed their decision. The GENIUS bill, which is moving forward with the approval process, was voted 66-32 with bipartisan support. The crypto industry hailed the vote as a historic victory that could help “secure the dominance of the US dollar,” while Bitwise CEO said it paved the way for a bull season that will continue for years to come. “Politicians in Washington did the right thing. I don't want to make a prediction without having clear data, but I think by summer we will have our first full-fledged crypto legislation in the US.” These Altcoins Will Benefit the Most! The passage of the GENIUS Act marks another milestone for the crypto market, as spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January 2024. “I believe this law paves the way for a long-term, sustainable rally in crypto assets beyond Bitcoin. The biggest beneficiaries will be Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and various decentralized finance (DeFi) altcoins like Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE).” The Bitwise CIO also added that the status of stablecoins, which have been in the gray zone for many years, will be clarified and will allow major banks to issue stablecoins and merchants to accept them. “I predict that the stablecoin market will quickly become a $2.5 trillion market once the legislation is passed. Just close your eyes here and imagine a world where JPMorgan and Bank of America are issuing stablecoins, where Amazon gives you a 2% discount if you buy with stablecoins instead of Visa, and where accepting stablecoins is as common as accepting Venmo or PayPal. Because that’s the world we’re going to live in soon.” *This is not investment advice.

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor. The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K “This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance. “It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence. That’s what institutions have been waiting for,” Grachev told Cointelegraph during the Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on May 20, adding: “Stablecoins aren’t a crypto experiment anymore. They’re a better form of money. Faster, simpler, and more transparent than fiat.

2025-05-21T13:01:52.000Z,"Is BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT Becoming Too Big to Ignore?","Institutional interest in Bitcoin is evolving rapidly, with one issuer now emerging as the dominant player in the ETF space. And that’s BlackRock’s IBIT. As one fund pulls ahead of all others, questions emerge about whether institutional demand is being funneled into a monopoly. Bitcoin ETF Monopoly in the Making? Currently, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) holds over 636,000 BTC. This figure represents more than double the combined holdings of all other US spot Bitcoin ETFs . Since these products were approved in early 2024, IBIT has led the market in both capital inflows and BTC accumulation. While legacy products like Grayscale’s GBTC continue to bleed assets, IBIT’s meteoric rise suggests that institutional investors now view it as the primary vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. This concentration raises structural questions. CryptoQuant, in its latest analysis , notes that IBIT’s size reinforces its visibility and appeal to allocators who would view the largest fund as the most secure option. On the other hand, smaller ETFs face declining liquidity and relevance, which could lead to closures or mergers over time. This shift may result in a market increasingly reliant on a single institutional provider for access to Bitcoin. Drawing comparisons to the consolidation seen in Big Tech markets, CryptoQuant suggests that institutional capital may continue flowing to the most trusted and recognized name. IBIT’s dominance, the report concludes, is not only changing how institutions gain exposure to Bitcoin but also raising important questions about long-term market structure and concentration. “IBIT isn’t just winning – it’s redefining the playing field. If current trends continue, Bitcoin’s institutional narrative may become synonymous with BlackRock. Is this institutional trust – or a quiet monopoly in the making?” IBIT’s Momentum IBIT continues to gain favor among heavyweight investors. For instance, Mubadala Investment Company, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, boosted its stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF to 8.7 million shares in Q1 2025, adding nearly $29 million in stock. Citadel Advisors significantly increased its IBIT exposure in Q1 2025, more than tripling its holdings to over 3 million shares valued at roughly $147 million, a sharp rise from around 1 million shares in December, according to a recent filing. Additionally, Hong Kong-based Avenir Group expanded its position in the leading spot Bitcoin ETF in early 2025, as it grew its stake to 14.7 million shares by March 31, up from 11.3 million at the close of 2024.

2025-05-21T13:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Mining Startup Sangha Sees $42M Revenue as It Breaks Ground on West Texas Pilot Project","Sangha Renewables, a bitcoin BTC mining firm that aims to enable renewable energy companies to mine bitcoin, broke ground Wednesday on its flagship 19.9 megawatt (MW) solar facility in West Texas. “We have been extremely pleased with the development so far,” Spencer Marr, the firm’s president, told CoinDesk in a statement. “We made the decision to use our own funds to buy long lead time electrical infrastructure last November, even prior to the deal closing, to ensure we could be mining as soon as possible, and that has paid off.” “We also have a great team of partners and suppliers, including CSD Energy, EcoDigital, Moonshot Electrical, Fusion Industries, Greenhash and Pro Mining Solutions that have all pitched in to make this a success,” Marr added. Whereas most mining companies focus on acquiring mining rigs and seeking the cheapest electricity contracts possible to produce bitcoin, Sangha’s approach is markedly different : to convince large renewable energy companies to incorporate bitcoin mining into their own business models. The pitch is simple. Green energy projects often suffer from a mismatch in production and demand. A wind farm, for example, may generate a lot of electricity on a windy night — right when everyone is asleep and consumption is lowest. Instead of selling that surplus electricity at a loss, the affected company could potentially switch on bitcoin mining machines and turn a profit. The West Texas project is Sangha’s pilot program. For now, Sangha itself owns the miner through a series of subsidiaries, and purchases electricity from the energy company, though the energy company may eventually integrate the operation. The project is expected to generate $42 million in revenue in the first 12 months and mine roughly 900 bitcoin over the next 10 years. It will have access to electricity for anywhere between 2.8 cents and 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour on a 30-year lease, meaning that investors will be able to acquire bitcoin at a 25% to 50% discount. Construction is projected to close in the second half of July, though unforeseen events may push that back a month, Marr said. Bitcoin mining should begin soon as construction is complete. “We expect to commission the project over the summer and use that time to iron out any initial kinks,” Marr said. “We purposely ordered 2% more ASICs than we needed to give us a margin of error for faulty machines.” With $14 million raised so far through equity — partially thanks to Plural Energy, which enables mid-sized renewable energy projects to raise funds from investors on-chain — Sangha has secured 82% of its $17 million equity round target for the West Texas project. “By the fall, we expect to be a well-oiled machine and to be utilizing Plural Energy’s smart contract capabilities to stream distributions to our equity investors, who are excited by the idea of receiving distributions natively in bitcoin,” Marr said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/21/bitcoin-mining-startup-sangha-breaks-ground-on-west-texas-pilot-project,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Mining|Texas|News",cryptocompare

SukuPay’s infrastructure has been fully embedded inside the Zigi payment app, allowing Guatemalans to receive funds from the United States instantly for a $0.99 flat fee, the company disclosed on May 21. Users of the Zigi app do not need a crypto wallet or an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to receive the funds, the company said. SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph that the “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user” so that there are no technical barriers. “That’s the only way we’ll scale blockchain to billions of people — by building the rails, not forcing people to learn how they work,” said Lapchik. Established in 1968, Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations throughout Guatemala. As of 2023, it had over 150 million Guatemalan quetzals in assets, equivalent to roughly $20 million US.

Monthly remittances typically range from $131 to $648, representing between 6% and 23% of the sender’s average income. “Remittances are lifelines in this region, but they’re broken,” Lapchik told Cointelegraph. “Guatemala alone sees $21 billion in remittances every year, and families are losing 6% to 10% of that to fees and delays. These are people sending $300, $400 a month, and they can’t afford to wait days or pay that much just to get money home,” he said, adding: “Crypto solves this when it’s used the right way. It lets us move money instantly and at a fraction of the cost, integrated into the bank apps people already use.” Latin America is the second-fastest growing region in terms of crypto adoption, though Guatemala lags behind regional leaders Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, according to a 2024 Chainalysis study.

2025-05-21T12:57:31.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is This the Final Pullback Before a New All-Time High?","Bitcoin is once again pushing toward its all-time high after a strong continuation from the recent breakout. After breaking past $100K, the price is now consolidating below the ATH level, hinting at either a pause before further upside or potential exhaustion as funding and sentiment heat up. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has broken cleanly out of the descending channel and is now pressing into the $108K ATH resistance zone. The price is confidently trading above both the 100-day (orange) and 200-day (blue) moving averages, reflecting strong macro bullishness. The uptrend remains supported by higher lows and strong momentum, with the RSI trending in the overbought territory near 75. This does suggest potential for a short-term cooldown, but as long as the asset holds above the $100K zone, buyers remain firmly in control. A confirmed daily close above $108K would open the door for price discovery toward the next major psychological level around $115K.

The price is currently consolidating within this range, holding above the $104K fair value gap (imbalance), which can act as short-term support. The RSI has also cooled off slightly from overbought levels, but still signals bullish control. A clean breakout above $108K could accelerate price into new highs, while a breakdown below $104K would expose the $100K support zone for a potential retest. As long as the rising channel holds, short-term momentum favors the buyers. Sentiment Analysis Funding Rates From a sentiment perspective, funding rates across exchanges remain elevated. This suggests that the derivatives market is heavily skewed toward longs, and while this supports upward momentum, it also increases the risk of a squeeze if sentiment shifts. On the other hand, exchange reserves continue to decline, reinforcing the longer-term bullish thesis by showing that fewer coins are available to sell on exchanges. As the price pushes toward resistance with bullish derivatives sentiment and a supply-constrained environment, the next few days will be key in confirming whether this rally has more room or needs a deeper reset.

2025-05-21T12:57:14.000Z,"Russia moves to seize crypto: new bill classifies Bitcoin as property","The Russian Ministry of Justice is preparing a bill to classify crypto assets as property subject to possible confiscation. Russia is seeking to crack down on crypto-related crime with a new measure. According to local reports dated May 19, the Russian Ministry of Justice is drafting a bill that would classify crypto assets as property, making them subject to seizure in criminal proceedings. “The Ministry of Justice has developed a bill that classifies digital currency as property for the purposes of arrest and subsequent confiscation,” Deputy Minister of Justice, Vadim Fedorov. Fedorov noted that experts would be involved to ensure that these assets could be seized and securely handled. This includes confiscating physical wallets and the necessary credentials, such as seed phrases. Courts may also impose bans on wallet transactions. You might also like: Russia to establish crypto exchange for ‘super-qualified investors’ under a pilot regime Russians are increasingly turning to crypto for crime The proposed changes to seizure procedures come in response to the growing use of crypto by criminals in Russia. Authorities have cited the sale of drugs through anonymous darknet markets, often facilitated by crypto transactions, as a key concern. You might also like: Exploring crypto’s most notorious dark web cybercrime forum Fedorov acknowledged the unique challenges of seizing crypto assets and explained why such assets appeal to bad actors. “The attractiveness of this type of asset for criminals is explained by a number of factors, primarily anonymity and the lack of centralized control. Digital currency cannot be physically seized and placed in a safe, as is the case with cash and valuables,” Fedorov explained. One example is Russia’s darknet market Kraken, which has seen a 68% increase in crypto transactions. This comes despite a global crackdown on darknet platforms, including the shutdown of another Russian-based marketplace, Hydra, in April 2022. Since Hydra’s closure, Kraken, not to be confused with the regulated crypto exchange of the same name, has become the largest darknet market in Russia.

The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. U.S. publicly listed mining companies produced 3,277 bitcoin in April, a drop from the 3,534 coins that were mined in March, the report noted, and these firms accounted for 24.1% of the total network last month, versus 24.8% in the month previous. MARA Holdings (MARA) mined the most bitcoin, with 705 tokens, followed by CleanSpark (CLSK), which produced 633 BTC, Jefferies said.

2025-05-21T12:52:26.000Z,"Fake Uber Driver Allegedly Drugs and Robs American Tourist of $123K in Crypto in London","An American tourist visiting London claims he was abducted, drugged, and robbed of his life savings by a man posing as an Uber driver. Jacob Irwin-Cline, a 30-year-old former software developer from Oregon, says the assailant drained $123,000 worth of Bitcoin, XRP, and other digital assets from his crypto wallets during the early hours of May 9, local media outlet MyLondon initially reported on Wednesday. Tourist Lured into Fake Uber After Night Out in London Irwin-Cline had just left The Roxy nightclub in Soho after a night out when a driver, calling out the alias on his Uber account, flagged him down. Believing the car and driver matched the app details, he got into the vehicle. He now believes he was lured into a lookalike vehicle operated by a criminal linked to a fraudulent Uber account. The situation escalated after the driver offered Irwin-Cline a cigarette, which he suspects was laced with scopolamine — a powerful sedative known for its use in South American crimes. “I passed out for what I assumed to be 20 to 30 minutes,” he recalled. When he regained consciousness, he found himself injured on the side of a road in Golders Green, missing both his phone and memory of how he got there. By the time he returned to his hostel, his laptop had been wiped, and his digital assets had vanished. Screenshots provided to MyLondon show $73,000 worth of XRP and $50,000 in Bitcoin had been moved to various wallets. He believes the stolen funds were funneled through exchanges like MEXC and BTSE, but without insurance or a court order, recovery remains unlikely. The alleged robbery has been reported to the Metropolitan Police, Action Fraud, the FBI’s Virtual Assets Unit, and Uber. Authorities confirmed that an investigation is underway, but no arrests have been made. The Metropolitan Police said the report was filed the same morning, with cryptocurrency theft estimated at $150,000. Meanwhile, Irwin-Cline is staying in London to cooperate with authorities, though he holds little hope of recovering the stolen funds. “It’s virtually impossible to get that money back unless some weird miracle happens,” he said. Crypto Crime Turns Violent as Illicit Transactions Top $40B in 2024 Illicit cryptocurrency activity surged to at least $40.9 billion in 2024, according to Chainalysis, with the number likely to grow as more criminal-linked wallets are identified. Hacks alone accounted for $2.2 billion in stolen assets—a 21% increase from the previous year. North Korean-linked groups, including Lazarus and Tradetraitor, were behind over 60% of those thefts, with major incidents like the $300 million hack of Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange among their hits. But the threats go beyond online exploits. Criminal groups are using crypto to fund and conceal a wider range of crimes—from investment scams and AI-enhanced romance frauds to drug trafficking and even physical violence.

But despite this strong rally, the retail interest is still subdued. Wikipedia searches for cryptocurrencies are low again, even as Bitcoin briefly touched $108,000 level today. This shows that people are not very confident right now. Markets might be in a phase of disbelief or the excitement may have cooled off. Historically, big jumps in interest happened when the market was very excited and prices were at their highest. Low Bitcoin interest despite 6x price jump The search interest related to Bitcoin on Google Trends also remains low. This can be compared to the bear market period of 2022, when Bitcoin was trading only around $16,000. Despite Bitcoin’s price jumping 6x since 2022, the interest remains significantly low. Do Altcoin rallies trigger real retail hype? One X user observed that retail investors are not excited by Bitcoin’s price alone. Instead, they tend to jump in when altcoins skyrocket. The takeaway here is that altseason is when retail truly shows up, and that’s when big players use the hype to sell. Until that euphoric altcoin surge happens, the bull market is not over. This view also aligns with Matrixport’s take that most Bitcoin is being held by long-term investors and not everyday people. The lack of retail investors may explain why Google search interest for Bitcoin remains low, even as its price approaches record highs. Some in the crypto space see this as a bullish sign, calling it the “silence before the detonation.” Will The Rally Last? But it also raises concerns over the sustainability of the current rally as the markets may lack the liquidity needed for long-term growth. Still, the long term outlook is optimistic with bullish targets for Bitcoin.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-nears-all-time-highs-but-retail-interest-still-remains-low/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T12:44:52.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) holds Above final Resistance Level","The Bitcoin (BTC) price is gathering above the last decent resistance level of $106,000 on Wednesday. Should the bulls manage to close a daily candle above this level, and flip it into support, a rise up and beyond the $109,300 all-time high may not be far away. Positive factors for Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) is only a whisker away from recording an all-time high, the index of the biggest 500 US companies (S&P 500) is doggedly climbing back to all-time highs, and the tariff tantrums are probably mostly behind us. Economic indicators report chooses to focus on consumer sentiment However, the Leading Economy Index (LEI), a composite of several economic indicators, fell 1% in April, which is the biggest fall since March 2023, and it became the fifth monthly decline in a row. A report on the LEI by Newsweek declared that “consumers’ expectations for business conditions” was one of the most significant of the 10 economic components of the LEI. It also affirmed that “consumer sentiment” had consistently decreased since the beginning of 2025. While consumer sentiment certainly is a good yardstick for measuring how an economy is doing, the consumers themselves might be among the last to realise that the economy could be in the process of turning a corner, and that economic conditions may be about to pick up. Bullish or bearish short-term for $BTC? Source: TradingView In the short-term 4-hour time frame it can be seen that the $BTC price is flirting closely with the all-time high. Earlier on Wednesday the price ran up to touch $108,000, although it did get sold back down pretty quickly to the tentative $106,100 support level. If this support can hold by the end of the day on Wednesday it could become a base for bulls from which to launch that final assault on the all-time high. Notwithstanding, the current chart pattern of a rising channel is actually a bearish one. In the majority of cases, the price action would be expected to fall out of the bottom of the channel, rather than exit from the top. If the price does start to roll over from here and does fall through the bottom of the channel, a measured move could take $BTC back under $100,000 and down to around $97,000. Perhaps another more likely scenario could be a return to the support at $104,000, or even $102,000. Back to the more bullish scenario, the trend is still up, and a drop back to $106,000 is perfectly fine. If buyers do start getting behind a surge to the all-time high, this could be achieved in a very short amount of time. $DXY about to lose the $100 support Source: TradingView One chart that has a huge impact on the $BTC price is the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The chart shows that with only two days left in this current 2-week time frame, the DXY looks as though it could be about to lose the $100 horizontal support level. The Fibonacci levels for the move from early 2021 up to late 2022 very accurately provide support/resistance lines. The 0.618 is just below the current dollar price, while the 0.786 Fibonacci is likely to be a magnet for the price below this at $94.7. As the US dollar becomes weaker, which is one of the main targets for the Trump administration, asset prices should rise. A leading indicator in this case is probably Bitcoin. Expect the $BTC price to increase as the DXY steadily falls and becomes weaker. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-05-21T12:42:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Report from Crypto Firm Matrixport: 'Spot Demand Surges, Leverage Remains Limited!' Here Are the Details","Crypto financial services provider Matrixport announced in its market analysis dated May 21 that the Bitcoin (BTC) market is showing a historic trend again. Matrixport: Spot Demand Takes Precedence as Bitcoin Price Nears New High, Leverage Risk Limited According to the company’s assessment, while the Bitcoin price has recently approached record levels again, open positions in the futures market have also reached a historical peak of $34 billion. However, it is noteworthy that funding rates remain at almost zero. Spot Demand Is High, Leverage Is Limited According to Matrixport’s analysis, this trend shows that spot purchases are driving the market and this time the rise is more organic, not through leveraged transactions. The low funding rates indicate that there is no excessive speculative bubble in the market and therefore the risk of a correction accompanied by high volatility is reduced. The analysis also emphasized that the current market structure is progressing with relatively calm volatility. This reduces the possibility of investors encountering large price fluctuations in the short term. Matrixport’s assessment also points to a structural change in the Bitcoin market. According to the analysis, long-term investors are now leading the market instead of short-term speculators. This contributes to the formation of a more stable and sustainable market structure. This analysis highlights the role of institutional investors and spot market participants in Bitcoin’s recent uptrend, while also revealing that the risks of leverage-induced sudden declines remain low. *This is not investment advice.

The ratio between payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP and bitcoin's (BTC) dollar-denominated prices has triggered its first golden cross on the weekly chart, indicating a bullish shift in momentum. A golden cross occurs when the 50-day/week/month simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day/week/month SMA to indicate that the short-term trend is now outperforming the broader trend, with the potential to evolve into a major bull run. The crossover confirmed on XRP/BTC's weekly chart increased the likelihood of the ratio breaking out of its four-year-long sideways channel, hinting at a major XRP bull run relative to bitcoin. The ratio has been locked in a narrow sideways trend since late 2020, with regulatory uncertainty keeping XRP from cheering the crypto market bull run. However, last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its appeal against a favourable ruling for the XRP user Ripple, which established that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors on public exchanges. In other words, a significant obstacle has moved out of the way, clearing the path for a breakout, suggested by the golden cross. The potential breakout could trigger a substantial rally, driving valuations to record highs. Markets tend to build energy during consolidations, which is then released in the direction of the eventual breakout. Thus, the longer the consolidation, the more pronounced and rapid the resulting price movement is likely to be.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/21/xrp-btc-pair-flashes-first-golden-cross-hinting-at-major-bull-run-for-xrp,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|Markets|News",cryptocompare

CME—the world’s largest derivatives marketplace—debuted XRP futures contracts to much anticipation, and the opening day did not disappoint. According to prominent crypto analyst and influencer Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem, the first day saw a staggering $19 million in trading volume, highlighting strong institutional interest right out of the gate. XRP Futures Debut on CME With $19M Volume on the first day was quite good. Today, volume dipped a bit to about $7M. pic.twitter.com/yju7KzWaGS — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) May 21, 2025 CME’s XRP Futures: Key Contract Details and Trading Metrics The newly listed CME XRP futures contracts are standardized and regulated, offering a contract unit of 50,000 XRP, as defined by the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate (XRPUSD_RR). Contracts are quoted in U.S. dollars and cents per XRP, ensuring accessibility and transparency for participants familiar with other CME crypto derivatives like Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. These contracts are traded on CME Globex and cleared through CME ClearPort, with product codes XRB and XNB, respectively. The strong debut saw over 140 contracts traded on debut, representing approximately $19 million in notional volume—an impressive figure for a first-day listing. However, volume slightly tapered off the following day, with 59 contracts traded, amounting to roughly $7 million. While a dip from the opening day’s performance, it still indicates a healthy level of ongoing interest and adoption in institutional circles. Strategic Significance of CME Listing for XRP The inclusion of XRP in CME’s roster of cryptocurrency futures products marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset. XRP now joins the ranks of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the only other cryptocurrencies currently offered in CME’s derivatives suite. This listing is more than a market milestone—it symbolizes XRP’s evolving regulatory clarity and growing recognition among institutional players. CME’s decision to offer XRP futures is particularly significant against the backdrop of Ripple’s ongoing legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the case has posed hurdles for XRP’s broader adoption in the U.S., the move by CME adds institutional legitimacy and opens the door to more sophisticated trading strategies involving XRP, such as hedging, arbitrage, and leveraged exposure. Why Institutional Traders Are Taking Note The futures market has long been a barometer of institutional sentiment, and XRP’s entrance into this arena suggests that major financial players are either preparing to hedge positions or capitalize on the asset’s volatility. The structured nature of CME’s offering ensures compliance with U.S. financial regulations, giving hedge funds, asset managers, and proprietary trading desks a compliant gateway to XRP exposure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, CME’s reputation as a risk-averse and compliance-focused exchange indicates a belief in XRP’s long-term viability as a crypto asset with sufficient liquidity and institutional demand. Given that CME’s BTC and ETH futures have become reliable price discovery tools for the broader market, XRP’s inclusion could also impact how the market assesses XRP’s fair value going forward. The Road Ahead: Expanding XRP’s Institutional Narrative As the second day of trading saw a moderate dip in volume, market watchers are keeping a close eye on how volume trends evolve in the weeks ahead. If historical patterns from Bitcoin and Ethereum futures are any indication, XRP may see a gradual but consistent rise in volume as institutions gain confidence and integrate the product into their trading frameworks. This debut could also bolster Ripple’s efforts to present XRP as a bridge asset in the evolving world of blockchain-based finance. With XRP futures now active on CME, Ripple gains another data point in its argument that XRP functions as a commodity rather than a security, a classification at the heart of its battle with the SEC. The launch of XRP futures on the CME Group is a monumental development for both the asset and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Backed by robust trading volume on its first day and strong structural underpinnings, the futures product signals growing institutional acceptance and lays the groundwork for deeper liquidity and market maturity. As noted by Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem, this is not just another product launch—it’s a significant stride in XRP’s journey toward mainstream adoption and financial integration.

2025-05-21T12:07:59.000Z,"Unicoin Accused of $110M Fraud – What Best Altcoins to Buy Instead?","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed fraud charges against Unicoin and three of its senior executives over allegedly misleading 5K+ investors. According to the charges, the project promised that its token would be backed by billions worth of international real estate holdings. In reality, its assets were only worth a smidge of what was advertised, with the real proceeds amounting to just $110M, per the SEC. But despite regulatory pressure and controversy surrounding some new crypto projects, there’s no need to abandon crypto entirely. Some of the best altcoins to buy , like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and Monero ($XMR), stand out with real and audited utility cases. Despite a few bad apples, there’s still much to look forward to in crypto this year. Unicoin Falsely Touted Itself as ‘SEC-Registered,’ Filing Claims The Unicoin saga further stands out because it didn’t center on a traditional token sale but rather a complex scheme allegedly involving ‘rights certificates’ tied to unissued tokens. According to the SEC, these certificates were falsely touted as US-regulated and backed by hard assets. Coupled with asset misrepresentation and insiders cashing out, it’s no wonder the SEC is pushing for the project to be permanently banned and pay steep fines. The message for crypto investors is clear: due diligence is more important than ever. But not all cryptocurrencies are built on fiction. In fact, the failure of projects like Unicoin only reinforces the value of actually good altcoins worth buying. As the SEC tightens its grip, the future looks bright for tokens that are transparent, utility-driven, and compliant from the ground up, like $MIND , $BEST , and $XMR. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Proprietary AI Delivers Hot Crypto Trading Insights MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a trustworthy meme coin with real utility. It stands out for combining AI and blockchain tech to deliver exclusive crypto insights to its token holders. And this project isn’t just based on promises. Its in-house AI agent has been live online since May 10, 2025. Already, it’s scanning platforms like X, dApps, and on-chain activity to identify the hottest crypto trends and current market sentiment. The agent’s findings are already reaching $MIND holders, with some also automatically being distributed to the public via the agent’s X handle ( @MIND_agent ) and the project’s official Telegram channel . This is just part of the project’s roadmap. MIND continues to advance with further features in the pipeline: a persona-trained Large Language Model (LLM) , DEXScreener and Solana trackers, vector embeddings , and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) . Additionally, the MIND Terminal, a dashboard meant to supercharge $MIND holders’ trading tactics and insights, is also under development. Better still, MIND of Pepe’s compliance and transparency are evident. Audits by Coinsult and SOLIDProof have been live since the presale launched, and no critical vulnerabilities were found in the project’s smart contract. MIND of Pepe doesn’t have a mint function, blacklist, or honeypot settings, which minimizes the risk of abuses and scams like rugpulls . TokenSniffer also backs its legitimacy. Designed to funnel out scam tokens, it identifies that creators’ wallets hold less than 5% of its circulating token supply . This prevents the likelihood of sudden sell-offs and price crashes. With over $9.7M already raised and 1.4M+ $MIND staked (currently at a 234% APY), $MIND is building a credible foundation in a sector that’s often plagued by speculative hype and scams. Now’s your last chance to buy $MIND on presale for $0.0037515. The presale ends in 10 days, and our MIND of Pepe price prediction sees the coin possibly hitting $0.00535 (a ~35% increase) post-exchange listings. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Lower Fees & 116% Staking Rewards in Novel Non-Custodial Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the proprietary token of Best Wallet , one of the best software crypto wallets . Best Wallet is known for its anonymity and non-custodial key management, which makes it a private and transparent project from the get-go. What also gives Best Wallet a competitive edge is that it’s the first of its kind to feature a launchpad with the best crypto presales . Plus, the wallet is still working on adding new features, like real-time market insights and support for 80+ blockchains. To uncover all its perks, check out our Best Wallet review . $BEST is an altcoin worth buying for anyone wanting to leverage the crypto wallet app (available on iOS and Android). By holding $BEST, you can save on gas fees, vote on the ecosystem’s future trajectory, and receive greater staking rewards (currently at a 116% APY). But there’s more to $BEST than its utility, governance rights, and rewards. It’s also a secure buy, as shown through its smart contract, which Coinsult has audited . Underscoring the project’s commitment to transparency and security, Coinsult found neither high nor medium-risk vulnerabilities in $BEST’s contract. Moreover, the project’s whitepaper states that investors can cancel presale purchases within fourteen days, with only gas fees having to be paid. This inspires confidence and mirrors consumer protection principles often seen in more regulated financial environments. Considering that Best Wallet is also working to launch advanced anti-fraud and MEV protection , the ‘Best’ ecosystem sets trust as a top priority. To reap all the perks, buy $BEST on presale for $0.025055. Don’t miss this low-cap opportunity; the price could reach $0.072 (a +188% from its current value) following the token listing and Best Wallet’s upcoming app developments. Check our Best Wallet Token price prediction for more details. 3. Monero ($XMR) – Hits Over $316 as the Demand for Privacy On-Chain Grows Monero ($XMR) has jumped by over 7% since last week, bringing its price to a commendable $361+. The coin’s strong emphasis on anonymous, untraceable transactions helps spur its demand. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where all transactions are publicly visible, Monero uses advanced cryptographic techniques (like ring signatures and stealth addresses) to ensure privacy and fungibility. Its privacy features undoubtedly make compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) laws challenging. However, Monero’s codebase is open source, enabling audits and scrutiny by researchers and regulators. Cyberscope, for instance, audited the $XMR smart contract and found that it’s ‘very low risk,’ given its: Zero honeypot behaviour; Verified source code; MIT license ; No proxy or upgradeability risks; Lack of suspicious functions. The Monero community also actively discusses compliance in forums like the Monero Research Lab . They work alongside academics to improve transparency without compromising privacy. You can buy $XMR on some of the best crypto exchanges , such as MEXC. The Best Altcoins to Buy Thrive by Upholding Trust and Security The Unicoin controversy underscores the dire need for transparency and verified utility in the crypto sector. But it also strengthens the case for community-first crypto projects. As bad actors like Unicoin grab industry attention, so do the best altcoins with proven utility and strong security audits. From AI-powered trading insights to cheaper trading fees and anonymous payments, $MIND , $BEST , and $XRP lead by example (not false promises). Nevertheless, always DYOR before making any investments. This information doesn’t constitute financial advice. Even the best altcoins to buy can fluctuate wildly, especially post-exchange listings.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-unicoin-accused-of-110m-fraud/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T12:06:56.000Z,"Robert Kiyosaki Warns of Economic Collapse, Says Bitcoin Could Hit $1 Million","The post Robert Kiyosaki Warns of Economic Collapse, Says Bitcoin Could Hit $1 Million appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Famous author and economist Robert Kiyosaki has once again raised serious concerns about the U.S. economy. In his latest tweet, he claims “The End is Here”, pointing to a failed U.S. bond auction and warning of coming hyperinflation. But while the message may sound scary, he also shares hope, and for him, that hope is Bitcoin . FED Bond Auction – No One Attended At the center of his warning is a bond auction that reportedly saw very little participation. Kiyosaki explained that the U.S. government recently held an auction to sell its bonds, but no one showed up to buy. Usually, investors or countries buy these bonds to help fund government operations. But this time, according to Kiyosaki, the U.S. Federal Reserve itself quietly stepped in to buy $50 billion worth of bonds, using money it simply created. THE END is HERE: WHAT if you threw a party and no one showed up? That is what happened yesterday. The Fed held an auction for US Bonds and no one showed up. So the Fed quietly bought $50 billion of its own fake money with fake money. The party is over. Hyperinflation is… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 21, 2025 He calls this “fake money buying fake assets,” and says it’s a sign that the financial system is in big trouble. Hyperinflation Could Be Next He didn’t hold back from predicting what comes next. “Hyperinflation is here,” he said. When governments keep printing money to cover their spending, it weakens the value of that money. Kiyosaki believes this will lead to hyperinflation, where prices go up very fast and people’s savings lose value quickly. He warns that “millions, young and old” could lose everything if they’re not prepared. The dollar, he says, is on the edge of collapse. Gold, Silver… and Bitcoin to the Rescue? Despite the bad news, Kiyosaki still sees a way to protect your future. He predicts that as the dollar weakens, people will turn to hard assets, things with real value. He believes gold will reach $25,000, silver will hit $70, and Bitcoin could soar to between $500,000 and $1 million. That’s a huge jump, but in his view, it’s not just possible, it’s likely. Why Bitcoin Stands Out Kiyosaki has long supported Bitcoin. He believes it’s a safe way to protect your money because no government controls it, and there’s only a limited amount of it. Recently, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 this year. Right now, Bitcoin is close to its highest-ever price, trading around $106,651, with a total market value of $2.11 trillion.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-financial-collapse-is-here-can-bitcoin-save-you/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-21T12:04:40.000Z,"Bitcoin edges toward price-discovery, analysts flag sub $130k target","Bitcoin climbed to $108,000 on 21 May, edging within 1.5 % of January’s record and stoking talk of a breakout. A flash dip of around $1,000 shortly after the surge underlined the market’s volatility, yet bulls quickly regrouped as order-book data showed thickening bid walls near $106,000. Traders now treat $109,356 on Bitstamp as the final psychological barrier before true price-discovery kicks in. Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe called the level a “point of interest” and argued that reclaiming it could ignite a run toward $116,000 and beyond. “It’s always a good morning with Bitcoin at $108,000 and close to a new ATH,” he said on X. Support zones firm up Keith Alan of Material Indicators said multiple moving averages and the 2025 yearly open are coalescing into a “formidable support block” between $100,000 and $102,000. “The 50-Day MA is on a trajectory to golden-cross the 200-Day MA,” he noted, adding, “You can’t really ask for stronger technical support than that.” Alan conceded a retest of $100,000 would be healthy but now sees that scenario as increasingly unlikely if momentum holds. Meanwhile, trader Merlijn interprets the recent consolidation as a bullish pennant and points to a technical target of $116,000. Others, including analyst Henry, set their sights even higher, forecasting a $128,000 “blow-off top” should liquidity remain skewed to the buy side. Macro tailwinds boost sentiment The rally coincides with risk-on flows in global markets after US CPI eased for a second straight month and the Federal Reserve signaled patience on further tightening. Institutional demand also remains robust; spot-Bitcoin ETFs recorded a sixth consecutive week of net inflows, with BlackRock’s IBIT alone pulling in more than $1 billion over the period. On-chain metrics echo the optimism as dormant supply trends upward and active addresses climb to their highest level since March. Options data from Deribit shows a growing cluster of open interest at $120,000-strike calls for June expiry, underscoring trader conviction that fresh records are imminent. Still, skeptics warn that funding rates on perpetual futures are near three-month highs, raising the risk of a flush if spot prices stall below resistance. Even so, the prevailing narrative is that a clean break above $110,000 would drag short sellers into an aggressive round of liquidations, potentially catapulting BTC toward the oft-cited $128,000 ceiling before any meaningful pullback.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-edges-toward-price-discovery-analysts-flag-sub-130k-target/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

This surge can be largely attributed to the successful launch of the Pectra upgrade , which significantly boosted investor confidence. Coincidentally, this upgrade also coincided with a positive geopolitical development, which was on May 8th, the US and UK announced a trade deal , marking a historic first. The mere certainty of this agreement sent optimism wave to all altcoins and top coins. Even Arthur Hayes, in a recent interview , agrees that more than technical factors, the sentimental factors led the rise in ETH crypto. He believes that still ETH price presents a unique investment opportunity. Hayes even sets an ambitious target of $5,000 for Ethereum, suggesting that by the end of the year, a price of $10,000 could be within reach. Regardless of the challenges ahead, Ethereum appears poised to play a significantly important role in the crypto landscape of 2025.

Keep reading to know more. Arthur Hayes Predicts Ethereum Price Run To $10,000 In a recent macro-focused interview on the Bankless podcast, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX and current CIO of Maelstrom, shared his optimistic Ethereum price Forecast. He suggested that if ETH price surpasses $5,000, it could have potential projection to $10,000 or even $15,000 by the end of the year. This ETH price prediction came during a final discussion in the interview when he asked where Hayes sees ETH price this year. In the video, when talked about the second top crypto next to BTC recent run in May, Hayes attributed the ETH price performance to market sentiment rather than any significant technical factors. He noted that the Ethereum price resurgence was long overdue, especially after being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens in recent years. However, he cautioned that Ethereum crypto’s journey may not be straightforward. While acknowledging ETH crypto’s underperformance compared to Bitcoin thus far, he strongly believes that the Ethereum price moment is approaching. This is especially due to regulatory clarity seems higher chance of improving or if decentralized finance (DeFi) regains momentum with sustainable cash flows. He highlighted projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that could finally validate their valuations based on fundamentals. As the interview wrapped up, the host inquired about Hayes’ personal holdings. He revealed that his crypto portfolio consists of approximately 60% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum, along with a variety of other altcoins and tokens. On the non-crypto side, he mentioned holding physical gold, gold mining stocks, and T-bills.

On the daily price chart, the Ethereum price is currently fluctuating between key resistance and support levels, with mixed signals from technical indicators. After a notable bull run in May, momentum appears to be waning, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated from the overbought territory, now sitting at 68.70. At present, ETH price is priced at $2,528, accompanied by an intraday trading volume of $23.47 billion. The future movement of the Ethereum price hinges on its ability to break through the $2,800 resistance level. Moreover, on-chain data also adds to the optimism, as highlighted in CryptoQuant’s weekly crypto report . The relative price of ETH compared to Bitcoin may have reached a bottom, potentially signaling the onset of an “Alt season.” The ETH/BTC price ratio has surged by 38% over the past week, following a dip to its lowest point since January 2020. Historically, this ratio has indicated a relative bottom for Ethereum, often leading to broader outperformance among altcoins.

Source: cryptoquant In the past, similar conditions in 2017, 2018, and 2019 were followed by significant periods of Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting a strong potential for mean reversion. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

VanEck said Tuesday it will launch the PurposeBuilt Fund in June to invest in tokenized businesses building on Avalanche ( AVAX ) and focused on long-term value and utility. In a press release shared with crypto.news, the New York-headquartered asset manager said the fund will back liquid tokens and venture-backed crypto projects in sectors such as gaming , payments, AI , and financial services — primarily around or after a token generation event. The fund will also deploy idle capital on-chain through Avalanche-native real-world asset products, such as tokenized money market funds. Pranav Kanade, portfolio manager of the VanEck Digital Assets Alpha Fund, said the fund won’t chase hype or short-term trends, as the next wave of value in “crypto will come from real businesses, not more infrastructure.” Read more: VanEck launches ‘NODE’ ETF targeting blockchain stocks and crypto-linked assets “Avalanche has become a magnet for thoughtful builders, and with the VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund, we’re bringing capital and conviction to the founders creating lasting value, not chasing momentum.” Pranav Kanade The new vehicle will be managed by the team behind the VanEck Digital Assets Alpha Fund, which has over $100 million in assets under management and launched in 2022. The announcement comes amid growing institutional interest in Avalanche, with Grayscale recently filing to convert its Avalanche Trust, launched in August 2024, into a spot exchange-traded fund. In late March, the firm submitted a 19b-4 filing to Nasdaq to list the fund and offer regulated exposure to AVAX, though it still requires SEC approval.

2025-05-21T12:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Depot: Q1 Was Fundamentally Solid","Summary Bitcoin Depot's Q1 showcased strong operational momentum with revenue climbing 19% YoY to $164.2, adjusted gross margin expanding by 7.7 percentage points, and adjusted EBITDA tripling to $20.3 million. Despite improved operating cash flow, the Company's balance sheet remains structurally fragile, with a shareholders' deficit of approximately $4.6 million due to liabilities exceeding assets. Operational focus is shifting from rapid fleet expansion to maximizing unit economics by optimizing the existing BTM network, with second-year kiosks reportedly generating around 50% more revenue. Valuation remains highly attractive relative to peers, with forward P/S around 0.1x, EV/EBITDA around 2.7x, and forward P/E of about 5x. Bitcoin Depot (BTM), the world's largest operator of Bitcoin ATMs also called Bitcoin Teller Machines or BTMs, has been showing sustainable operational improvements and financial stability. Bitcoin Depot's business model is pretty straightforward, it is basically like an on-ramp and off-ramp physical infrastructure for cash-to-Bitcoin and Bitcoin-to-cash conversions. The company also runs a mobile application, BDCheckout, which enables users to load cash for purchasing at participating retail stores. Bitcoin Depot Q1 results were announced last week, and they were a continuation of the improvements seen in previous quarters. I think the reshuffling of the executive bench earlier this year - a new CFO and a new Chief Legal Officer (bringing experience in legal and compliance strategy to support the company's expansion efforts) - and a stronger push into international markets beyond the U.S. are beginning to yield operational results. Q1 top line came in at $164.2 million, up 19% YoY. The margin also expanded, with adjusted gross margin climbing by 7.7 percentage points to 20.2% from 12.5% in Q1 last year. Adjusted EBITDA more than tripled to $20.3 million, while the company swung to a net income of $12.2 million from a $4.2 million net, the same period last year. Operational cash flow also flipped meaningfully positive at $16.3 million, compared to just $1.3 million last year. This performance couldn't have been announced at a better time than during a market wide recovery and Bitcoin's rally month - in the crypto community they say \""Bitcoin loves May\"" because May has been a historically good month for Bitcoin and crypto. Bitcoin is up 24% on the monthly and BTM is up 112%. Most of the gains BTM has printed (over 70% in a week) have been since earnings were released last week (over 30% upside since earnings). Data by YCharts BTM exhibits some sympathy play with Bitcoin's price movement, meaning when Bitcoin is up, BTM also typically records gains and vice versa. Though, BTM's correlation coefficient with Bitcoin is way more modest compared to that of Bitcoin mining stocks like MARA Holdings ( MARA ) or Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), or that of highly leveraged Bitcoin plays like Strategy ( MSTR ). Bitcoin Depot's transaction volume has historically been and remains decoupled from Bitcoin prices. This could explain why while most Bitcoin miners that have reported Q1 earnings this month faced compressed margins and increased operational cost, Bitcoin Depot's Q1 was surprisingly strong and margin-accretive despite the tariff volatility that rocked the market in Q1. Bitcoin Depot I, however, think this uncorrelation in the financials with Bitcoin price will likely change in the long term if Bitcoin Depot's BTC treasury increases to a material figure, as unrealized gains or losses will be recorded directly on the income statement based on the newly adopted FASB fair value rule. Thus, BTC price will begin to impact headline earnings, even if the core BTM business remains operationally distinct. As of Q1 end, Bitcoin Depot held 94.4 BTC in treasury, amounting to ~$10 million as of today's BTC spot price, of which 83 BTC were acquired in Q1. The company has said resources for BTC purchases for treasury will remain opportunistic. What is Driving Bitcoin Depot's Operational Momentum Bitcoin Depot is shifting focus toward optimizing its existing fleet of BTMs rather than rapidly expanding for expansion's sake. Bitcoin Depot deployed fewer new BTMs in Q1 2025 compared to some prior quarters. 250 new BTMs were deployed in Q1, and this is a sharp drop compared to 2024 where an ample amount of capital was allocated to BTM purchases. By Q2 last year, one of the key announcements was the deployment of 8,000 new BTMs. ...kiosks in year two versus year one, typically see at least 50% growth in terms of revenue versus year one. - CEO Brandon Mintz, during Q1 earnings call Q&A It seems less cash will be going out to buy new BTMs in the interim, as management emphasized that kiosks in their second year of deployment typically generate 50% more revenue than in their first year. And I think the reason for this could be anywhere from new Kiosks becoming indexed over time in Google Maps and third-party locator apps, which increases traffic organically, or it could be location-specific adoption or familiarization dynamics, where over time, more people notice the machine, try it, and then return as repeat users, thereby boosting transaction volume. So Bitcoin Depot's focus will be on maximizing unit economics and throughput of the current fleet (I see OpEx not going down much soon because heavy marketing might be needed to achieve this) rather than expanding the footprint aggressively. And this strategy is even more viable for the company now that operating cash flow has improved greatly to $16.3 million in Q1, and this gives the company potential more internal liquidity to reinvest selectively and strengthen the balance sheet. Data by YCharts Examining Bitcoin Depot's financials, I'd say the only concerns for investors will be the negative equity currently on the balance sheet . MRQ data shows $89.7 million in total assets (of which cash and cash equivalent make up around $35 million) and $94.3 million in total liabilities, resulting in a shareholders' deficit of ~$4.6 million. Q1 interest expense (Bitcoin Depot) Though Bitcoin Depot covered its Q1 interest expense and can comfortably meet its interest obligations from earnings, as EBIT in Q1 was $10.52 million and interest expense for the quarter was $3.07 million, putting the interest coverage ratio at 3.4x. I believe, the over 3x interest coverage ratio shouldn't be an outright comfort signal for investors, considering the negative equity which still reflects a structurally fragile balance sheet. An interest coverage ratio at 3.4x is still solid on its own, but it doesn't fully offset the broader balance sheet risks. How Do We Value BTM Bitcoin Depot currently enjoys way lower valuation multiples compared to other Bitcoin stocks because BTM has long been beaten down among Bitcoin stocks. Seems the market has underappreciated the infrastructural role of the company in the broader crypto economy compared to how the market rewards Bitcoin miners or Bitcoin leverage bets. Seeking Alpha But I'm not taking the low multiples at face value and would strongly consider the multiples from the angle of BTM's fully diluted share count of 124.7 million, which includes over 60 million potentially dilutive securities of public and private placement warrants, earn out shares, and RSUs. If exercised or vested, could nearly double the current outstanding share count of ~64 million. Outstanding share data (Bitcoin Depot) But irrespective of how you adjust the valuation, BTM's P/S ratio will be around 0.18x and forward P/S will be around 0.2x. EV/EBITDA will be around 4.5x, and forward P/E will be around 13x. BTM's multiples are still extremely attractive compared to virtually all other publicly traded Bitcoin companies. Data by YCharts Rating and Takeaway On BTM's current momentum, a Q1 pre-earnings review would have been a better time to recommend a Buy. The stock is already up over 30% since earnings, and I think the initial boost the earnings have given will likely stall a bit here, and upside could be limited in the near term. If BTM reports continued sales, margin, and operating cash flow strength in Q2 (they are guiding for sales growth of mid-single-digits in Q2) and deleveraging progress makes equity become positive on the balance sheet, this will restore more confidence in investors and make BTM ready for a more sustained upside. Considering the upside already seen on the weekly (since earnings), a Hold is the more prudent call here, as we watch how balance sheet repair and operating leverage unfold in Q2.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4788743-bitcoin-depot-q1-was-fundamentally-solid?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","MARA|RIOT|MSTR|BTMWW|BTM",cryptocompare

Optimized Borrowing Experience with Multi-Asset Collateral Loan efficiency and asset liquidity have always been two major user-focused concerns. As a key highlight of this upgrade, HTX’s “Crypto Loans 2.0” introduces a multi-asset collateral mechanism, supporting over 20 mainstream cryptocurrencies as collateral assets, including USDT, BTC, ETH, TRX, DOGE, XRP, SOL, and AVAX. This significantly boosts users’ asset utilization efficiency.

Another standout feature of this upgrade is HTX’s limited-time offer: an ultra-low 0.09% annual interest rate for BTC Flexible Loans, with borrowing limits up to 100 BTC. This remarkable rate represents a 555-fold reduction from the previous annual rate of over 5.0%, making it an exceptional deal.

2025-05-21T11:46:01.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – May 21, 2025","The rally shows no signs of slowing down. While overall market cap saw a slight 0.6% dip to $3.48 trillion, most of the top 100 coins have continued climbing – powered by growing institutional interest and a wave of favorable regulatory momentum. Total crypto trading volume remains strong at $123 billion, highlighting the market’s resilience and renewed investor confidence. TLDR: The crypto market continues the rally, despite the decrease in market cap; Bitcoin is in the green today, up 1.25% in 24 hours; Analysts highlight the strength of the market recovery; ‘Setting the Stage for New ATH’; Significant ETF inflows and regulatory developments fuel the rally; The rally seems sustainable, though short-term corrections and consolidations are possible. Why Is Crypto Up Today – May 21, 2025: Crypto Winners & Losers Compared to yesterday, when all the top 10 coins per market cap were green, one turned red today. Tron (TRX) fell 0.7% to the price of $0.2711. Founder Justin Sun tweeted out his support for US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, saying he’ll be attending the latter’s Gala Dinner. Cardano (ADA) is the day’s best performer. It’s up 3%, now trading at $0.7539. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated 0.8%, now changing hands at $2,553. Its daily high is $2,635. Furthermore, after briefly hitting the day’s high of $107,831, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back to the $106,500 level. Over the past day, it increased by 1.4%, trading at $106,533. Notably, this is its yesterday’s high, which it finally managed to hold. Also, the majority of the top 100 coins saw their prices increase. The highest gainer in this category is Stacks (STX) , having increased by 7.1% to $0.9106. Story (IP) fell the most among the red coins. It’s down 3.7% to $4.49 Overall, the crypto market rally continues to be fueled by the increase in institutional adoption, surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows, regulatory shifts, and ongoing macroeconomic relief following the easing of trade tensions. In turn, this has fueled risk-on sentiment. Furthermore, the regulation is currently favorable for crypto. All eyes are at the moment primarily on the US. The country’s Senate has voted to advance the GENIUS Act , which would regulate stablecoins at the federal level. The Senate advanced the GENIUS Act with a 66-32 bipartisan vote on Monday, marking a big step toward establishing federal regulation for stablecoins and digital currency oversight. #GENIUSAct #Stablecoins https://t.co/JmoPuWjKdf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins faced questions from lawmakers on 20 May. They focused on the regulator’s handling of the fraud case involving Tron founder Justin Sun and a Donald Trump-linked meme coin. It remains to be seen if this will have a more pronounced impact on the market. Chairman Paul Atkins will testify before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government today at 10 a.m. ET. A livestream will be available: https://t.co/QDPSVDHlCR — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 20, 2025 ‘Setting the Stage for New ATH’ According to the latest Glassnode report, BTC has hit a local high of $107,000, moving close to its all-time high of $109,000. This has led to a significant increase in capital inflows. It has pushed the Realized Cap above $900 billion, “for the first time, a historic milestone.” Only four trading days in history have recorded a higher daily closing price. The last weekly close of $106,500 was the highest ever. The coin is trading some 40% higher over the last six weeks, “highlighting how strong the market recovery has been,” the analysts say. Source: Glassnode Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler , has commented that BTC may have entered a consolidation phase, marked by accumulation. The current price action could be “setting the stage for another leg higher that could lead to a new all-time high.” He commented that the $90,000–$110,000 range is a key consolidation zone, as BTC has spent significant time within this range since November. “This suggests a high concentration of trading activity and order volume, which could reinforce the area as a strong support level. If this dynamic continues, Bitcoin will likely remain anchored in this range, even following the renewal of all-time highs, as it serves as a psychologically and technically important price corridor.” Lienkha noted the existing risk of a downside correction but added that the chances are “relatively low in the short to medium term.” While it’s too early to declare the beginning of a full-scale altseason, the executive says, Ethereum has seen notable outperformance. This is the result of internal factors, including the Pectra upgrade and the expansion of stablecoins on the network, supported by a favorable macroeconomic environment. Levels & Events to Watch Next After two days of unsuccessful attempts, BTC finally managed to break through the $106,000 level, rising above $106,500. More importantly, at the time of writing, it is holding that level. This shows how today’s brief high can become tomorrow’s price in the market’s push-and-pullback game. The coin couldn’t sustain the day’s high of $107,800. However, if it manages to surpass $107,000 and stay there, the next level to keep an eye on will be $108,786, after which it will likely be testing fresh all-time highs. Per Glassnode, the $2,400–$2,900 range is a crucial zone for Ethereum. This is both a resistance zone and a potential breakout level, “essential for maintaining upward momentum.” Source: Glassnode Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has recorded a slight increase since this time yesterday, from 68 to 69, going deeper into the greed territory. As previously noted, this signals investor optimism, confidence, and willingness to take risks as a result of higher prices and trading volumes. That said, it can also lead to overconfidence and overvaluation, which typically precede a correction. Notably, the market continues to be fueled by significant investor interest and exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflows. On May 20, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of $329.02 million . This is its fifth consecutive day of inflows. The cumulative total net inflow reached $42.77 billion. Also, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $64.89m in net inflows, for a third day of positive flows, resulting in the cumulative inflow of $2.59 billion. Additionally, major alternative asset manager Blackstone invested in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) , thus entering the crypto space via an ETF. According to the 20 May filing, as of 31 March, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares, 9,889 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) , and 4,300 shares of the ATM operator Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM) . According to a recent portfolio filing, Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund disclosed holding 23,094 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of March 31.

While crypto has maintained its bull run, stocks went the other way under pressure from rising Treasury yields, ending six consecutive sessions of gains. The S&P 500 is down 0.39%, the Nasdaq-100 fell 0.37%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a decrease of 0.27%. With the rising concerns over inflation and interest rate hikes, investors seek refuge elsewhere. The stocks are pushed down by Trump’s efforts to pass a tax-cut bill that could add $3 trillion-$5 trillion to the government’s debt of $36.2 trillion. Is this rally sustainable? The rally seems strong. It is encouraged by strong fundamentals, primarily institutional demand, significant regulatory developments, and macroeconomic tailwinds. That said, there may be a potential regulatory shift ahead, as well as growing greed that could signal short-term corrections. Alternatively, the market could be seeing a consolidation period.

2025-05-21T11:45:42.000Z,"Arthur Hayes Gives Portfolio Update, Says ‘Nasty Correction’ Could Be Approaching This Year for Crypto","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is offering an update on the current holdings of his family office Maelstrom Fund. In a new interview on the Bankless YouTube channel, Hayes says the crypto portfolio of his family office is dominated by the two largest crypto assets by market cap. “Maelstrom [Fund] is about like 60% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum. And then a lot of other shitcoins, term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it’s physical gold and gold miners. And treasury bills. That’s it.” Over the coming weeks, the BitMEX co-founder says Bitcoin ( BTC ) could appreciate by up to 138% from the current level before 2026. “I think we’re going to go on a run to like in the $150,000 to $200,000 range between now and sort of like maybe sometime in the summer. We will get some nasty correction and then I think we go to $250,000 on Bitcoin by the end of the year.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,070 at time of writing. On his price targets for Ethereum ( ETH ), Hayes says, “Ethereum… I think if we can get to $5,000 by the end of the year, I will probably be good. That will sort of reinvigorate people and maybe you know ETH gets to $10,000 or $20,000 by the end of the run. But I think that there’s a hard slog between here and $5,000 for ETH.” Ethereum is trading at $2,513 at time of writing. The BitMEX co-founder further says altcoins will also experience a bullish run. “There will be an alt season. It might not be the alts that you own. It might not be the overvalued venture capital high-FDV [fully diluted valuation] low-float piece of shitcoin with no clients coin that you own. But there will be new narratives, there always will be. There will be a new hot thing that everybody’s slinging on the decentralized exchanges.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

As a result, the crypto market cap registered an increase of nearly 1% and moved to $3.37 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from its sluggish start to the week, recouping its losses on Tuesday and crossing $107,000 during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $107,301. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) registered a marginal increase to maintain its position above $2,500. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is on the verge of reclaiming $2,600. Despite the positive market sentiment, Ripple (XRP) has registered a marginal decline, while Solana (SOL) is marginally up over the past 24 hours, trading around $171. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) also registered notable increases. Dow Drops As Wall Street Momentum Stalls The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.27%, and the S&P 500 dropped 0.39%, ending a six-day upward trend. The Nasdaq Composite also dropped 0.38% as mega caps and chipmakers retreated, with Nvidia, AMD, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft registering notable losses. The pullback comes after a five-week rebound that saw the S&P 500 rise over 20% from its April low. The rebound was driven by optimism around tariff de-escalation and reduced US-China trade tensions. Bill Northey, US Bank Wealth Management, stated, “We’ve had the swoon related to tariffs, the furious rally, and now we’re awaiting clarification. It’s optimism without clarity.” Bond markets have added to the recent uncertainty, with the 10-year Treasury yield climbing to 4.48%, while the 30-year Treasury yield crossed 5% for the second day running. The jump comes after Moody’s decision to downgrade US Debt, citing rising deficits and interest expenses. Bancor Sues Uniswap For Patent Infringement Bprotocol Foundation and LocalCoin, the entities behind the Bancor Protocol and the BNT token, have filed a lawsuit against Uniswap. The platforms filed the lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The entities have accused Uniswap of infringing patents around smart contracts used in decentralized trading. Bancor alleged that Uniswap used its patented technology that underpins the constant product automated market maker (CPAMM), the core mechanism powering the Uniswap protocol. Bancor stated in a press release, “When an organization continuously uses our invention without our authorization and does so as a means of competing with us, we must take action.” Bancor has claimed Uniswap used its technology for over eight years without permission. Bancor patented its decentralized trading technology in 2017. The same technology was used to power its AMM-powered DEX protocol. The Bprotocol Foundation and LocalCoin claim they own all rights to their invention. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) came within touching distance of its all-time high before declining to its current levels as the flagship cryptocurrency finally broke past key resistance levels around $105,000 and $106,000. BTC started the week in the red, dropping to a low of $102,145 before settling at $105,573. Despite selling pressure, BTC rose over 1% on Tuesday before climbing to an intraday high of $108,010 during the ongoing session. The increase brought BTC within 1% of its all-time high after it broke out of a two-week-long consolidation phase, which saw the price hover between $100,000 and $105,000. BTC’s jump above $105,000 has been fueled by several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Investors have lost confidence in traditional financial systems, while cooling trade war tensions and tariff concerns have fueled a risk-on sentiment, pushing investors towards risk assets. Persistent inflation has eroded purchasing power, while the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance has kept real yields on the higher side. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also registered steady inflows, indicating a resurgence in institutional interest. Analysts believe BTC bulls are eying the $110,000 level after forming a strong base around $106,000 thanks to solid buyer interest at lower levels. If BTC maintains its position above $105,000-$106,000, the price could surge to a new all-time high. Ruslan Lienkha, head of markets at YouHodler, stated, “While the risk of a downside correction cannot be ruled out, particularly if negative sentiment returns to the equity markets, the likelihood of such a scenario remains relatively low in the short to medium term.” Let’s look at BTC’s price action over the past few sessions. BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.72% to $104,617, but lost momentum on Sunday and settled at $103,802. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a drop of 1.04% and settled at $102,728. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to reclaim $104,000 and settle at $104,123. However, it was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 0.53% and settling at $103,568. Source: TradingView BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday but rebounded to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action remained bearish on Thursday and Friday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. The price recovered on Sunday as markets rebounded, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,479. BTC started the week on a bearish note, plunging to a low of $102,145 before rebounding to settle at $105,573, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as the price rose 1.21% to $106,855. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If buyers regain control, BTC could cross $109,000 and set a new all-time high. On the other hand, sellers will look to drive the price below $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) bounced back to reclaim $2,500 and briefly crossed $2,600 despite experiencing considerable volatility at the start of the week. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency faced significant selling pressure at the beginning of the week as it fell to a low of $2,349 on Monday before recovering to reclaim $2,500. Despite recent volatility, SOL has registered a hugely positive month, with its price up over 50%. SOL has held on to its recent gains and maintained its position above the $2,500 level. Market watchers are also bullish on Ethereum. Arthur Hayes believes that a move to $10,000 or even $15,000 is a realistic prediction for ETH as global liquidity shifts and capital controls take hold. Hayes dismissed technical triggers behind ETH’s rally and highlighted positive sentiment around the asset, stating, “The most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle. It’s just human nature.” Hayes believes an ETH comeback was long overdue it spent years overshadowed by SOL and other Layer2 tokens. “ETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running… it was time.” ETH ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 3% and settling at $2,514. It faced volatility on Monday, rising to an intraday high of $2,623 and falling to an intraday low of $2,408 before settling at $2,496, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Despite the bearish sentiment, ETH recovered on Tuesday, rising over 7% to surge past $2,600 and settle at $2,682. However, ETH lost momentum after this level. As a result, the price fell nearly 3% on Wednesday and settled at $2,610. Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price plunged 2.38%, slipping below $2,600 and settling at $2,548. ETH reached an intraday high of $2,648 on Friday as buyers attempted a move towards $2,700. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $2,537 after a marginal decline.

Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) registered a noticeable uptick on Tuesday, rising to an intraday high of $173 before settling at $168. The Ethereum-killer is looking to hold on to recent gains and build momentum to reclaim the $170 level. The price flashed a bearish flip after breaking below $170 on Monday when it fell to a low of $159 before reclaiming $160. Despite the selling pressure, the price has remained above $165. SOL remains confined within the $160-$180 range as bulls look to build momentum and push the price higher. SOL ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 3% to $173. It encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $174. SOL plunged to an intraday low of $165 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 5.50% to cross $180 and settle at $183.

SOL continued to drop on Friday despite rising to an intraday high of $174, settling at $167, ultimately registering a fall of almost 1%. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish on Saturday as SOL fell 0.89% to $165.

2025-05-21T11:35:18.000Z,"Bitcoin Hits $108K, Just 2% from ATH, But Could It Really Crash to $2000?","The post Bitcoin Hits $108K, Just 2% from ATH, But Could It Really Crash to $2000? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is making headlines after crossing $108,000 today, marking its highest level in four months. The leading cryptocurrency just broke out of a strong bullish pattern, and traders are now eyeing the $116,000 mark as the next big target. With strong momentum building and multi-month charts showing no bearish signals, many believe a new all-time high could be right around the corner. But amid the excitement, some experts are sounding the alarm on what could come next. Could Bitcoin Crash to $2,000? While Bitcoin’s short-term outlook looks bullish, one analyst has warned of a massive correction once the rally peaks. Some even call it a “mathematical certainty” that Bitcoin could tumble to as low as $2,000–$3,000 in the future. The long-term provisional target remains at $140,000. According to technical wave counts, Bitcoin could break its all-time high soon, fueling further gains. However, it’s crucial for traders to follow the correct wave structure, as many misinterpret ongoing movements. Post $140K, while some might expect an immediate peak, analysts suggest there’s still more room for growth before Bitcoin enters a major correction phase. Ultimately, though, Bitcoin is expected to undergo a supercycle correction back down to $3,000–$2,000 once the top is in — a cycle seen repeatedly in its history. Macro Risks and Market Warnings Adding to the uncertainty, the U.S. Dollar Index is weakening and could slide further, which often helps risk assets like Bitcoin. However, broader economic issues — like the recent U.S. credit downgrade and rising bond yields — might create new challenges for crypto markets. There’s also speculation that the Federal Reserve may step in with emergency liquidity measures if financial markets get shaky again, adding more volatility to Bitcoin’s path. Markets To Be Less Volatile This Time? Bitcoin still moves closely with risky assets like stocks, so it will take time before it truly moves on its own. This cycle, the leverage in Bitcoin is low compared to the 2021 peak, which could mean less wild price swings. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe says Bitcoin is heading to new all-time highs faster than expected. He sees $120K, $150K, and even $200K as imminent as more and more people are frustrated with the dollar’s ongoing devaluation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-hits-108k-just-2-from-ath-but-could-it-really-crash-to-2000/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T11:35:13.000Z,"Bitcoin Maxis Trying To Stop What’s Coming for Ripple and XRP: Pundit","The feud between Bitcoin maximalists and XRP supporters has erupted into a full-blown ideological clash, driven by Ripple’s bold foray into the stablecoin market and an eyebrow-raising political slight. At the center of this intensifying drama is the recent cancellation of a scheduled meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and a U.S. senator —a move many in the crypto space view as a deliberate attempt to stifle Ripple’s growing influence. This incident, amplified by viral commentary from crypto analyst The Real Remi Relief on X, has been interpreted as a coordinated attempt by Bitcoin Maxis to block what’s coming for Ripple and XRP. As Ripple charts a new course with game-changing acquisitions and stablecoin initiatives, the tension between camps has reached a boiling point, revealing a high-stakes battle for control over the future of digital finance. Political Snub Fuels Tensions Between Ripple and Bitcoin Maxis According to reports from TimesTabloid , Brad Garlinghouse had been slated to meet with U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis to discuss Ripple’s regulatory roadmap and its role in the evolving crypto landscape. However, the meeting was canceled at the last minute, without any attempt to reschedule. The decision triggered outrage within the XRP community , with many interpreting the move as politically motivated. According to The Real Remi Relief, the incident was more than just a scheduling conflict—it was a coordinated effort by Bitcoin maximalists to suppress Ripple’s growing political capital. “The BTC Maxis are trying to stop what’s coming for Ripple & XRP,” he posted on X, asserting that the senator’s actions were influenced by forces who feel threatened by Ripple’s accelerating momentum. The BTC Maxis are trying to stop what’s coming for Ripple & XRP… This is what’s happening behind closed doors… 1) Ripple is buying Circle USDC 2) USAGov will be using RLUSD & USDC 3) BTC maxis are trying to stall/stop the genius act because once that happens XRP will be… pic.twitter.com/Fn05PRNxAk — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 19, 2025 Ripple’s Attempted Acquisition of Circle Adding fuel to the fire, Ripple has been making aggressive moves behind the scenes to bolster its stablecoin position. Timestabloid recently reported that Ripple had made a multi-billion-dollar acquisition offer to Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Initial reports indicated an offer in the $4 billion to $5 billion range, which Circle rejected, deeming it far below its valuation, especially ahead of its anticipated IPO. Undeterred, Ripple reportedly increased its bid to a staggering $20 billion, highlighting the company’s ambition to not only lead in cross-border payments but also dominate the stablecoin market. This level of investment shows Ripple’s intent to become a central pillar in the future of global digital finance—an outcome that Bitcoin Maxis are reportedly desperate to stop. Potential Adoption of Stablecoins Even as negotiations with Circle continued, Ripple had already laid the groundwork for its stablecoin, RLUSD , which launched in December 2024. Backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash reserves, RLUSD is a fully-regulated, USD-pegged stablecoin designed for real-world utility and interoperability. The token operates natively on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, and it’s engineered for enterprise-grade liquidity, on-chain payments, and tokenization. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s strategy is clear: establish a regulatory-compliant, technologically robust stablecoin that can rival USDC and pave the way for adoption by government and financial institutions. With talk of the U.S. government exploring RLUSD and USDC for official digital payment channels, Ripple appears to be positioning itself at the heart of a new digital financial order. A Threat to the Crypto Status Quo For Bitcoin maximalists, these moves represent more than just business competition—they threaten the very foundations of their belief system. Maxis advocate for Bitcoin as the only legitimate digital asset, and they often deride other projects as centralized or inferior. Ripple, with its deep institutional ties and regulatory outreach, has long been a target of such criticism. But now, with real political traction and a potentially dominant position in stablecoins, Ripple poses an existential threat to Bitcoin’s supremacy. The canceled Senate meeting has thus become a flashpoint in this ideological war. To XRP supporters, it represents an act of obstruction by those threatened by Ripple’s progress. To others, it’s a sign that the corridors of power are not yet ready to embrace the transformative shift Ripple is advocating. Either way, the friction is undeniable. The Inevitable Shift: XRP’s Path to the Top Despite the resistance, momentum appears to be on Ripple’s side. With RLUSD live , major acquisition bids in play, and whispers of U.S. government alignment, XRP’s ascent seems not only possible but increasingly probable. As The Real Remi Relief put it, “Nobody can stop what’s coming.” Whether Ripple ultimately overtakes Ethereum or even challenges Bitcoin remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the crypto landscape is evolving fast, and Ripple is at the helm of that transformation. If XRP does rise to the top, it will be because of strategic foresight, regulatory persistence, and its ability to build in the face of opposition, not despite the obstacles, but because of them.

Atkins, testifying in one of his first public hearings since taking office, reaffirmed his commitment to prioritizing digital asset oversight, while Adams announced the formation of a Digital Advisory Council to attract investment and make New York the world’s leading crypto hub. New York City Aims to Become Global Crypto Capital with New Digital Advisory Council New York City Mayor Eric Adams is pushing forward with his long-standing digital asset agenda, announcing on Monday the formation of a new Digital Advisory Council aimed at establishing the city as the “crypto capital of the globe.” Speaking at the inaugural New York City Crypto Summit on May 20, Adams emphasized the importance of integrating blockchain technology into civic life, not as a passing trend, but as a foundational shift for New York’s digital future. While specific details remain under wraps, Adams said the council would be composed of local experts and fintech leaders, with a council chair and formal policy recommendations expected in the coming weeks. Mayor Adams made it clear that this initiative is about more than branding. He envisions blockchain technology playing a direct role in city governance and public services. One of the proposals under consideration is enabling New Yorkers to pay for certain municipal services and taxes using cryptocurrencies, a move that would align the city with broader state-level legislative efforts already underway. Adams also floated the idea of using blockchain to safeguard sensitive documentation, such as birth and death certificates, in a secure yet accessible format. This latest push follows a May 12 announcement that financial services company Figure and private equity firms Traction and Scale would assist in the city’s broader blockchain adoption efforts. These firms bring fintech, tokenization, and asset management experience to the table, suggesting the advisory council may focus on more than just payments and records. It may also evaluate tokenized infrastructure, digital identity, and blockchain-based capital formation strategies. The mayor’s commitment to crypto and Web3 initiatives isn’t new. Since taking office in January 2022, Adams has consistently promoted the city’s adoption of digital assets—famously opting to receive his first three paychecks in Bitcoin as a gesture of support. State-Level Momentum but Limited Progress While Adams takes the initiative on the city level, several New York State legislators have also attempted to advance digital asset policy statewide. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill allowing state agencies to accept crypto payments. Earlier, in February, State Senator James Sanders Jr. proposed the Blockchain Study Act, aimed at forming a task force to assess the state’s blockchain landscape. However, both bills remain in legislative limbo and have yet to advance through either the state Senate or Assembly. These developments come amid a broader trend of US states positioning themselves for the crypto economy. At least 18 states are considering proposals to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, and New Hampshire and Arizona have already passed related legislation, according to data from Bitcoin Reserve Monitor. States pushing for Bitcoin reserves (Source: Bitcoin Reserve Monitor ) Mayor Adams' commitment to crypto faced scrutiny after he was indicted on corruption charges tied to alleged illegal campaign contributions from the Turkish government. However, in a surprising turn of events, the US Justice Department directed local authorities to drop the charges, and the case was formally dismissed with prejudice on April 2. Despite the controversy, Adams has used the clearing of his name as a springboard to reassert his policy platform, which he says is centered on economic inclusion, technological equity, and digital transformation. Crypto Summit Marks Turning Point The New York City Crypto Summit, where Adams made his announcement, marks the city’s most formal step toward integrating the crypto industry into its public and economic systems. The summit included representatives from fintech startups, blockchain developers, venture capital firms, and policymakers, signaling a concerted effort to position the city competitively against other global crypto hubs like Dubai, Singapore, and London. With new collaborations, a policy council in motion, and continued legislative efforts at the state level, New York City is setting the stage to reclaim its tech dominance. The crypto industry, long skeptical of New York’s historically strict regulations, may find renewed optimism in Adams’ approach, which blends regulatory realism with a pro-innovation stance. The next steps include finalizing the Digital Advisory Council’s structure and releasing policy recommendations—expected before the end of Q2 2025. In parallel, pilot programs for blockchain-based document security and crypto tax payment systems are reportedly under internal review. Whether these plans will translate into meaningful infrastructure, and actual adoption, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: New York is back in the conversation, and this time, it’s speaking the language of tokenization. New SEC Chair Paul Atkins Pledges Crypto Reform as GENIUS Act Gains Momentum In related news, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins appeared before lawmakers on May 20 in a highly anticipated congressional oversight hearing, making his position clear: the future of digital asset regulation will be one of his top priorities. Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee, Atkins addressed a slew of questions ranging from regulatory funding transparency to interagency collaboration. While measured in tone, his remarks confirmed that the SEC is preparing to pivot away from the enforcement-heavy stance of past leadership and toward a more structured, collaborative framework for regulating cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Paul Atkins at a May 20 SEC oversight hearing (Source: House Appropriations Committee ) A New Tone at the Top Atkins’ appointment in April, under the nomination of President Donald Trump, was widely seen as a turning point for US digital asset regulation. A former SEC commissioner himself, Atkins brings both institutional credibility and industry-friendly leanings to the role. His early actions have signaled an effort to realign the SEC’s approach to crypto with market realities and innovation imperatives. This hearing marked his first major public appearance since assuming the role and came just a day after the US Senate moved forward on a vote to consider the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act)—a landmark piece of legislation that could redefine stablecoin oversight. Lawmakers pressed Atkins on the status of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, helmed by Commissioner Hester Peirce, and sought specifics on its budget, timeline, and objectives. Representative Chuck Edwards (R-NC) asked directly how much funding had been allocated to the task force, a question Atkins declined to answer directly, saying only that the findings were “still under development.” Though vague on numbers, Atkins confirmed the task force’s first formal report is expected within the coming months. This report, he hinted, will lay the groundwork for clearer guidance on token classification, disclosures, custody frameworks, and potentially even DeFi-specific protocols. Upcoming June Roundtable Signals DeFi Focus The SEC is also organizing a series of roundtable discussions with commissioners and private sector leaders, the next of which is scheduled for June 9 and will focus specifically on decentralized finance (DeFi). These forums are expected to influence the Commission’s internal rulemaking discussions and could set the stage for tailored regulation that distinguishes DeFi from centralized crypto platforms. Sources close to the SEC suggest that these roundtables are part of a broader strategy to rehabilitate the agency’s relationship with the digital asset sector, which has long criticized the SEC for pursuing regulation through enforcement rather than engagement. Atkins' remarks coincided with major movement in the US Senate on the GENIUS Act, which aims to create a national framework for stablecoin issuance, reserve audits, and regulatory jurisdiction. Under the act, stablecoin oversight would be clarified and shared between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), with the Federal Reserve overseeing reserve asset integrity. The bill is part of a wave of crypto-related legislation currently under discussion in Congress, including proposals for tax deferrals on digital asset transactions, definitions for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and digital identity protection using blockchain technology. Atkins signaled alignment with the GENIUS Act's objectives, suggesting the SEC would welcome legislative clarity that delineates its role in overseeing specific digital asset classes, particularly stablecoins and security tokens. From SEC Limbo to Regulatory Momentum Atkins’ prior statements have been critical of the regulatory vacuum that the crypto market has found itself in under past administrations. Now, with increasing alignment between legislative efforts and SEC reform, the prospect of a more stable and transparent regulatory framework for US crypto markets is closer than ever. Industry groups including the Blockchain Association, Coin Center, and Crypto Council for Innovation have cautiously welcomed Atkins' leadership, noting his willingness to engage constructively with both innovators and lawmakers.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9210/sec-and-nyc-signal-strategic-embrace-of-blockchain-technology,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T11:27:20.000Z,"Bears Keep Litecoin and Quant Prices Under $100—Will They Spark a Breakout in May?","The post Bears Keep Litecoin and Quant Prices Under $100—Will They Spark a Breakout in May? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price surged above $107,000 for the second time in the past few days, which has raised confidence, making users optimistic. Interestingly, the Bitcoin dominance experienced a small pullback, which suggests a shift in the investor’s attention away from the star token towards the other altcoins. Meanwhile, the popular ones are failing to rise above their respective resistance as Ethereum remains stuck below $2600 and the prices of Litecoin & Quant continue to accumulate below $100. Now the question arises whether an ETH price breakout is required to lift the LTC & QNT price above $100 or a major price action is fast approaching. Litecoin (LTC) Price Feared for Another Drop The Litecoin price had broken above the prolonged consolidated range in the first few weeks, but the momentum faded as the token reached the end of Q1. Although the bulls are working hard to validate a V-shaped recovery, the bears are successfully dragging the levels below $100 and have kept the price restricted within the range. The current chart pattern could appear bullish, but in the wider timeframe, the LTC price appears to be primed for a major pullback. The LTC price has remained stuck within a rising parallel channel for over a few years, after triggering a rebound from the 2022 bear market. The token has been trying to breach above the average band of the channel for over a couple of weeks, but the bearish start for the week flashes bearish signals. The 50/200-day MA is failing to initiate a Golden cross while the DMI is heading towards a bearish crossover. Therefore, the Litecoin price is feared to drop back close to $75 if the token fails to trigger a rebound. Quant (QNT) Price in a Decisive Phase Quant has maintained a horizontal consolidation after surging by over 60%. The consolidation has been flashing the weakness of the bulls, which may point towards an extended pullback. The QNT price is trading within a decisive phase, and hence, a breakout could elevate the price beyond current highs. While the volume remains within a restrictive range, it would be interesting to watch whether the price will rise to $111 or drop close to $80. As seen in the above chart, the Quant price is about to experience a rise in volatility as the Bollinger bands are about to contract. On the other hand, the Chaikin Money Flow is heading towards the average range, hinting towards a drop in the money flow. This suggests the token is likely to accumulate for some more time, followed by which a major price action could follow, depending on the volume induced. Considering the current price action, breaching above $100 seems to be quite difficult for the prices of Litecoin and Quant. However, with a rise in the buying volume, the market sentiments could change, which could clear the barriers to rise above the 3-digit figure.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bears-keep-litecoin-and-quant-prices-under-100-will-they-spark-a-breakout-in-may/,"BTC|LTC|MARKET|TRADING|QNT","Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Russia's Justice Ministry has prepared a draft law that would classify Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as property subject to seizure, local news agency Tass reported. This bill facilitates the seizure and subsequent confiscation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and classifies them as property. The draft law was first introduced by Russian Deputy Justice Minister Vadim Fedorov, who attended the St. Petersburg International Law Forum (SPILF). Fedorov explained that this bill will determine the necessary procedures and considerations to facilitate and accelerate the confiscation of BTC and cryptocurrencies. “The Department of Justice has prepared a bill that would classify digital currencies as property for purposes of seizure and subsequent forfeiture. This bill will speed up the seizure and confiscation of digital assets. Because digital assets cannot be physically seized and placed in a safe, as is the case with cash and valuables.

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case. In August 2024, NFT trading platform OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC, alleging that NFTs traded on the marketplace could qualify as unregistered securities. On Feb. 22, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the SEC has officially closed its investigation into the platform. The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries. The lawyers urged the SEC to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws.”Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-royalties-not-securities-sec-peirce?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations. Source: FSCRelated: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFsExchange sales to be restrictedCrypto exchanges will be allowed to liquidate user fees paid in crypto, but only to cover operational costs. Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors.Cointelegraph contacted South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cardsSouth Korean candidates push pro-crypto agendaSouth Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, aiming to curb capital flight and bolster the country’s financial autonomy.Speaking at a recent policy forum, Lee said a won-based stablecoin could help retain domestic wealth and reduce dependence on foreign-backed digital currencies such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC).The initiative is part of Lee’s broader push for digital asset reforms, which also includes legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party, has also expressed support for introducing spot crypto ETFs, signaling bipartisan momentum on the issue.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-tightens-kyc-rules-ahead-of-institutional-crypto-entry?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC. There is little doubt that institutional buying remains the primary catalyst for Bitcoin to break above the $108,000 level. Such a move would trigger the liquidation of heavily leveraged bearish positions, likely accelerating the push to a new all-time high. However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation.

They added that Fusion integrates economic alignment, network design and composability to achieve real-world outcomes.  Fusion expects traction in composer and module developmentThe Fusion team expects composers and modules — the two building blocks for the protocol — to gain traction in the next two to three years. The spokesperson told Cointelegraph that they are starting with five composers and nearly 100 modules in the first year. The team expects this to more than double over the next two to three years.“Because of how the ecosystem is designed, in two to three years we expect that the Fusion ecosystem will consist of tens of composers and hundreds of modules,” the spokesperson said. Fusion’s architecture is designed to let enterprises and Web3 builders combine technology, financial tools, and identity features in ways that were previously unavailable, the spokesperson added.“Fusion is an initiative led and funded by the Avalanche community that is only technologically possible on Avalanche,” the spokesperson said, claiming that the initiative strengthens Avalanche’s position as a blockchain that delivers real-world business value. Related: Indonesia’s DigiAsia shares pop 90% on plan to raise $100M to buy Bitcoin$100 million fund to come from existing Avalanche programsThe project is funded by resources allocated in existing Avalanche programs.

2025-05-20T12:18:57.000Z,"India’s Supreme Court urges government to regulate cryptocurrency","India’s Supreme Court has questioned the government’s lack of regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies despite imposing taxes on digital assets like Bitcoin.According to Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the growing use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies while remaining largely unregulated.“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins and is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.Kant further highlighted that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.“If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said.Related: Indian high court orders steps to block Proton MailGovernment says review may followThe Additional Solicitor General of India — a senior legal officer representing the government of India — reportedly answered the request by saying that the government “will take instructions, my lord,” indicating that the government may consider reviewing the country’s current cryptocurrency regulation.The report follows a May 5 hearing by the Supreme Court of India during which Kant and lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani shared their views on cryptocurrency. Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.”India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators.

The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction.“Namely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,“ the Maelstrom announcement states.A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen’s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach:“We believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.“Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure — zkSNACKs CEOPayjoin: Soon in wallets near you?Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets.

Maelstrom’s chief investment officer and BitMEX crypto exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes said that “improving financial privacy in Bitcoin is extremely important.” He added:“The great thing about Payjoin is that if only a small amount of adoption is achieved, it breaks a key assumption used by financial surveillance companies. The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.“A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm “is keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.” The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects.Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin?Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or notHayes noted that “Payjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don’t use it.” Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily.Allen told Cointelegraph he is “building out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.” He explained that encouraging its adoption “is the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.” The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that “a key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.” “In particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,” they added.Magazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-payjoin-privacy-grant-maelstrom?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T03:08:27.000Z,"SEC’s Crenshaw says agency playing ‘regulatory Jenga’ with crypto","The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s sole Democratic Commissioner has said the agency is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga” with its approach to the crypto industry and market regulation under the Trump administration. In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.”Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.”Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-crenshaw-agency-playing-regulatory-jenga-with-crypto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
