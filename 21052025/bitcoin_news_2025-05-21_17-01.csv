2025-05-21T14:48:26.000Z,"Bitcoin Maxi: I Just Called My Bank, and They‚Äôve Never Heard of Ripple (XRP)","In what many have interpreted as a veiled mockery of XRP and its community, Bitcoin advocate Phil Geiger recently posted on X, ‚ÄúRipple has been marketing that banks are going to use XRP since 2013. I just called my bank, and they‚Äôve never heard of Ripple.‚Äù This remark, while seemingly innocuous on the surface, comes amid intensifying tensions between XRP enthusiasts and Bitcoin maximalists following the recent political saga involving Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis. The senator reportedly canceled a scheduled meeting with Garlinghouse without providing a new date‚Äîan act many in the XRP community perceived as a snub, triggering a new wave of tribalism in the already fragmented crypto space. Ripple has been marketing that banks are going to use XRP since 2013. I just called my bank, and they've never heard of Ripple. ‚Äî Phil Geiger (@phil_geiger) May 20, 2025 XRP vs. Bitcoin Maximalism: A Reignited Feud The timing of Geiger‚Äôs jab is no coincidence. The crypto community has been embroiled in a fiery discourse ever since Timestabloid reported that Senator Lummis, a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, abruptly pulled out of a scheduled discussion with Ripple‚Äôs CEO. No explanation or rescheduling was provided, a move XRP supporters viewed as politically motivated and dismissive of Ripple‚Äôs contributions to crypto innovation and policy discourse. The incident fueled the long-standing feud between Bitcoin maximalists, who argue for Bitcoin‚Äôs supremacy and the irrelevance of altcoins, and XRP enthusiasts, who see Ripple‚Äôs technology as essential to the future of global finance. Phil Geiger‚Äôs sarcastic post echoes a popular maximalist narrative: that Ripple‚Äôs decade-long marketing claims about XRP being adopted by banks have not materialized meaningfully. The tone of his post suggests that despite Ripple‚Äôs years of promotion and partnership announcements, its impact remains largely theoretical to the average consumer, and, according to Geiger, to mainstream banks as well. Ripple‚Äôs Track Record with Financial Institutions Since 2013, Ripple has maintained that its blockchain-based payment solutions, including its native token XRP, would revolutionize cross-border banking by offering faster and cheaper alternatives to SWIFT. Over the years, the company has secured partnerships with several financial institutions and central banks for pilot projects and integrations. Yet, many of these initiatives rely on RippleNet or On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) rather than the XRP token itself. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Critics argue that the distinction between Ripple‚Äôs software products and XRP is often blurred in marketing campaigns, leading to confusion about XRP‚Äôs actual utility. Geiger‚Äôs statement, while dismissive, taps into this skepticism by implying that if banks aren‚Äôt even aware of Ripple, then XRP‚Äôs touted future as a banking staple may be overblown. A Clash of Ideologies The XRP vs. Bitcoin feud is more than a battle over market share; it reflects a philosophical divide. Bitcoin maximalists like Geiger prioritize decentralization, censorship resistance, and trustless systems‚Äîtraits they argue XRP lacks due to Ripple‚Äôs centralized control. Meanwhile, XRP advocates counter that practical adoption and institutional integration matter more than ideological purity , especially in the context of remittances and international finance. The canceled meeting between Senator Lummis and Ripple‚Äôs CEO added fuel to this ideological fire. Lummis‚Äôs close alignment with Bitcoin interests has led many to question whether there is an institutional bias against other projects in the regulatory arena. In this context, Geiger‚Äôs post can be seen not merely as personal skepticism but as a calculated attempt to diminish XRP‚Äôs standing at a politically sensitive moment. Phil Geiger‚Äôs post is emblematic of the renewed antagonism between Bitcoin maximalists and XRP supporters ‚Äîa tension inflamed by political snubs, regulatory battles, and divergent visions for crypto‚Äôs future. Whether XRP ultimately achieves the banking adoption that Ripple has long promised remains uncertain. But what is clear is that, in the ongoing war of crypto ideologies, even a phone call to a local bank can be wielded as a weapon.

2025-05-21T14:36:14.000Z,"Metaplanet Faces Major Short Squeeze as Bitcoin Bet Defies Bears","A brewing financial drama is capturing global attention as Metaplanet Inc., Asia‚Äôs leading Bitcoin treasury company, has become Japan‚Äôs most shorted stock. Data shared on X by company CEO Simon Gerovich shows more than 25% of Metaplanet‚Äôs shares have been borrowed for short positions, setting the stage for what some crypto community members feel could be a potential GameStop-style short squeeze, but this time powered by Bitcoin. BTC Strategy Powers Record Growth Metaplanet‚Äôs speedy rise from a hospitality company into Japan‚Äôs biggest corporate BTC holder has made it both a darling of the Bitcoin maximalist crowd and a target of institutional skepticism. On May 18, the firm reported a record ¬•877 million ($6M) in Q1 revenue, with a whopping 88% attributed to its Bitcoin strategy. It has also increased its holdings of the crypto asset by almost four times since January, with its latest buy of 1,004 BTC for over $104 million bringing its entire stash to 7,800 BTC valued at more than $800 million. That same day, Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy also announced a 7,390 BTC purchase , pushing its holdings to 576,230 BTC. Still, instead of boosting investor confidence across the board, the Tokyo-listed company‚Äôs crypto pivot prompted an intense wave of short interest.¬†Japanese bond yields, like the 30-year JGB spiking to 3.14% on May 20, seem to have sparked bearish bets on risk-on assets, including crypto-heavy stocks like Metaplanet‚Äôs. Over the past seven days, the firm‚Äôs shares dipped 12.84%, suggesting early success for short sellers. However, they seem to have underestimated retail and institutional momentum, and the trend may be quickly reversing. Short Squeeze Risk Escalates In two consecutive days, Metaplanet‚Äôs share price rocketed to its daily limit-up and was halted on both days, closing at ¬•933 on May 21. The halts, triggered by Tokyo Stock Exchange circuit breakers, have prevented short sellers from exiting their positions, potentially setting up a slow-motion squeeze. Bitcoiners are now rallying behind Metaplanet, likening it to the 2021 GameStop frenzy, but with one crucial difference: Metaplanet is backed by Bitcoin, not meme stock hype. ‚ÄúMetaplanet MTPLF will be the GME of 2021,‚Äù tweeted analyst Chicken Genius. ‚ÄúExcept this time, backed by the hardest monetary hedge in the world. Bitcoin.‚Äù On May 20, CEO Gerovich shared that his firm‚Äôs OTC listing had seen an uptick in ranking, jumping to third by dollar volume and fourth by trade counts across more than 12,000 companies. What makes the current play even more potent is Metaplanet‚Äôs strategy. As a community member, Macrocomics noted , the business leverages a put-selling strategy on Bitcoin futures to either acquire BTC at a discount or generate income for more purchases, thereby improving its Bitcoin yield without taking on debt. So, while short sellers may view the organization as overextended, its fundamentals and market sentiment tell a different story. ‚ÄúImagine being short Metaplanet on the TSE and being unable to close your short positions the past 2 days because of limit up halts,‚Äù warned an X user. With the firm‚Äôs stock locked in limit-up territory, traders are bracing for another spike when trading resumes. And if retail investors join the rally, as they did with GameStop, the squeeze could intensify, forcing short sellers to cover at even higher prices.

2025-05-21T14:34:38.000Z,"Monero and Zcash soar up to 70% amid demand for privacy-focused cryptos","Cryptocurrencies have rallied following the recent trade agreement between the United States and China . While Bitcoin teases a breakout to fresh ATH, hovering at $106,590, privacy-focused coins Monero and Zcash display lucrative performance, up 68% and 30%, respectively, on their monthly price charts. The rally has grabbed the attention of institutional and retail investors, especially as XMR and ZEC outperformed top assets like Bitcoin and the US dollar. Meanwhile, Bitfinex identified the catalyst driving privacy digital tokens: the renewed interest in anonymity within the crypto sector.

Privacy prioritized amid regulatory chatter Monero and Zcash‚Äôs comeback coincides with rising worries about centralized data gathering, government outreach, and digital surveillance. With nations introducing stiffer AML and KYC policies, crypto enthusiasts are migrating to projects that promise transactional privacy. Bitfinex explained : ‚ÄúAs central banks and regulators move toward frameworks such as CBDCs, real-time transaction monitoring, and stricter KYC/AML policies, users seek tools that preserve financial anonymity. Privacy coins offer a technological counterweight to these trends by enabling peer-to-peer value transfer without exposing transaction histories or wallet balances.‚Äù Monero and Zcash appear to be the perfect solutions on that front. XMR‚Äôs blockchain uses stealth addresses and ring signatures to ensure anonymous transactions. Meanwhile, Zcash‚Äôs zero-knowledge proofs allow individuals to choose between shielded and transparent transfers. Therefore, the duo‚Äôs comeback reflects sentiment shifts, with most users prioritizing privacy. XMR and ZEC price actions Top privacy cryptocurrencies displayed substantial gains as their market cap increased by 3% in the past 24 hours to $45.81 billion. Also, their daily trading volume soared 20% to $5.49 billion (CoinMarketCap data), indicating renewed interest in the asset class. XMR trades at $362 after gaining 4.06% and 6% in the past day and week. It has remained elevated in the past few sessions amidst upbeat sentiments in privacy cryptocurrencies. Zcash joined the upside, gaining 3% the previous day to hover at $41.41. The altcoins reflect significant gains on their monthly timeframes, hinting at extended uptrends in the near term.

2025-05-21T14:34:22.000Z,"Arthur Hayes Warns of Harsh Bitcoin Correction, Reveals Portfolio Strategy","The post Arthur Hayes Warns of Harsh Bitcoin Correction, Reveals Portfolio Strategy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is back with a sharp take on the crypto market, revealing his portfolio and laying out bold predictions for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins in a new interview. Speaking on the Bankless YouTube channel , Hayes gave a full rundown of his family office Maelstrom Fund‚Äôs strategy and warned of some turbulence ahead ‚Äì even as he remains confident in a strong bull run. Inside Maelstrom Fund: Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead the Way Hayes said that the Maelstrom Fund is largely anchored by the two biggest cryptocurrencies. ‚ÄúMaelstrom [Fund] is about like 60% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum. And then a lot of other shitcoins, term sheets of token deals and stuff,‚Äù he said. As for his non-crypto assets, Hayes is holding physical gold, gold mining stocks, and treasury bills. He sees this mix as a way to balance high-risk opportunities in crypto with more traditional, stable investments. Bitcoin‚Äôs Big Run: $250,000 by Year-End? With Bitcoin trading at $106,480 ( may differ ), Hayes is bullish, predicting a surge to $150,000‚Äì$200,000 by summer 2025, a potential 90% jump. But brace for impact: he expects a ‚Äúnasty correction‚Äù before Bitcoin rockets to $250,000 by the end of 2025. His confidence stems from market cycles and macroeconomic trends, though he didn‚Äôt shy away from the volatility ahead. Ethereum‚Äôs Uphill Battle and Altcoin Wildcard Ethereum, now at $2,528 ( may vary ), faces a tougher road. Hayes pegs $5,000 as a key milestone by year-end, potentially reigniting hype that could push ETH to $10,000 or even $20,000 at the cycle‚Äôs peak. Hayes expects a vibrant season for altcoins driven by fresh narratives and decentralized exchange gems, but warns against overhyped, high-FDV tokens with no traction. Only the innovative will shine. Bitcoin as a Reserve Currency? Hayes Explains Arthur Hayes sees Bitcoin as a global reserve currency if the U.S. dollar‚Äôs credibility fades due to ‚Äò reckless ‚Äò treasury spending. Its ‚Äò decentralized ‚Äò, fixed-supply nature positions it as a digital alternative to gold, hedging against fiat collapse. A Market to Watch Hayes‚Äô analytics and Maelstrom‚Äôs actions signal a dynamic crypto transformation. Will his predictions hold?

2025-05-21T14:30:53.000Z,"JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo All Downgraded by Moody‚Äôs Following US Government Loss of AAA Rating: Report","Moody‚Äôs has downgraded deposit ratings of top US lenders JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo just days after stripping the nation of its triple-A rating. In a new report by Bloomberg, the lenders‚Äô long-term deposit ratings were lowered to Aa2, a one-step decrease and Moody‚Äôs third-highest level. The reason cited by Moody‚Äôs for the downgrade is the government‚Äôs weakened ability to support the banks. On Friday, Moody‚Äôs downgraded America‚Äôs credit rating from AAA to AA1 while changing the country‚Äôs outlook from negative to stable. Moody‚Äôs attributes the downgrade to the United States‚Äô soaring national debt and interest payment ratios that exceed those of other countries with the same credit rating. ‚ÄúAs deficits and debt have grown, and interest rates have risen, interest payments on government debt have increased markedly. Without adjustments to taxation and spending, we expect budget flexibility to remain limited, with mandatory spending, including interest expense, projected to rise to around 78% of total spending by 2035 from about 73% in 2024.‚Äù Other bank rating downgrades included the senior unsecured debt ratings for some rated subsidiaries and branches of Bank of America.

2025-05-21T14:30:04.000Z,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong ‚Äì Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year","Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades ‚Äì Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month‚Äôs retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high‚Äîand potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin‚Äôs struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset‚Äôs multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility ‚Äì High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we‚Äôll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape. Overview Cryptocurrency Celestia Token TIA Price $2.61(+0.13%) Market cap $1.68 Billion Trading volume (24-hour) $87.3 Million Circulating supply 639.85 Million TIA All-time high $20.91; Feb 10, 2024 All-time low $2.03; Oct 31, 2023 24-hour high $2.72 24-hour low $2.56 TIA price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $2.61 Price Prediction $8.48 (+230.23%) Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 9.33% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $2.72 200-Day SMA $4.07 14-Day RSI 47.26 TIA price analysis: TIA price faces a bearish pressure below $2.7 TIA price analysis shows bearish volatility below $2.7 Resistance for TIA is present at $2.997 Support for TIA/USD is present at $2.312 The TIA price analysis for May 21 confirms that TIA is witnessing bearish volatility below the $2.7 level.

TIA/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a surge above moving averages The 4-hour TIA price chart suggests TIA continues to experience intense volatility between $2.5 and $3, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Bears aim for a strong domination as the price prepares for a hold below EMA lines. TIA/USD 4-hour chart.

However, if the TIA price successfully breaks above $2.997, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $3.43. TIA/USDT Price Chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $2.312, resulting in a correction to $1.859. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‚Äòs performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia‚Äôs scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA‚Äôs price attempted to hold above $3.2 as the overall market sentiment turned bullish. However, buyers‚Äô failure triggered a bearish rally. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA‚Äôs price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers‚Äô interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Noble has introduced AppLayer, a new platform designed to help developers create financial tools and apps with fast, reliable stablecoin infrastructure on the Celestia network. Celestia price prediction May 2025 Celestia‚Äôs price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $100K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.8 and a maximum of $3.4, with an average of $2.5. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction May 2025 $1.8 $2.5 $3.4 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn‚Äôt felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $2.3, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Some of these investors might be waiting for the price surge triggered by the Bitcoin Halving to maximize their profits.

The TRUMP token debuted just days before the president's inauguration in January and was met with criticism from across the crypto industry and elsewhere.

Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, have argued that Trump‚Äôs crypto effort is eroding ethical norms. They‚Äôve introduced bills to block public officials from launching or endorsing digital assets.

Key technical signals point to strong bullish momentum. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on the verge of making history again as it approaches a new all-time high. After months of bearish structure defined by the 21 EMA, a major shift has taken place. A recent breakout above this level flipped market sentiment, creating a strong foundation for higher prices. With the price structure now showing clear signs of strength, a new ATH could be just around the corner, potentially within the week. Key technical points 21 EMA Flip: The 21 exponential moving average, which previously acted as resistance, is now confirmed support. Bullish Market Structure: Bitcoin has formed consistent higher highs and higher lows. Key Support Level: $102,790 is the critical support to maintain current bullish momentum. BTCUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Following the previous all-time high, Bitcoin entered a corrective phase, where price action was consistently rejected at the 21 EMA. This moving average defined the bearish structure, acting as dynamic resistance and leading to repeated pullbacks. However, once the swing low was established at $74,448, a significant surge in volume triggered a strong bullish reaction. This breakout was marked by bullish engulfing candles and a clear flip of the 21 EMA into support, a technical event that signaled the end of the bearish trend. Since then, Bitcoin has continued to respect the 21 EMA, bouncing off it to form new higher highs and higher lows, the textbook definition of a bullish market structure. The shift in momentum has also been supported by an uptick in trading volume and positive funding rates across major derivatives exchanges. These metrics reflect growing confidence among market participants, suggesting that institutional and retail investors alike are positioning for further upside as Bitcoin approaches price discovery territory.

What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin maintains support at $102,790, a breakout to new all-time highs could occur as early as this week.

According to the report, an American tourist who was partying at a nightclub in London booked an Uber to return home but got into the car of a fake Uber driver instead of the one shown on the Uber app. Afterwards, the American tourist claimed that the fake Uber driver gave him a cigarette after getting into the car, that the cigarette contained drugs, that he was drugged and kidnapped with the cigarette, and that he stole BTC and XRP from his account. According to Turist, the fake Uber driver stole $72,000 worth of XRP and $50,000 worth of Bitcoin from his crypto account. The incident was reported to the police, but no one has been caught yet. This incident serves as a reminder to everyone to keep their cryptocurrencies safe, as crypto crimes are on the rise worldwide. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-21T14:00:59.000Z,"JPMorgan Will Actively Manage a Bitcoin Fund for Customers, Outsourcing Custody to NYDIG","JPMorgan Chase, the world‚Äôs largest bank in terms of market cap, announced that it will now let customers buy Bitcoin. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, said he did not like Bitcoin but understood that customers deserve the right to choose which assets they invest in. The remarks by Dimon come at a JPMorgan investor day event, which aims to promote the bank and champion its progress. JPMorgan has a market cap of $740 billion, making it the largest bank in the world. JPMorgan manages over $4 trillion in assets, adding to its reputation and pride when dealing with investment preferences. Dimon has a history of disparaging Bitcoin, calling it a fraud , and during a Senate hearing with Elizabeth Warren, saying that he would close it down if he were in charge . Such statements, however, could not stop the tide of history, with many investors demanding that JPMorgan let them buy Bitcoin. Despite its CEO disparaging Bitcoin, JPMorgan will release a managed fund for Bitcoin investors. JPMorgan will actively manage the fund, but will not maintain custody of a Bitcoin wallet. The mega bank seems to be the least likely institution to embrace Bitcoin, given the comments made by its CEO. The new Bitcoin fund will be released this summer. The custody of cryptocurrencies will be outsourced to NYDIG, a crypto company. JPMorgan will actively manage the Bitcoin fund, a new development because many fund managers like Pantera Capital allow clients to invest in Bitcoin without handling it themselves. Dimon has been very vocal about his criticism of Bitcoin, even going so far as to say that he would fire any JPMorgan employee who traded the digital asset. He said that the act of trading Bitcoin was ‚Äústupid‚Äù and noted that Bitcoin has no ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù, which most likely refers to the fact that Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt have cash flows. However, Bitcoin is an unprecedented financial innovation. Dimon also said that criminals use Bitcoin. However, fiat currency is still the preferred medium for crime. JPMorgan, meanwhile, is investing in blockchain technology, executing its first transaction on a public blockchain last week. Dimon, meanwhile, is more concerned about the economy. He says that the risk of stagflation is most likely two times the amount factored in by the market. Dimon believes that stagflation will cause many problems for banks and companies. Dimon has both positive and negative things to say about Trump‚Äôs administration. He praises regulatory efforts and states that there is a clear motive to fix problems in that area. But he also points out that JPMorgan has lost a lot of business due to Trump‚Äôs tariff war. Dimon seems to flip-flop on his attitude towards Bitcoin. The JPMorgan CEO said he thinks blockchain is overrated and less important than people think. This recent statement during his speech this week contrasts with his previous comments about blockchain, where he has treated blockchain innovation separately from Bitcoin and even supported practical blockchain projects. Regardless of Dimon‚Äôs remarks, JPMorgan ran its first transaction on a public blockchain last week and has its own blockchain-based JPM coin.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/jpmorgan-will-actively-manage-a-bitcoin-fund-for-customers-outsourcing-custody-to-nydig/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|JPMorgan",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‚Äòaddress poisoning‚Äô attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning. According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy‚Äôs crypto decisioning tools and ‚Äúleverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.‚Äù The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. ‚ÄúAddress poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,‚Äù said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa. Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and Webacy Crypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target‚Äôs real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker‚Äôs address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds. The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million. Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them? Web2 security in a Web3 world Trugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O‚ÄôConnor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they‚Äôve been ‚Äúapplying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.‚Äù The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added: ‚ÄúMost existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.‚Äú The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O‚ÄôConnor highlighted that what sets their system apart is ‚Äúits emphasis on context and pattern recognition.‚Äù Isogawa explained that ‚ÄúAI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.‚Äù Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacks The machine learning approach O‚ÄôConnor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output. In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction. O‚ÄôConnor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. ‚ÄúTo top it off, we‚Äôve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.‚Äú Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|BNB","",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T14:00:36.000Z,"Solana Price Prediction: ETF Delays Raise Red Flags ‚Äì Is a Drop Below $100 Coming?","The Solana price has risen by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, with the coin struggling to reclaim momentum after the SEC delayed making a decision yesterday on several SOL ETFs. At $167, SOL is now down by 6.5% in a week, but the alt remains up by 13% in a fortnight and by 20% in a month. And while yesterday‚Äôs news may come as a disappointment for some holders, for others it wasn‚Äôt surprising, with the SEC still having a final deadline in October for most of the ETFs. Given Solana‚Äôs stature as the second-biggest layer-one after Ethereum, it has every chance of witnessing ETF approvals later in the year, something which could send its long-term price prediction sky high. Solana Price Prediction: ETF Delays Raise Red Flags ‚Äì Is a Drop Below $100 Coming? It‚Äôs not the first time that the SEC has delayed making a decision on spot-based Solana ETFs, with the regulator doing the same back in March . This is why yesterday‚Äôs delay has not had a particularly negative impact on Solana‚Äôs price, which is actually more than 40% up where it was on March 11, when the SEC delayed decisions on the 21Shares, Canary and VanEck Solana ETFs. SEC just delayed ALL Solana ETF applications from Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, and Canary, citing market manipulation concerns. They're \""instituting proceedings\"" to review if the SOL ETFs meet Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) standards for investor protection. pic.twitter.com/IxGPjWfC0a ‚Äî NeomaVentures (@NeomaVentures) May 20, 2025 This time, the SEC has added the Bitwise Solana ETF to the above list of re-delays, following last week‚Äôs delay for the Grayscale SOL ETF . It‚Äôs entirely arguable that such delays are routine, given that the regulator dragged its feet for years on Bitcoin ETFs, before approving the first batch last year. As such, Solana holders needn‚Äôt be too concerned, with the coin‚Äôs chart today showing that the coin remains on an upwards curve. Its relative strength index (purple) has been climbing since early April, and given how long it was below 50, it still has time to remain in an elevated, bullish position. Source: TradingView Indeed, SOL‚Äôs 30-day average (orange) also points to ongoing gains, seeing as how it‚Äôs about to climb over the 20-day (blue) and form a golden cross. We could therefore see several more weeks of sustained rallies for the Solana price, despite the SEC delaying over ETFs. This is partly because the market as a whole is recovering in the face of an improved tariff situation, but also because Solana remains one of the strongest alts in the market in terms of fundamentals. It boasts a total value locked of $9.2 billion , making it the second-biggest layer-one network in the crypto ecosystem. The Solana price could therefore reach $200 in the next few weeks, before topping $300 by Q4. A New Solana-Based Token for Big Gains Solana has also been the home of several hugely successful meme tokens in the past year or so, yet there‚Äôs one new Solana-based token that will bring rock-solid fundamentals when it launches in the next month. This is Solaxy (SOLX) , which has the distinction of being Solana‚Äôs first layer-two network. SOLX has raised $38.5 million in its presale, which will now end in 26 days. We‚Äôre going interstellar! 38M Raised! pic.twitter.com/udfUBJ0GBC ‚Äî SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 20, 2025 This figure makes Solaxy‚Äôs sale one of the biggest of the past few years, while another sign of its popularity comes from its follower count on X , which now numbers over 75,000. This suggests that Solaxy has plenty of momentum behind it, with the platform promising to provide ultra-low transaction fees and ultra-fast confirmation times once it launches. It will enable traders to avoid the delays and congestion that can still affect Solana, even after recent upgrades. It will also provide instant bridging between itself and Solana, making for a seamless experience for traders and DeFi users alike. Holders of SOLX will also be able to stake the token for passive income, and given that you will need SOLX to pay for Solaxy‚Äôs transaction fees, demand for the token could be very high. You can still buy it as part of its presale at the Solaxy website , where it now costs $0.00173. As noted above, the sale will end in 26 days, at which point the token will list on exchanges, and potentially rally.

2025-05-21T13:55:23.000Z,"Bitcoin, XRP worth $123K stolen from US tourist in London fake Uber scam","A US tourist reportedly claimed that he was drugged, duped by a fake Uber, and lost over $123,000 in crypto (BTC, XRP and more) during a London layover. What happened to Jacob Irwin-Cline sounds like a Black Mirror meets Web3 episode. The 30-year-old ex-software dev from Portland built a small fortune investing in Bitcoin as a teenager. On a short layover in London before visiting his parents in Spain, he went out for drinks in The Roxy nightclub in Soho. He called an Uber around 1:30 AM on May 9 to return to his hostel. Outside, a driver flagged him down, knowing his name, and matched the photo shown in the app. So he got in, but the car didn‚Äôt match the app, which was supposed to be the first red flag. Fake Uber driver drains tourist‚Äôs crypto wallets As per a report, the driver offered him a cigarette. At first, Jacob said no, but relented, ‚ÄúSure, if you want to bond over a cigarette.‚Äù It is believed that the cigarette was laced with scopolamine, a drug so dangerous that even Vice once called it ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs scariest.‚Äù Jacob started fading in and out, and the driver asked for his phone ‚Äúfor directions.‚Äù He got confused and gave it along with the passcodes. He vaguely recalls the driver scrolling through apps. By the time he realized what was happening, it was already too late. The driver accessed his crypto apps, including Revolut and reportedly drained everything. He woke up in a random London suburb where a stranger called him a cab back to his hostel. He finally grabbed his laptop to find out that it had been remotely wiped. Jacob said, ‚ÄúThey took the majority of my wealth,‚Äù and believes there‚Äôs ‚Äúless than a 1% chance‚Äù of recovery. Authorities confirmed the attacker accessed his wallets through Revolut , using a forced login. Jacob‚Äôs losses included $72,000 in XRP, around $50,000 in Bitcoin, and a handful of smaller altcoin positions. Altogether, $123,000 vanished, his life savings, built from teenage Bitcoin investments, drained in minutes. London crypto heist The attack fits the definition of a ‚Äúwrench attack,‚Äù where no hacking is needed. Just physical coercion, social engineering, and in this case, a sedative. Jacob doesn‚Äôt believe he was targeted for his wealth. He thinks the thief got lucky. Jacob says he has a good idea where the stolen crypto ended up‚Äîbut without insurance, and with most of it in cold wallets, recovery is ‚Äúvirtually impossible.‚Äù He‚Äôs now working with the FBI‚Äôs Virtual Assets Unit. Jacob is an early crypto investor. ‚ÄúI was investing in crypto before anyone. I was really into it in high school before Bitcoin was $1,000,‚Äù he added. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $106,576 with a trading volume of $54 billion. BTC knocked off its all-time high (ATH) of above $109K on January 20, 2025. It holds a market cap of around $2.11 trillion. On the other hand, XRP price has seen its biggest rally after Ripple bagged a partial win in the legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Both $ETH and $SUI are analysed. $ETH breaks out of falling wedge Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $ETH displays the big surge out from the 5-month long descending trendline. Once the local high was made at $2,700, the price action started to form a descending wedge, which is a bullish pattern. Having just broken out of this wedge, the price is currently consolidating, and may just head down to confirm the top of the wedge again, and the very strong support at $2,500, before heading higher. $ETH ready to break upwards from critical $2,500 horizontal support Source: TradingView The weekly time frame gives more of a clear-cut view of the situation for $ETH. The $2,500 could be about to become that extremely strong support level that $ETH bulls can use as a base for the next surge higher. The last swing high at $4,100 is the target. Failure to get above this would mean a failed rally, therefore making $2,500 into critical support is an absolute must. $SUI about to break out of second successive bull flag Source: TradingView Since breaking beyond its own major descending trendline, the $SUI price is now in its second bull flag. A breakout of this current bull flag would likely provide the impetus to also break through the $4.10 horizontal resistance level. $SUI $4.10 resistance key to all-time high Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame, the significance of the $4.10 resistance can be really appreciated. A break through this level, and consolidation above, would leave the path open for the bulls to make an assault on the $5.36 all-time high.

According to a new report from local news publication MyLondon , Jacob Irwin-Cline from Portland, Oregon, was on a two-day layover when he requested an Uber after leaving The Roxy, a nightclub in Soho, around 1:30 AM on May 9. The 30-year-old former software developer and crypto investor said he was intercepted by a driver who appeared to match the profile displayed in the app and who called out the alias he had saved as his name in the Uber account. Having reportedly later asked the nightclub for CCTV footage of the incident, Irwin-Cline said it was a ‚Äúdark sedan‚Äù that pulled up, and not the Toyota Prius that was listed on his Uber app. ‚ÄúThe guy seemed super chill, super nice,‚Äù Irwin-Cline narrated. The techie said he accepted a cigarette from the driver and started feeling disoriented shortly afterwards. He believes the cigarette may have been laced with scopolamine, also known as ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Breath,‚Äù a powerful sedative known for causing blackouts while keeping victims conscious.

2025-05-21T13:44:39.000Z,"Trader Is Certain of 64,000% XRP Price Rally, Sets Likely Timeline","In a bold market projection that has captured the attention of the XRP community, popular crypto influencer The Real Remi Relief has made a stunning claim on X, asserting that XRP could surge by as much as 64,000% in the current bull cycle. According to Remi , this exponential growth could see the price of XRP skyrocket to $1,700 per coin between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. His analysis, deeply rooted in historical market behavior, particularly the 2017‚Äì2018 cycle, has sparked renewed interest and debate about the long-term potential of XRP as both a digital asset and a critical component of global financial infrastructure. Told everyone months ago‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre following the 2017-2108 breakout and to expect a 64,000% increase in XRP to a $1700 XRP Q4/Q1 Told everyone conservatively $1200 EOY Overall I‚Äôm expecting 80,000%-150,000% increase in XRP this run (if not more) Now you‚Äôre seeing it from a‚Ä¶ https://t.co/2klSFT1Efm ‚Äî The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 20, 2025 Historical Patterns and Market Outlook The Real Remi Relief draws a compelling parallel between the current XRP price action and its historic breakout during the 2017‚Äì2018 bull run. At that time, XRP defied expectations by rising from mere fractions of a dollar to a peak near $3.84‚Äîan astronomical gain that positioned it temporarily as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Remi believes XRP is now following a similar trajectory, only with even more dramatic implications due to broader adoption, legal clarity, and a maturing crypto market. Based on this historical framework, Remi sets a conservative price expectation of $1,200 by the end of 2025. However, he remains confident that XRP could ultimately exceed this target and reach between $1,700 and beyond during the next market expansion phase. This translates to an unprecedented price appreciation of between 80,000% to 150,000%, which he describes as both historic and transformative. Legal Clarity and Ripple‚Äôs Strategic Positioning One key driver behind Remi‚Äôs optimistic forecast is the increasing legal clarity surrounding XRP and its issuer, Ripple Labs. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres delivered a landmark ruling in the ongoing SEC v. Ripple case, declaring that XRP is not a security when sold on public exchanges. This judgment was widely celebrated as a legal breakthrough for Ripple and a turning point in the broader regulatory landscape for digital assets. Since then, Ripple has aggressively expanded its presence in the global payments ecosystem. With strategic partnerships spanning financial institutions, central banks, and payment corridors across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Ripple is poised to serve as a foundational layer in the future of cross-border settlements. The XRPL‚Äôs rapid development‚Äîincluding its native decentralized exchange (DEX), NFT support, and the recent EVM sidechain innovations by Peersyst Technology‚Äîfurther strengthens the case for XRP‚Äôs utility and long-term value. Macroeconomic Trends and Institutional Demand Beyond the internal XRP ecosystem, macroeconomic forces and growing institutional interest in blockchain-based solutions contribute to Remi‚Äôs bullish thesis. As global economies seek faster, cheaper, and more transparent payment infrastructures, blockchain networks like RippleNet offer a viable alternative to the legacy SWIFT system . Moreover, as central banks continue exploring digital currencies (CBDCs), Ripple‚Äôs CBDC platform, built on the XRP Ledger, positions it as a top contender for technological collaboration. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional investors are also warming up to the crypto sector, driven by the proliferation of regulated financial instruments like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. While XRP has not yet received similar investment vehicles, the recent legal developments and increasing enterprise usage could change that. Remi suggests that once institutions recognize XRP‚Äôs potential as a neutral, bridge asset for global liquidity, demand could surge dramatically, fueling the kind of price explosion he anticipates. Community Reactions and Market Sentiment Remi‚Äôs forecast has sparked both excitement and skepticism across the crypto community. While some users dismiss such projections as overly ambitious, others point to past examples, like Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise from under $1,000 to $69,000, as evidence that such parabolic moves are not only possible but integral to crypto‚Äôs speculative cycles. What sets The Real Remi Relief apart is its detailed comparison of market cycles and unwavering conviction. His call, while extraordinary, echoes a broader sentiment gaining traction among XRP holders: that the asset is significantly undervalued relative to its use case and future potential. As he stated, ‚ÄúHistory will be made,‚Äù capturing the belief that XRP is on the verge of a historic revaluation. The Real Remi Relief‚Äôs 64,000% XRP forecast may seem extreme at first glance, but it is underpinned by a confluence of historical data, technological advancements, and improving regulatory clarity. While such predictions should be approached with cautious optimism, they reflect a growing narrative that XRP could play a central role in the next era of digital finance. With market cycles heating up and institutional capital flowing into the space, XRP‚Äôs journey toward $1,200‚Äîor even $1,700‚Äîmay no longer be a distant fantasy, but a bold possibility rooted in the convergence of history, technology, and belief.

Trader Reveals When As Weekly MACD Turns Bullish","Crypto trader James Wynn has predicted that the Bitcoin price rally is not done , with an all-time high expected to happen soon. This comes as the Bitcoin price has continued to stall between $102,000 and $106,000 with no discernible pattern that could point to where the price could be headed next. While the new all-time high prediction has not come as a surprise to crypto investors, the tight time frame given for the price to hit this target has caught attention. Bitcoin Price Holding Against Bearish Pressure Taking to his X (formerly Twitter) account, the highly profitable crypto trader told his over 63,000 followers that he is expecting the Bitcoin price to continue to rise. He explained that after marking its local bottom at $74,000, the Bitcoin price has managed to stay in the tight channel between $102,000 and $106,000. With the Bitcoin price retesting major support levels but not falling below, Wynn explained that this backed his thesis that the BTC price would not fall again. Despite the fakeout that happened through the weekend, the crypto trader is not deterred, attributing the reversal to market makers pushing the price down in order to liquidate late longs. However, with so many positions already liquidated, he explained that there is no longer a reason for the market makers to keep pushing the price down. For now, the price is showing a lot of strength above $100,000 and the trader believes that this is due to the fact that there is now huge psychological support at $100,000. Furthermore, he explains that even market makers may not have the force required to push the price below this level . BTC Turning Bullish On The Charts In additional to psychological support forming at $100,000 , the Bitcoin price has also been showing a lot of strength on the chart. For one, James Wynn points out that bulls were engulfing candles on the hourly. As a result, panic selling saw weak hands pushed out, as well as market makers running out of steam. Another interesting development is the fact that the Bitcoin price is finally bullish on the weekly MACD . This is importance because the last time that the weekly MACD was bullish was back in November and December 2024. This was when the Bitcoin price had rallied to put in a new all-time high. The current bearish forces plaguing the market is what the analyst refers to as short-term noise before the next run-up. The target for the Bitcoin price? $118,000 and he expects this to happen by the end of next week. If this happens, then BTC could be seeing new peaks in May and going into June with a bullish streak. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fumble your bag, follow proper risk management and look forward to the new highs,‚Äù Wynn told his followers. Wynn has shot up in popularity in the crypto community for his high leverage and often profitable trades on the Hyperliquid platform . So far, he has done more than $3.7 billion in trading volume on the platform with a PNL of almost $50 million and his account balance now sitting above the $58.4 million mark, making him a top 5 trader on the platform.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-118000-before-june/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

However, after some changes were made to the GENIUS law, it is expected to be voted on again in the Senate and the law is expected to pass. At this point, while it is thought that the progress and passage of the GENIUS law will have a positive impact on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said that the groundbreaking stablecoin legislation could pave the way for a crypto bull market that will last for many years. Last week, the 16 Democratic senators who had voted to reject the bill reversed their decision. The GENIUS bill, which is moving forward with the approval process, was voted 66-32 with bipartisan support. The crypto industry hailed the vote as a historic victory that could help ‚Äúsecure the dominance of the US dollar,‚Äù while Bitwise CEO said it paved the way for a bull season that will continue for years to come. ‚ÄúPoliticians in Washington did the right thing.

The passage of the GENIUS Act marks another milestone for the crypto market, as spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January 2024. ‚ÄúI believe this law paves the way for a long-term, sustainable rally in crypto assets beyond Bitcoin. The biggest beneficiaries will be Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and various decentralized finance (DeFi) altcoins like Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE).‚Äù The Bitwise CIO also added that the status of stablecoins, which have been in the gray zone for many years, will be clarified and will allow major banks to issue stablecoins and merchants to accept them. ‚ÄúI predict that the stablecoin market will quickly become a $2.5 trillion market once the legislation is passed. Just close your eyes here and imagine a world where JPMorgan and Bank of America are issuing stablecoins, where Amazon gives you a 2% discount if you buy with stablecoins instead of Visa, and where accepting stablecoins is as common as accepting Venmo or PayPal.

2025-05-21T13:01:52.000Z,"Is BlackRock‚Äôs Spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT Becoming Too Big to Ignore?","Institutional interest in Bitcoin is evolving rapidly, with one issuer now emerging as the dominant player in the ETF space. And that‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT. As one fund pulls ahead of all others, questions emerge about whether institutional demand is being funneled into a monopoly. Bitcoin ETF Monopoly in the Making? Currently, BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) holds over 636,000 BTC. This figure represents more than double the combined holdings of all other US spot Bitcoin ETFs . Since these products were approved in early 2024, IBIT has led the market in both capital inflows and BTC accumulation. While legacy products like Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC continue to bleed assets, IBIT‚Äôs meteoric rise suggests that institutional investors now view it as the primary vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. This concentration raises structural questions. CryptoQuant, in its latest analysis , notes that IBIT‚Äôs size reinforces its visibility and appeal to allocators who would view the largest fund as the most secure option. On the other hand, smaller ETFs face declining liquidity and relevance, which could lead to closures or mergers over time. This shift may result in a market increasingly reliant on a single institutional provider for access to Bitcoin. Drawing comparisons to the consolidation seen in Big Tech markets, CryptoQuant suggests that institutional capital may continue flowing to the most trusted and recognized name. IBIT‚Äôs dominance, the report concludes, is not only changing how institutions gain exposure to Bitcoin but also raising important questions about long-term market structure and concentration. ‚ÄúIBIT isn‚Äôt just winning ‚Äì it‚Äôs redefining the playing field. If current trends continue, Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional narrative may become synonymous with BlackRock. Is this institutional trust ‚Äì or a quiet monopoly in the making?‚Äù IBIT‚Äôs Momentum IBIT continues to gain favor among heavyweight investors. For instance,¬†Mubadala Investment Company, Abu Dhabi‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund, boosted its stake in BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF to 8.7 million shares in Q1 2025, adding nearly $29 million in stock. Citadel Advisors significantly increased its IBIT exposure in Q1 2025, more than tripling its holdings to over 3 million shares valued at roughly $147 million, a sharp rise from around 1 million shares in December, according to a recent filing. Additionally, Hong Kong-based Avenir Group expanded its position in the leading spot Bitcoin ETF in early 2025, as it grew its stake to 14.7 million shares by March 31, up from 11.3 million at the close of 2024.

2025-05-21T13:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Mining Startup Sangha Sees $42M Revenue as It Breaks Ground on West Texas Pilot Project","Sangha Renewables, a bitcoin BTC mining firm that aims to enable renewable energy companies to mine bitcoin, broke ground Wednesday on its flagship 19.9 megawatt (MW) solar facility in West Texas. ‚ÄúWe have been extremely pleased with the development so far,‚Äù Spencer Marr, the firm‚Äôs president, told CoinDesk in a statement. ‚ÄúWe made the decision to use our own funds to buy long lead time electrical infrastructure last November, even prior to the deal closing, to ensure we could be mining as soon as possible, and that has paid off.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe also have a great team of partners and suppliers, including CSD Energy, EcoDigital, Moonshot Electrical, Fusion Industries, Greenhash and Pro Mining Solutions that have all pitched in to make this a success,‚Äù Marr added. Whereas most mining companies focus on acquiring mining rigs and seeking the cheapest electricity contracts possible to produce bitcoin, Sangha‚Äôs approach is markedly different : to convince large renewable energy companies to incorporate bitcoin mining into their own business models. The pitch is simple. Green energy projects often suffer from a mismatch in production and demand. A wind farm, for example, may generate a lot of electricity on a windy night ‚Äî right when everyone is asleep and consumption is lowest. Instead of selling that surplus electricity at a loss, the affected company could potentially switch on bitcoin mining machines and turn a profit. The West Texas project is Sangha‚Äôs pilot program. For now, Sangha itself owns the miner through a series of subsidiaries, and purchases electricity from the energy company, though the energy company may eventually integrate the operation. The project is expected to generate $42 million in revenue in the first 12 months and mine roughly 900 bitcoin over the next 10 years. It will have access to electricity for anywhere between 2.8 cents and 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour on a 30-year lease, meaning that investors will be able to acquire bitcoin at a 25% to 50% discount. Construction is projected to close in the second half of July, though unforeseen events may push that back a month, Marr said. Bitcoin mining should begin soon as construction is complete. ‚ÄúWe expect to commission the project over the summer and use that time to iron out any initial kinks,‚Äù Marr said. ‚ÄúWe purposely ordered 2% more ASICs than we needed to give us a margin of error for faulty machines.‚Äù With $14 million raised so far through equity ‚Äî partially thanks to Plural Energy, which enables mid-sized renewable energy projects to raise funds from investors on-chain ‚Äî Sangha has secured 82% of its $17 million equity round target for the West Texas project. ‚ÄúBy the fall, we expect to be a well-oiled machine and to be utilizing Plural Energy‚Äôs smart contract capabilities to stream distributions to our equity investors, who are excited by the idea of receiving distributions natively in bitcoin,‚Äù Marr said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/21/bitcoin-mining-startup-sangha-breaks-ground-on-west-texas-pilot-project,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Mining|Texas|News",cryptocompare

Users of the Zigi app do not need a crypto wallet or an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to receive the funds, the company said.

2025-05-21T12:57:31.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is This the Final Pullback Before a New All-Time High?","Bitcoin is once again pushing toward its all-time high after a strong continuation from the recent breakout. After breaking past $100K, the price is now consolidating below the ATH level, hinting at either a pause before further upside or potential exhaustion as funding and sentiment heat up. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has broken cleanly out of the descending channel and is now pressing into the $108K ATH resistance zone. The price is confidently trading above both the 100-day (orange) and 200-day (blue) moving averages, reflecting strong macro bullishness. The uptrend remains supported by higher lows and strong momentum, with the RSI trending in the overbought territory near 75. This does suggest potential for a short-term cooldown, but as long as the asset holds above the $100K zone, buyers remain firmly in control. A confirmed daily close above $108K would open the door for price discovery toward the next major psychological level around $115K. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4H chart, Bitcoin has formed a rising channel, pushing into the upper boundary near $108K after a strong rally. The price is currently consolidating within this range, holding above the $104K fair value gap (imbalance), which can act as short-term support. The RSI has also cooled off slightly from overbought levels, but still signals bullish control. A clean breakout above $108K could accelerate price into new highs, while a breakdown below $104K would expose the $100K support zone for a potential retest. As long as the rising channel holds, short-term momentum favors the buyers. Sentiment Analysis Funding Rates From a sentiment perspective, funding rates across exchanges remain elevated. This suggests that the derivatives market is heavily skewed toward longs, and while this supports upward momentum, it also increases the risk of a squeeze if sentiment shifts. On the other hand, exchange reserves continue to decline, reinforcing the longer-term bullish thesis by showing that fewer coins are available to sell on exchanges. As the price pushes toward resistance with bullish derivatives sentiment and a supply-constrained environment, the next few days will be key in confirming whether this rally has more room or needs a deeper reset.

Russia is seeking to crack down on crypto-related crime with a new measure. According to local reports dated May 19, the Russian Ministry of Justice is drafting a bill that would classify crypto assets as property, making them subject to seizure in criminal proceedings. ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Justice has developed a bill that classifies digital currency as property for the purposes of arrest and subsequent confiscation,‚Äù Deputy Minister of Justice, Vadim Fedorov. Fedorov noted that experts would be involved to ensure that these assets could be seized and securely handled. This includes confiscating physical wallets and the necessary credentials, such as seed phrases. Courts may also impose bans on wallet transactions. You might also like: Russia to establish crypto exchange for ‚Äòsuper-qualified investors‚Äô under a pilot regime Russians are increasingly turning to crypto for crime The proposed changes to seizure procedures come in response to the growing use of crypto by criminals in Russia.

You might also like: Exploring crypto‚Äôs most notorious dark web cybercrime forum Fedorov acknowledged the unique challenges of seizing crypto assets and explained why such assets appeal to bad actors. ‚ÄúThe attractiveness of this type of asset for criminals is explained by a number of factors, primarily anonymity and the lack of centralized control.

The situation escalated after the driver offered Irwin-Cline a cigarette, which he suspects was laced with scopolamine ‚Äî a powerful sedative known for its use in South American crimes. ‚ÄúI passed out for what I assumed to be 20 to 30 minutes,‚Äù he recalled. When he regained consciousness, he found himself injured on the side of a road in Golders Green, missing both his phone and memory of how he got there. By the time he returned to his hostel, his laptop had been wiped, and his digital assets had vanished. Screenshots provided to MyLondon show $73,000 worth of XRP and $50,000 in Bitcoin had been moved to various wallets. He believes the stolen funds were funneled through exchanges like MEXC and BTSE, but without insurance or a court order, recovery remains unlikely. The alleged robbery has been reported to the Metropolitan Police, Action Fraud, the FBI‚Äôs Virtual Assets Unit, and Uber. Authorities confirmed that an investigation is underway, but no arrests have been made. The Metropolitan Police said the report was filed the same morning, with cryptocurrency theft estimated at $150,000. Meanwhile, Irwin-Cline is staying in London to cooperate with authorities, though he holds little hope of recovering the stolen funds. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs virtually impossible to get that money back unless some weird miracle happens,‚Äù he said. Crypto Crime Turns Violent as Illicit Transactions Top $40B in 2024 Illicit cryptocurrency activity surged to at least $40.9 billion in 2024, according to Chainalysis, with the number likely to grow as more criminal-linked wallets are identified. Hacks alone accounted for $2.2 billion in stolen assets‚Äîa 21% increase from the previous year. North Korean-linked groups, including Lazarus and Tradetraitor, were behind over 60% of those thefts, with major incidents like the $300 million hack of Japan‚Äôs DMM Bitcoin exchange among their hits. But the threats go beyond online exploits. Criminal groups are using crypto to fund and conceal a wider range of crimes‚Äîfrom investment scams and AI-enhanced romance frauds to drug trafficking and even physical violence.

2025-05-21T12:51:29.000Z,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time Highs, But Retail Interest Still Remains Low","The post Bitcoin Nears All-Time Highs, But Retail Interest Still Remains Low appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is racing fast toward its all-time high of $109,111 , with prices surging. But despite this strong rally, the retail interest is still subdued. Wikipedia searches for cryptocurrencies are low again, even as Bitcoin briefly touched $108,000 level today. This shows that people are not very confident right now. Markets might be in a phase of disbelief or the excitement may have cooled off. Historically, big jumps in interest happened when the market was very excited and prices were at their highest. Low Bitcoin interest despite 6x price jump The search interest related to Bitcoin on Google Trends also remains low. This can be compared to the bear market period of 2022, when Bitcoin was trading only around $16,000. Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs price jumping 6x since 2022, the interest remains significantly low. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Robert Kiyosaki Warns of Economic Collapse, Says Bitcoin Could Hit $1 Million , Do Altcoin rallies trigger real retail hype? One X user observed that retail investors are not excited by Bitcoin‚Äôs price alone. Instead, they tend to jump in when altcoins skyrocket. The takeaway here is that altseason is when retail truly shows up, and that‚Äôs when big players use the hype to sell. Until that euphoric altcoin surge happens, the bull market is not over. This view also aligns with Matrixport‚Äôs take that most Bitcoin is being held by long-term investors and not everyday people. The lack of retail investors may explain why Google search interest for Bitcoin remains low, even as its price approaches record highs. Some in the crypto space see this as a bullish sign, calling it the ‚Äúsilence before the detonation.‚Äù Will The Rally Last? But it also raises concerns over the sustainability of the current rally as the markets may lack the liquidity needed for long-term growth. Still, the long term outlook is optimistic with bullish targets for Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-21T12:44:52.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) holds Above final Resistance Level","The Bitcoin (BTC) price is gathering above the last decent resistance level of $106,000 on Wednesday. Should the bulls manage to close a daily candle above this level, and flip it into support, a rise up and beyond the $109,300 all-time high may not be far away. Positive factors for Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) is only a whisker away from recording an all-time high, the index of the biggest 500 US companies (S&P 500) is doggedly climbing back to all-time highs, and the tariff tantrums are probably mostly behind us. Economic indicators report chooses to focus on consumer sentiment However, the Leading Economy Index (LEI), a composite of several economic indicators, fell 1% in April, which is the biggest fall since March 2023, and it became the fifth monthly decline in a row. A report on the LEI by Newsweek declared that ‚Äúconsumers‚Äô expectations for business conditions‚Äù was one of the most significant of the 10 economic components of the LEI. It also affirmed that ‚Äúconsumer sentiment‚Äù had consistently decreased since the beginning of 2025. While consumer sentiment certainly is a good yardstick for measuring how an economy is doing, the consumers themselves might be among the last to realise that the economy could be in the process of turning a corner, and that economic conditions may be about to pick up. Bullish or bearish short-term for $BTC? Source: TradingView In the short-term 4-hour time frame it can be seen that the $BTC price is flirting closely with the all-time high. Earlier on Wednesday the price ran up to touch $108,000, although it did get sold back down pretty quickly to the tentative $106,100 support level. If this support can hold by the end of the day on Wednesday it could become a base for bulls from which to launch that final assault on the all-time high. Notwithstanding, the current chart pattern of a rising channel is actually a bearish one. In the majority of cases, the price action would be expected to fall out of the bottom of the channel, rather than exit from the top. If the price does start to roll over from here and does fall through the bottom of the channel, a measured move could take $BTC back under $100,000 and down to around $97,000. Perhaps another more likely scenario could be a return to the support at $104,000, or even $102,000. Back to the more bullish scenario, the trend is still up, and a drop back to $106,000 is perfectly fine. If buyers do start getting behind a surge to the all-time high, this could be achieved in a very short amount of time. $DXY about to lose the $100 support Source: TradingView One chart that has a huge impact on the $BTC price is the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The chart shows that with only two days left in this current 2-week time frame, the DXY looks as though it could be about to lose the $100 horizontal support level. The Fibonacci levels for the move from early 2021 up to late 2022 very accurately provide support/resistance lines. The 0.618 is just below the current dollar price, while the 0.786 Fibonacci is likely to be a magnet for the price below this at $94.7. As the US dollar becomes weaker, which is one of the main targets for the Trump administration, asset prices should rise. A leading indicator in this case is probably Bitcoin. Expect the $BTC price to increase as the DXY steadily falls and becomes weaker. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-05-21T12:42:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Report from Crypto Firm Matrixport: 'Spot Demand Surges, Leverage Remains Limited!' Here Are the Details","Crypto financial services provider Matrixport announced in its market analysis dated May 21 that the Bitcoin (BTC) market is showing a historic trend again. Matrixport: Spot Demand Takes Precedence as Bitcoin Price Nears New High, Leverage Risk Limited According to the company‚Äôs assessment, while the Bitcoin price has recently approached record levels again, open positions in the futures market have also reached a historical peak of $34 billion. However, it is noteworthy that funding rates remain at almost zero. Spot Demand Is High, Leverage Is Limited According to Matrixport‚Äôs analysis, this trend shows that spot purchases are driving the market and this time the rise is more organic, not through leveraged transactions. The low funding rates indicate that there is no excessive speculative bubble in the market and therefore the risk of a correction accompanied by high volatility is reduced. The analysis also emphasized that the current market structure is progressing with relatively calm volatility. This reduces the possibility of investors encountering large price fluctuations in the short term. Matrixport‚Äôs assessment also points to a structural change in the Bitcoin market. According to the analysis, long-term investors are now leading the market instead of short-term speculators. This contributes to the formation of a more stable and sustainable market structure. This analysis highlights the role of institutional investors and spot market participants in Bitcoin‚Äôs recent uptrend, while also revealing that the risks of leverage-induced sudden declines remain low. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-21T12:41:08.000Z,"XRP-BTC Pair Flashes First Golden Cross, Hinting at Major Bull Run for XRP","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. The ratio between payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP and bitcoin's (BTC) dollar-denominated prices has triggered its first golden cross on the weekly chart, indicating a bullish shift in momentum. A golden cross occurs when the 50-day/week/month simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day/week/month SMA to indicate that the short-term trend is now outperforming the broader trend, with the potential to evolve into a major bull run. The crossover confirmed on XRP/BTC's weekly chart increased the likelihood of the ratio breaking out of its four-year-long sideways channel, hinting at a major XRP bull run relative to bitcoin. The ratio has been locked in a narrow sideways trend since late 2020, with regulatory uncertainty keeping XRP from cheering the crypto market bull run. However, last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its appeal against a favourable ruling for the XRP user Ripple, which established that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors on public exchanges. In other words, a significant obstacle has moved out of the way, clearing the path for a breakout, suggested by the golden cross. The potential breakout could trigger a substantial rally, driving valuations to record highs. Markets tend to build energy during consolidations, which is then released in the direction of the eventual breakout. Thus, the longer the consolidation, the more pronounced and rapid the resulting price movement is likely to be.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/21/xrp-btc-pair-flashes-first-golden-cross-hinting-at-major-bull-run-for-xrp,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|Markets|News",cryptocompare

Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target‚Äôs real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker‚Äôs address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O‚ÄôConnor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they‚Äôve been ‚Äúapplying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.‚Äù The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:‚ÄúMost existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.‚ÄúThe newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks.

Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers.¬†‚ÄúJust as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,‚Äù Peirce said.¬†Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits ‚Äútraditionally associated with securities.‚ÄùSEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood.¬†Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports.¬†‚ÄúSo Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,‚Äù Tan told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúThe actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.‚ÄùThe lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. ‚ÄúThe artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,‚Äù he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income.¬†Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is ‚Äúanalogous to business income,‚Äù which the SEC does not regulate. He added:¬†‚ÄúThe SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.‚ÄùTan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator.¬†Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. ‚ÄúAsk yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf none, slow down.‚ÄùSource: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case.

Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors.Cointelegraph contacted South Korea‚Äôs Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.Related:¬†RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cardsSouth Korean candidates push pro-crypto agendaSouth Korea‚Äôs Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, aiming to curb capital flight and bolster the country‚Äôs financial autonomy.Speaking at a recent policy forum, Lee said a won-based stablecoin could help retain domestic wealth and reduce dependence on foreign-backed digital currencies such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC).The initiative is part of Lee‚Äôs broader push for digital asset reforms, which also includes legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party, has also expressed support for introducing spot crypto ETFs, signaling bipartisan momentum on the issue.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-tightens-kyc-rules-ahead-of-institutional-crypto-entry?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What‚Äôs often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here‚Äôs the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.¬†                  Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip ‚Äî wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee ‚Äî tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here‚Äôs a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient‚Äôs wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger‚Äôs wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That‚Äôs a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient‚Äôs supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can‚Äôt handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network ‚Äî like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain ‚Äî can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract‚Äôs code has flaws or can‚Äôt handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion ‚Äî especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space ‚Äî and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven‚Äôt landed.If your crypto transfer isn‚Äôt received, don‚Äôt panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient‚Äôs address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient‚Äôs wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you‚Äôre sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you‚Äôre sending. And don‚Äôt forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you‚Äôll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer‚Äôs going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network‚Äôs typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight.¬†And they‚Äôre not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That‚Äôs why knowing the average speed of the network you‚Äôre using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly.¬†Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre racing to secure a trade or make a payment ‚Äî choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn‚Äôt line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits.¬†If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn‚Äôt match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the ‚Äúsunrise issue,‚Äù where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven‚Äôt. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions.¬†Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won‚Äôt process transfers to wallets they can‚Äôt verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.¬†                  How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much.¬†Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely.¬†Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine.¬†One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn‚Äôt just about saving your wallet; it‚Äôs about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here‚Äôs the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you‚Äôre using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don‚Äôt rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That‚Äôs when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username ‚ÄúSun,‚Äù which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, ‚Äútalk crypto,‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscuss the future‚Äù of the industry. It‚Äôs unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president‚Äôs family.¬†In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and ‚ÄúVIP tour‚Äù for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump‚Äôs memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump‚Äôs three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election.

The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun‚Äôs announcement.‚ÄúHow convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun ‚Äî a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture ‚Äî announces he‚Äôs getting a private dinner as the president‚Äôs top crypto buyer,‚Äù said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn‚Äôt stop this type of corruption ‚Äî it greenlights it.‚ÄùAt a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun‚Äôs case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump‚Äôs memecoin.

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.‚ÄúIf you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,‚Äù Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE‚Äôs efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‚Äòmission-focused company‚ÄôArmstrong‚Äôs remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE‚Äôs actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO‚Äôs position before Trump‚Äôs second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California‚Äôs Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats.¬†In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a ‚Äúmission-focused company‚Äù that didn‚Äôt ‚Äúadvocate for any particular causes or candidates.‚ÄùIn response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an ‚Äúapolitical culture‚Äù and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel they could be on board with this direction‚Äù had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt‚Äôs not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be ‚Äúapolitical,‚Äù the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group ‚Äúfocused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.‚ÄùBefore Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn‚Äôt on partisan politics, but ‚Äúcommon-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.‚Äù¬†‚ÄúBeing anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,‚Äù said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase‚Äôs shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was ‚Äúprepared to work with either administration‚Äù in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump‚Äôs inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was ‚Äúan important signal about where things are going.‚Äù¬†The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets.¬†Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong¬†Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In ‚ÄúFat Protocols,‚Äù Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads ‚Äî but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto‚Äôs liquidity crisisBut without ‚Äúroads,'‚Äô it's impossible to navigate and access ‚Äúcities.'‚Äô Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.‚ÄúValue‚Äù doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump‚Äôs cryptocurrency dealings.The bill‚Äôs opponents hailed lawmakers‚Äô refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family‚Äôs crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers‚Äô approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was ‚Äúnot perfect, but it‚Äôs far better than the status quo.‚ÄùWarner set corruption concerns aside, stating, ‚ÄúMany senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family‚Äôs use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.‚ÄùWarner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions.¬†Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill‚Äôs sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately.¬†Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill‚ÄúA lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,‚Äù she said, adding that she didn‚Äôt want the president‚Äôs scandals to ‚Äúdistract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.‚ÄùDuring the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, ‚ÄúA bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President‚Äôs corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.‚ÄùDemocrats opposing the bill aren‚Äôt giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named ‚Äúthe STABLE GENIUS Act,‚Äù combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from ‚Äúissuing or endorsing digital assets‚Äù and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing ‚Äî numerous acts that would limit members‚Äô of Congress financial activities have fizzled out ‚Äî it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers.¬†In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position.¬†Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump‚Äôs mass deportations further deepened the rift.¬†Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill.

The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections.¬†Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the ‚ÄúLeaders We Deserve‚Äù campaign ‚Äî an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration.¬†With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills.

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering‚Äôs power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack.¬†Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million.¬†The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering ‚Äî exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance.¬†A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds.¬†While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias ‚ÄúX,‚Äù allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as ‚ÄúW0rk.‚Äù Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn‚Äôt just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security.¬†Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims.¬†Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want.¬†Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent ‚Äúloss‚Äù or claim a reward.¬†Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards.¬†Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior.¬†Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds.¬†Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn‚Äôt target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials.¬†Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims.¬†Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets.¬†These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack.¬†Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days.¬†Lazarus Group‚Äôs fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies.¬†Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements.¬†In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available.¬†Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren‚Äôt assured.¬†Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins ‚Äî worth about $2.1 billion ‚Äî were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG‚Äôs crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.‚ÄúIn particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis‚Äôs books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,‚Äù the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.‚ÄúGBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,‚Äù the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG‚Äôs investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis‚Äôs bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX ‚Äî moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General‚Äôs civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa‚Äôs XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
