2025-05-21T19:00:14.000Z,"Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst","Litecoin is holding steady at a critical level after a strong 69% surge in the past month, riding the wave of broader market momentum. As Bitcoin flirts with its all-time high, analysts are closely watching LTC for signs of a potential breakout or breakdown. The current price action shows consolidation near a crucial demand zone, which has historically served as a pivot for Litecoin’s major moves. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key While bullish sentiment is building across the crypto market, not all analysts are convinced. Some warn that if Bitcoin fails to break into price discovery and the broader market stalls, Litecoin could face renewed selling pressure. However, top analyst Carl Runefelt remains optimistic, sharing a technical view that suggests Litecoin is forming a bullish flag pattern on the chart—a structure that often precedes strong upward continuation. Runefelt’s target points to a breakout above the current range, supported by healthy market structure and recent gains. Still, the coming days will determine whether LTC follows through with a rally or pulls back. For now, Litecoin stands at a technical crossroads, with both opportunity and risk on the table. Litecoin Eyes Breakout As Market Awaits BTC Confirmation Litecoin is currently trading at a pivotal level, caught in the middle of growing speculation about the market’s next major move. After a powerful 69% rally over the past month, LTC has entered a phase of consolidation, holding just above a crucial support level. The broader crypto market is in a similar position, with investors watching closely for a potential breakout in Bitcoin that could pull the rest of the market higher. As Bitcoin hovers just below its all-time high, Litecoin traders are holding their breath. Many believe that a breakout above the $109K mark for BTC could serve as a catalyst for altcoins, especially LTC. But not everyone agrees—some analysts expect the market to cool down first, leading to a deeper correction before any renewed upside. Runefelt is firmly in the bullish camp. He recently shared a technical analysis highlighting a bullish flag pattern forming on Litecoin’s chart. According to Runefelt, Litecoin has already bounced from support, and this setup presents a high-probability breakout scenario. His price target for the move is $117.5, which would mark a significant push higher from current levels. Runefelt’s view aligns with the broader bullish sentiment that’s slowly rebuilding across the market. However, the confirmation remains dependent on both Litecoin’s ability to break above short-term resistance and Bitcoin’s performance near its all-time high. For now, LTC investors remain cautiously optimistic, aware that momentum could shift quickly depending on macro market developments. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Technical Details: Key Levels To Watch Litecoin (LTC) is currently trading at $95.35, showing resilience after a brief pullback from its recent local high near $106. The chart highlights a period of consolidation, with LTC finding support just above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $93.82 and slightly below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $100.76. These two moving averages are now acting as a technical pivot zone, creating both resistance and support that could define LTC’s next move. After a strong rally from April lows around $66, Litecoin surged over 69% before facing resistance at the psychological $100 level. The price is now hovering in a tightening range, which could develop into a bullish continuation pattern—especially if broader market sentiment remains positive and Bitcoin pushes above its all-time high. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? Volume has slightly decreased during the recent pullback, indicating a lack of strong selling pressure. This supports the bullish thesis that the current move is a healthy consolidation rather than the start of a reversal.

2025-05-21T18:44:46.000Z,"XRP Price Suddenly Drops by 5% as Ripple Whales Offload Tokens","TL;DR Ripple whales have reversed their investment strategy by offloading over 60 million tokens within the span of just three days. XRP’s price went on the offensive earlier today, but it was stopped at over $2.4 and pushed south by roughly 5%. Whales have sold over 60 million $XRP in the last 72 hours! pic.twitter.com/nx13u9nthS — Ali (@ali_charts) May 21, 2025 The 60 million tokens offloaded by large Ripple investors equal roughly $140 million, according to current prices. While this doesn’t sound like a big number when we are talking about a cryptocurrency with a market cap of almost $140 billion, the relatively small timeframe of just 72 hours is what’s more worrying. Additionally, it showcases a highly different investment strategy for whales. Recall that these market participants, who have the ability to impact market prices with large sales or purchases, went on a massive accumulation spree in April, adding over 900 million tokens. The revelation today coincided with an intriguing price move by XRP. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency started to gain traction alongside the rally in the rest of the market, in which BTC skyrocketed to a new all-time high, and surged from $2.34 to a multi-day peak of almost $2.44. However, it faced an immediate and violent rejection at that point and was pushed south to the starting level within hours. As of now, XRP is back to around $2.35, which is just above a crucial support line ($2.3) that many believe could make or break the asset’s short- to medium-term price movements. XRPUSD.

2025-05-21T18:42:58.000Z,"Ripple Acquiring Circle Would Lead To ‘Crypto Apocalypse,’ Warns Legal Expert","Ripple’s expansion strategy this year has led to an attempt to acquire stablecoin issuer Circle. As ZyCrypto reported recently, the New York-based issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, held informal talks with stablecoin rival Ripple and its long-time partner, Coinbase, about a potential sale, with the company seeking at least $5 billion. While Ripple seems more aggressive and owns a huge hoard of XRP tokens, Coinbase may still have the edge, given its deep history with Circle. “If Coinbase wanted to buy them, Circle would sell in a heartbeat,” a source reportedly revealed. For Ripple, owning Circle would give it an instant seat at the table in the global stablecoin economy as the blockchain payments firm begins to clear some of its legal entanglements with US regulators. However, skeptics are already throwing up antitrust red flags and cautioning of a potential disaster if the deal with Ripple succeeds. A Potential Disaster Brewing? However, a popular lawyer has suggested that Ripple’s potential takeover of Circle could have a considerable negative impact on the wider crypto market. “This could end up being crypto apocalypse. Making Ripple the largest asset issuer on every blockchain would obviously be disastrous and anticompetitive,” MetaLeX Labs founder Gabriel Shapiro wrote on X. Shapiro pointed out that Ripple previously used its influence to harm its competitors by spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). In 2022, for instance, Ripple’s Chris Larsen teamed up with Greenpeace to force a BTC code change to reduce the energy use of the industry’s largest cryptocurrency by market value. Moreover, Shapiro believes that even if the acquisition by Ripple is successful, it will likely fail to pass antitrust muster. Regulators review deals for antitrust concerns, indicating that they will determine whether the deal could give Ripple too much control over the stablecoin business. “If a definitive agreement is signed, we will be at the DoJ’s and FTC’s doorstep, citing Ripple’s history of campaigns against Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Shapiro continued. The pundit further argued that Circle should consider the Revlon doctrine, which posits that a company should choose the best deal for its shareholders — including weighing antitrust risk.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquiring-circle-would-lead-to-crypto-apocalypse-warns-legal-expert/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T18:34:30.000Z,"KAITO price surges as funding rate exits danger zone","Kaito token price surged to its highest level since March 2 as demand for cryptocurrencies jumped. Kaito ( KAITO ), a top player in the artificial intelligence and data analytics industry, rose to a high of $2.2524, up by 240% from its lowest level this year. This rally brought its market cap to $525 million and its fully diluted valuation to $2.17 billion. Kaito token jumped as the mood in the crypto market improved, as Bitcoin ( BTC ) soared to a record high. This surge pushed most altcoins higher, with tokens like Cookie DAO, Haedal Protocol, Grass, and Dogwifhat soaring by over 20%. Kaito has also jumped as more people staked their tokens. Data show that it has a staking yield of 11%, higher than popular tokens like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ). Per Dune Analytics, there are over 15,000 stakers in the network, while the total Kaito tokens jumped to a record high of 21 million KAITO.

More data shows that Kaito made over $32.9 million in the first quarter as the number of monthly yappers rose to over 200,000. These numbers mean that the Kaito ecosystem is growing. Kaito price also jumped as CoinGlass data shows that the weighted funding rate exited the negative zone, where it has remained since May 10. The rate rose to 0.0038%, the highest point in weeks. Kaito funding rate | Source: Coinglass A positive funding rate is a sign that investors anticipate that the Kaito price will be higher in the future than it is today. Kaito price technical analysis Kaito price chart | Source: crypto.news The eight-hour chart shows that the Kaito token price made a strong bullish breakout on Wednesday. It moved above the important resistance level at $2.1267, the upper side of the forming bullish flag chart pattern. A bullish flag is a popular continuation sign. It has moved above the 50-period moving average and the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. It is also being supported by the Supertrend indicator, a sign that the bulls are in control. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the Kaito price is bullish, with the next point to watch being the all-time high of $2.92, up by 32% above the current level. A move below the support at $2 will invalidate the bullish view.

2025-05-21T18:32:07.000Z,"Bitcoin Pushes Towards $130K Breakout After Setting New All-Time High","After quietly printing a fresh record at $109,487.23 on Wednesday , Bitcoin’s spotlight has already shifted to whether a $3.6 billion May ETF buying wave can catapult the coin through $120K. Analysts now treat $130K—once a bold call—as only an early waypoint toward summer highs. A bullish golden cross, renewed whale accumulation, and soaring basis yields also have some desks sketching a $150K ceiling before year-end. Bitcoin hits new all-time high/ Source: CoinMarketCap ETF Inflows Fuel $130K Forecasts Investor confidence has increased in Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in particular. To put this rally in context, after the first gold ETF launched in 2004, gold prices skyrocketed about 250% over the subsequent years. Analysts suggest Bitcoin’s trajectory could mirror gold’s post-ETF surge, especially given Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycles that historically precede bull runs. In May alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have attracted over $3.6 billion in net inflows, already exceeding April’s total of $2.97 billion and reversing the outflows seen earlier this year. According to data from SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs saw $329.02 million in net inflows on May 20 alone, bringing the week’s total to $996.46 million. Source: SoSoValue This turnaround comes after a sharp dip in April when Bitcoin fell to a year-to-date low of $74,393 and ETF outflows hit $4.6 billion between February and March. Improved macroeconomic conditions, particularly easing tensions between the U.S. and China, have also helped to restore investor sentiment. For instance, on May 8, Bitcoin ETFs reached an all-time high in total inflows, surpassing $41 billion since their launch in early 2024. ETF total net inflows just set a new high. $41,5B in net inflows since the 11th of January 2024. Extremely bullish for Bitcoin! pic.twitter.com/GXeLQUlDuN — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) May 16, 2025 Leading the charge is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has attracted $6.96 billion in year-to-date inflows, surpassing even the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), the world’s largest gold ETF, which has drawn $6.5 billion. Technical Indicators Support Bullish Case The long-term buying pressure from whales (large holders) further supports the outlook for a continued rally. “Bitcoin is going to all-time highs today,” popular analyst AlphaBTC explained on May 21, pointing to a chart that showed Bitcoin trading within a rising channel since its April 9 rebound. #Bitcoin ATH today Seem inevitable that $BTC take out the ATH soon, this grind and pop (squeeze) PA is being driven by bigger players that have their targets and know what it takes to use the Bears shorting every pop to move price higher. #Crypto #BTC https://t.co/LpBS0ZjXtw pic.twitter.com/6tYgVHTHlT — AlphaBTC (@mark_cullen) May 21, 2025 Order book data from CoinGlass shows strong buying interest just below the $106K mark, providing a cushion of support as well. From a technical standpoint, the moving average ribbon suggests a strong uptrend. Short-term moving averages (20- and 50-day) have crossed above long-term ones (100- and 200-day), forming a golden cross, a bullish indicator that often precedes extended gains. Currently, BTC is testing the psychological level of $110K. If it breaks above this level with strong volume, the next potential targets could be around $120K, assuming no immediate macroeconomic shifts. On the downside, any short-term pullback may find support at $102K or the 20-day SMA near $101K. Bitcoin appears set for further gains, with market observers now focusing on when, rather than if, it will reach $130K soon.

Speaking recently on the Bankless YouTube channel, Arthur Hayes detailed the strategy of his company, the Maelstrom Fund, and while he expects a strong rally in Bitcoin, he warned that there will be a sharp correction before the 2025 peak and announced his Ethereum price forecast. First, Hayes said that the Maelstrom Fund is largely backed by two major cryptocurrencies. Stating that these are Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hayes said that they consist of 60 percent BTC and 20 percent ETH. “Maelstrom is about 60% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum. And then there's a bunch of other shitcoins. Non-crypto assets include physical gold, gold mining stocks, and treasury bonds.” Watch Out for a Sharp Correction in Bitcoin! Arthur Hayes once again stated that he is bullish on Bitcoin. At this point, the famous name expects BTC to rise to $ 150,000-200,000 by the summer of 2025, and to rise to $ 250,000 by the end of 2025. However, Hayes warned of a major correction, at which point Hayes stated that he expects a sharp correction before Bitcoin breaks out to $250,000 by the end of 2025. “From now on, Bitcoin will rally towards $150,000 to $200,000 by summer. But then we'll have a bad, sharp correction and then I think we'll hit $250,000 in Bitcoin by the end of the year.” What is the Expectation for Ethereum? Hayes, who expects a big rally in Bitcoin, stated that Ethereum faces a more difficult path. Stating that the critical level for ETH is $ 5,000, Hayes said that $ 5,000 should be exceeded by the end of the year. According to Hayes, breaking $5,000 by the end of the year would be a significant milestone and could reignite excitement that could propel ETH to $10,000 or even $20,000 at its cycle peak. “If Ethereum can reach $5,000 by the end of the year, it will likely fuel the bulls. This level will revive investors’ excitement and allow ETH to experience a big rally. And eventually ETH may reach $10,000 or even $20,000. But I think it's a tough road for ETH from current levels to $5,000.” *This is not investment advice.

The gradual increase of crypto FOMO has coincided with the stealth quantitative easing (QE) from the Fed. Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied over 4 percent in the past 24 hours to surpass a previous psychological ceiling of about $109,353 and reach a record new all-time high of around $109,864 on Wednesday, May 11 during the mid North American trading session. Bitcoin’s market cap surpassed $2.17 trillion, thus overtaking Amazon and Google to become the 5th biggest asset in the world. The wider altcoin market followed in tandem, thus the total crypto market cap rising to around $3.57 trillion. Consequently, around $400 million was rekt from the crypto leveraged, mostly involving short traders. Major Forces Behind Bitcoin Pump Today Debt Crisis in the United States As the tariff war eases, investors’ concerns have shifted to the high U.S. debt amid anticipated stagflation. Earlier this week, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, highlighted that the $36 trillion U.S. debt, which is 122 percent of the country’s GDP, is a major concern. Meanwhile, the Fed recently repurchased more than $43 billion in U.S. treasuries, thus quietly returning to quantitative easing (QE). On Wednesday, the 20-year U.S. Treasury yield climbed 5.104 percent, the highest level since November 2023. As a result, Robert Kiyosaki, a financial educator, noted that the U.S. dollar will continue to weaken and push BTC price and Gold higher in the near term. Crypto Regulatory Clarity in the U.S. On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate advanced the GENIUS Act on stablecoins with the needed threshold of 60 votes. The bill now faces possible amendments, which could set the stage for enactment by August. The notable advancement of crypto regulations in the United States will help in the mainstream adoption of digital assets, particularly by institutional investors. Stablecoin legislation is about to pass the Senate, and Bitcoin just hit a new all time high. — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) May 21, 2025 Rising Demand from Institutional Investors The overall demand for Bitcoin by institutional investors, led by the U.S. spot BTC ETF issuers and Strategy, has significantly increased in the past month.

As Bitcoin gains traction, three altcoins stand out with possible explosive growth ahead. For those keen on the next big opportunities in the crypto world, the following coins may be primed for remarkable advances. Avalanche's Volatile Journey and Key Price Levels AVAX price action shows a 14% advance in the last month paired with a stark 38% decline over the past six months and a recent weekly drop of roughly 13%. Past movements reveal swift reversals and recovery periods that highlight a fluctuating market history. Momentum has shifted rapidly, emphasizing the potential gains and risks traders faced during these phases. Currently, the coin trades between $16 and $24 with immediate resistance around $27.94 and support near $11.13. The absence of a clear trend creates mixed signals, as slight upward momentum competes with bearish pressures. Traders may consider short-term plays within this range, looking to test the $36.34 resistance if bullish energy builds further. Maker's Price Dynamics Amid Short-Term Volatility Maker exhibited notable short-term activity with a robust month-on-month gain of 26.49%, while its half-year progress remained modest at a 4.70% increase. Recent price swings underline active market participation with a one-week drop of 9.36%, reflecting dynamic fluctuations and a mix of buying and selling actions that shaped its performance over these intervals. Current trading levels reveal Maker oscillating between $1082 and $1836, with key support at $687 and resistance at $2195. Bulls appear to be trying to push higher, but bears have interjected, as seen in the recent decline and mixed momentum indicators. Traders may find opportunities by watching for potential reversals near support and breakout moves at resistance. IOTA Sees Strong Monthly Gains and Consistent Growth Over Six Months Past data shows a 33.84% price increase in the last month and a 28.09% gain over six months. IOTA has delivered notable short-term strength while maintaining moderate upward progress over a longer period. The overall performance indicates renewed market interest and a shift toward bullish sentiment, with investors reacting well to recent moves. The price now trades between $0.144 and $0.256 with immediate resistance at $0.30 and secondary resistance at $0.42, and support around $0.08. Technical indicators are mixed with a near-neutral RSI of 51.26. The market appears range-bound, suggesting traders could consider buying near support and watch for a breakout above resistance levels for potential gains. Conclusion Bitcoin's rise in value might signal that several other cryptocurrencies could see significant growth. AVAX , MKR , and IOTA are three coins that show potential. These altcoins could benefit from the increased interest and investment in the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues its upward trend, a ripple effect may occur, driving more attention to these promising altcoins. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With price testing resistance, a potential pullback to strong support could trigger a move into all-time high territory. Strategy’s stock (MSTR) is currently trading in a bullish market structure, mirroring the recent price action of Bitcoin ( BTC ). With a history of aggressive BTC accumulation, MSTR has shown a strong correlation to Bitcoin’s movements, and this correlation may once again lead the stock into new all-time highs.

Key technical points Major Support Zone: $362.50 — confluence of value area low, 21 EMA, and 200 MA Market Structure: Higher highs and higher lows since the recent swing low Volume Behavior: Declining volume suggests imminent influx following consolidation Potential Target: Expansion into ATH price discovery if resistance breaks or holds post-correction MSTR (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView The current price action on MSTR reflects a sustained bullish structure. Since establishing a swing low, the stock has consistently formed higher highs and higher lows, a classic sign of trend continuation. It is now testing a significant resistance zone. If this resistance holds, a short-term correction could follow. This potential pullback may bring price back to the $362.50 support zone, an area with strong technical confluence. The value area low, 21-day exponential moving average, and 200-day moving average all converge at this level. A correction into this zone would likely establish a higher low and provide the structural base for the next upward move.

Importantly, a breakout above the current high without a correction would also signal strong bullish momentum. It would suggest continued buying pressure and increase the likelihood of price rotation into discovery mode and the formation of new all-time highs, similar to Bitcoin’s recent breakout. MSTR’s historical price action has often mirrored that of Bitcoin, and this technical alignment reinforces the bullish outlook. What to expect in the coming price action If MSTR holds above the $362.50 support region or breaks above current resistance directly, the probability of a move into all-time highs increases significantly. Traders should watch for either a structured pullback or a clean breakout, both scenarios support continued upside.

2025-05-21T18:05:41.000Z,"Bitcoin Breaks New All-Time Highs As BTC Ownership in the US Surpasses Gold, Becomes ‘America’s Emerging Reserve Asset’","Bitcoin printed yet another all-time high on Monday as BTC becomes more widely held by Americans than gold, according to a new report. Bitcoin-focused exchange River says new data shows that BTC is now “America’s emerging reserve asset,” and those living in the country own about 40% of the flagship crypto’s total supply, valued at more than $790 billion. According to River, 49.6 million Americans now own Bitcoin, while just 36.7 million Americans own gold. “Until 1971, gold was the primary reserve asset of the United States, backing the value of the US dollar and serving as a trusted store of value for many Americans. While gold remains an important investment asset, its role has diminished over time. Bitcoin has now surpassed gold in ownership among individual Americans. At the national level, the US government is pulling ahead of global rivals such as China by embracing Bitcoin. Earlier this year, the White House officially designated Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. The federal government’s Bitcoin holdings now represent twice its global market share of gold reserves.” Source: River Bitcoin soared past its previous all-time high of about $108,700 on Wednesday, breaking above $109,000 for the first time in its history.

The latest milestone involves the listing of XRP and Micro XRP futures on the CME Group, which marks a notable milestone for the cryptocurrency. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, recently took to social media to share this exciting announcement, while Ripple issued a critical alert for crypto investors. Ripple CEO Hails Institutional Breakthrough For XRP Brad Garlinghouse took to the social media platform X to mark what he described as a key institutional milestone for XRP: the official launch of both XRP and Micro XRP futures contracts on CME Group, the largest derivatives marketplace in the world. Interestingly, the contracts were quick to become active, as Garlinghouse also confirmed that the first block trade on CME had already been executed by Hidden Road, a prominent institutional trading firm. This move introduces XRP to a regulated derivatives framework, which traditionally appeals to asset managers, hedge funds, and other large-scale investors. It places XRP in the same category as Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which saw improved investor confidence and deeper market activity after their own CME futures listings. As such, the launch of XRP and Micro XRP futures plays well into the current market dynamics for XRP, especially in terms of growing institutional interest. Furthermore, the presence of XRP futures on the CME marketplace shows that the cryptocurrency is maturing into a more structured financial asset, which could influence future decisions of the SEC around Spot XRP ETFs . CME Group XRP futures are available in both a micro-sized (2,500 XRP) and a larger-sized contract (50,000 XRP). According to Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products at CME Group, more than $19 million in notional volume was traded on the first day of launch. Ripple Issues Major Alert To Investors Shortly after the announcement of the futures launch, Ripple’s official account posted a public service warning highlighting a rise in scams targeting the XRP community. The company urged users to stay alert, noting that no official Ripple representative would ever ask individuals to send XRP. The warning included a reminder to avoid suspicious links and noted the importance of verifying accounts before engaging. This alert is based on a pattern in the crypto space, as scam activity tends to rise when markets are bullish. One such example is the recent arrest of a Wellington-based man by the New Zealand Police in connection with a crime syndicate accused of stealing $450 million New Zealand dollars ($265 million). Crypto exchange Coinbase was also recently subjected to a phishing attac k that resulted in the leak of a small fraction of user data.

According to market data, Bitcoin broke its all-time high price record today, reaching $109,496 on Coinbase. This new high comes 121 days after the previous record of $109,353. Bitcoin has risen 47% since bottoming at $74,508 on April 9. As a result of this rise, Bitcoin's market dominance increased to 64.25%, while the total market value of altcoins decreased by 26.67% from its current peak.

With price now testing major resistance, consolidation could pave the way for a breakout toward higher targets. Cookie Coin ( COOKIE ) has shown remarkable strength, rising more than 27% following a precise bounce off a high-timeframe support level at $0.15. This wasn’t just any level, it marked the confluence of multiple technical indicators, including the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, the channel low of a bullish trading channel, and the 200-day moving average. The alignment of these indicators provided a high-confidence entry zone, which has now led to a powerful upside move. Currently, Cookie is trading at a key resistance area near $0.22, a level that demands attention from both bulls and bears. This resistance aligns with the upper boundary of the bullish trading channel, as well as a volume profile value-up resistance pulled from the all-time high. Despite testing this critical zone, Cookie remains structurally bullish. Key technical points Major Support Held: $0.15 support held strong, backed by 0.618 Fib, 200 MA, and channel support Current Resistance: Testing $0.22 zone, in confluence with HTF channel resistance and volume node Market Structure: Higher highs and higher lows remain intact Potential Next Target: Breakout above $0.22 could send price toward $0.26 COOKIEDAOUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView The recent move from $0.15 to $0.22 was not only sharp but also technically sound. The support zone at $0.15 acted as a stronghold of confluence, providing a solid launchpad for this breakout. As Cookie now tests the $0.22 resistance zone, it faces its next significant challenge. A clean break above this resistance may not occur immediately. Given the scale of the recent move, a consolidation phase would be a healthy development. Ideally, traders should look for the formation of a bullish pennant or a short-term ascending channel just below resistance. These structures often precede breakout moves, allowing the market to gather momentum. You might also like: BTC surges: Explore cloud mining with BTC to earn $20,000 a day While there’s always the possibility of a continued pump without consolidation, the more sustainable path would involve some sideways movement that builds pressure beneath the $0.22 level. If that occurs, it could act as a launchpad toward the next resistance at $0.26, a natural magnet for price continuation. What to expect in the coming price action If Cookie consolidates under $0.22 and maintains its bullish structure, a breakout toward $0.26 is highly probable. The overall trend remains strong, and technicals support continued movement to higher levels with a confirmed bullish setup.

2025-05-21T17:45:31.000Z,"Tariff Truce and Liquidity Fuel Bitcoin to $109,000 All-Time High — What’s Next for BTC?","Bitcoin price rallied to a new all-time high above $109,000 on May 21, propelled by a sudden thaw in global trade tensions and expectations of looser monetary policy. The cryptocurrency traded around $109,369 on late trading, extending a rally that lifted prices about 6% in the past week. This move follows a breakthrough above $100,000 earlier in May, as investors responded to signs that President Trump’s global tariff offensive might be easing. Trade Truce Sparks Global Rally The immediate catalyst was a surprise 90-day “tariff truce” between the United States and China . On May 12, officials in Geneva announced a pause on new levies and sharp rollbacks of existing duties, slashing reciprocal tariffs by roughly 115 percentage points to about 10%. Global markets leaped on the news: stock futures and Asian equities jumped, and commodity prices rallied on hopes of a broad trade-war détente. Bitcoin investors also took notice. Analysts note that the tariff pause removed the risk of ‘sudden re‑escalation’, which had been weighing on risk appetite. In other words, as the trade conflict eased, risk assets like Bitcoin rallied without the overhang of fresh tariffs. Liquidity Surge and Institutional Flows Broader macroeconomic conditions have added fuel to the crypto rally. Central banks worldwide are signaling easier policy. In the U.S., futures markets are now priced at multiple rate cuts this year, and a weaker dollar has coincided with renewed growth in global money supply. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has maintained an accommodative stance, and the Bank of Japan continues massive asset purchases, reinforcing the loose global liquidity backdrop. China’s central bank has also begun pumping cash into markets. Such ample liquidity typically lifts risk assets, and Bitcoin has benefited accordingly. At the same time, institutional investors have been pouring into crypto. Hedge funds and asset managers have funneled record sums into spot-Bitcoin ETFs and futures, betting on higher prices. Leading figures in the crypto industry have expressed firm bullish conviction. Former PayPal and Meta executive David Marcus tweeted , “ the bull case for Bitcoin has never been stronger,” citing easier custody solutions at banks and competition from sovereign and corporate buyers. Changpeng Zhao, co-founder of Binance, echoed this optimism. Analysts even project Bitcoin could reach around $150,000 if regulatory conditions remain favorable. Bitcoin Market Outlook Looking ahead, analysts are divided on just how far Bitcoin can climb. Some have raised year-end targets above $130,000. Jamie Coutts of Real Vision warns that the relentless expansion of fiat money means Bitcoin “may push…above $132,000” by late 2025. Source: X Even major banks have revised their models: Standard Chartered’s crypto research team recently suggested that a $120,000 second-quarter price target might be “too low”. On the other hand, many caution that the rally could pause or correct if global liquidity peaks or regulators tighten. Bitcoin’s price historically follows four-year “halving” cycles tied to new coin issuance, and some forecasters see the current monetary easing lasting through 2025. Those forces could cool Bitcoin’s momentum if central banks eventually reverse course or inflation spikes. For now, however, the rare alignment of easing trade tensions and abundant liquidity, coupled with growing institutional adoption, has set the stage for one of crypto’s strongest rallies.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/tariff-truce-and-liquidity-fuel-bitcoin-to-109000-all-time-high-whats-next-for-btc/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

Michael Saylor , whose company is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ), made the statement as the latest Bitcoin rally sent BTC to a new all-time high above $109,500. The spike also pushed 100% of Bitcoin-holding addresses into profit. But despite the rally to a record high for the benchmark digital asset, Saylor took to X to share his bullish take on BTC. “If you’re not buying bitcoin at the all-time high, you’re leaving money on the table,” the MicroStrategy founder posed via X. His remarks echo a previous statement, also shared via the platform, as Bitcoin approached its prior all-time high. You might also like: BREAKING: Bitcoin hits new all-time high at $109,400.68 The Strategy founder’s comments align with his recent prediction that BTC may soon become too expensive for investors who hesitate at current levels. In his view, this scenario is likely amid an impending wave of institutional investment into Bitcoin. Specifically, analysts suggest that banks and other financial institutions are on the verge of a major push into Bitcoin. When this happens, the price could skyrocket, and those who miss out, even at today’s record highs, may not be able to buy in later. “When banks finally bless Bitcoin and the experts agree it’s a good idea,everyone will want to buy it,no one will need to sell it,and you won’t be able to afford it,” Saylor said in late April.

The bill passed in a 101-42 vote and will now go to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to either sign into law or veto. SB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period. Currently, the only cryptocurrency fitting the requirement is Bitcoin. Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione presenting SB 21. Source: Bitcoin Laws Before the vote, state Representative Giovanni Capriglione said to the chamber that the bill was a “pivotal moment in securing Texas’s leadership in the digital age with the passage of our strategic Bitcoin reserve. Now, we embrace a modern asset with traditional properties for future promise.” The bill passed in the Texas Senate in a 25-5 vote on March 6.

Dogecoin (DOGE) performed strongly on Wednesday, continuing the May rally. The token rose to $0.2375, up 8% in the last 24 hours. This movement was driven by a combination of factors, including broader market momentum and bullish technical signals. For one, technicals flashed positive signals, with Dogecoin’s price forming a bullish flag pattern . Specifically, this is when a price rises sharply, following a consolidation near the top. This typically indicates that a breakout is coming.

In Krueger’s view, each phase involves major financial shocks—from a failed U.S. Treasury auction to a new Bretton Woods–style summit—that together would drive a parabolic Bitcoin rally. Krueger’s outline breaks down into sequential “phases,” each building toward the rally. In summary: Phase I: A $200 billion U.S. Treasury auction fails, prompting the Fed to signal “extraordinary measures.” In this environment, Bitcoin briefly jumps (from $158k to $165k) and gold hits $4,200. Simultaneously, BRICS countries establish an independent payment network using gold and Bitcoin. Phase II: A major U.S. pension fund defaults on obligations. The Fed imposes yield curve control , capping 10-year yields at 6.5%, and the dollar weakens sharply. Under these conditions, Krueger projects Bitcoin at $215,000, oil around $122, and gold about $5,800. (He also notes Germany pledges to back the euro with new gold reserves.) Phase III: U.S. home prices plunge 35% and 10-year Treasury yields spike above 8.5%. Bitcoin surges to about $390,000 in this turmoil while gold reaches $8,900. Each of these phases is meant to stoke a flight to alternative assets. For example, in Phase I, Bitcoin and gold initially rise on the chaos, and by Phase III, soaring yields and housing losses further erode confidence in fiat. All dollar figures above are Krueger’s estimates for that stage. Corporate Moves and Currency Restructuring Krueger’s final phases bring in corporate buyers and a full currency reset: Phase IV: Major tech giants (Apple, Tesla, Google) “convert their balance sheets to Bitcoin.” Apple alone accumulates 200,000 BTC. Latin American governments also turn to crypto. Meanwhile, the IMF announces a new global reserve basket (50% Bitcoin, 30% gold, 10% yuan, 10% other) and the Bank of England issues Bitcoin-backed bonds. By this point, Bitcoin exceeds $525,000. Phase V: A “New Bretton Woods” summit in Geneva restructures the U.S. dollar. The dollar gains 25% Bitcoin and 25% gold collateral , and the Fed launches a digital dollar (CBDC), expanding its balance sheet to $44 trillion. In this finale, Bitcoin reaches $600,000, gold $10,400, and oil $180 per barrel. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) drops to the high 60s. In other words, Krueger foresees an unprecedented reshuffling: global reserve currencies realign around BTC and gold. His scenario explicitly puts the dollar index around 68 and projects the S&P 500 roughly halving (a 50% drop from current levels). Krueger’s scenario is highly controversial. It depends on a chain of severe crises that have not occurred. The “$600K prediction” is still viewed as speculative and even “controversial”. Nonetheless, it has sparked discussion online about what market or policy events could set off the proposed rally. Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory For context, Bitcoin price has indeed been rallying in mid-2025. After briefly dipping to just above $100,000 in mid-May, BTC quickly rebounded above $103,000. BTC/USDT Price Chart| Source: TradingView By May 21, it traded around $107–108K, a 14% gain since the start of May. In this rally, the total crypto market capitalization climbed past $3.36 trillion. Despite these gains, Bitcoin remains below its January 2025 all-time high ($109,000). Traders note that the uptrend has formed a bullish flag pattern, with key resistance in the $112k—$120k range. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is $108,352, having climbed 3% over the last 24 hours. It has a trading volume of $67 billion. The market is also digesting macro factors (Fed policy, tariffs, etc.) that could fuel or cap the rally. In short, Bitcoin’s current momentum is strong, but many analysts view further moves as contingent on traditional-market dynamics. PHASE V: THE RESET (Week 12–13) Monday, October 6 U.S. declares emergency “New Bretton Woods” summit in Geneva.

The major breakthrough seems to have been caused by a rise in adoption. With this, the star token has become a $2 trillion asset, as the first price discovery correction after the first price discovery uptrend seems to have completed. The BTC price has confirmed a breakout above the final resistance below the ATH, and hence, the current discovery phase is expected to prevail for a long time. In times when retail traders remain uncertain about the next Bitcoin move, the whales are extremely confident. As per some reports, the 40X BTC whale, James Wynn, has just increased his long position to $1 billion. The Wynn’s conviction looks fueled by record BTC ETF inflows, a wave of profitable holders and relentless bullish chatter. With this, the Open interest (OI) has marked a new ATH, rising by $13 billion on Binance. The rise in the open interest suggests a rise in the total number of outstanding Bitcoin futures or options contracts. This also indicates a rise in the liquidity and volatility within the markets. The BTC price underwent a V-shaped recovery and surged above the final resistance zone, which has pushed the price into the discovery phase. The BTC price just surged above the final resistance level while the 50/200-day MAs is heading towards a bullish crossover or Golden Cross. On the other hand, the +Di & -Di were heading for a bearish crossover, but the latest rise in the price has triggered a bullish divergence. This validates the beginning of a fresh ascending trend, which could keep the price within the discovery phase for a long time. The Bitcoin price has broken its all-time high after 121 days and has also set records in its market capitalization and realized cap. Considering the above chart, the next BTC price high could be somewhere around $119,000.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-smashes-a-new-ath-close-to-110k-heres-whats-next-for-btc-price-rally/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|BNB","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

After breaking through key resistance levels at $0.725 and $0.732, Cardano ( ADA ) is now testing the $0.76 zone, with bullish momentum supported by a MACD crossover and reclaiming of the 50-EMA, according to crypto.news data . Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to an all-time high , which could significantly drive Cardano’s price, especially with its recent integration of Bitcoin support through its Lace wallet. This move enables BTC storage and interaction on Cardano, marking a major step in the project’s multichain strategy and unlocking new DeFi use cases. Investor confidence is also reflected in the nearly $1 billion in ADA withdrawn from centralized exchanges since early 2025, a pattern reminiscent of the lead-up to ADA’s all-time high in 2021.

2025-05-21T17:19:16.000Z,"Solana ETF Discussions Continue as Bitcoin Solaris Offers ‘Bitcoin Ground Floor’ Investment Potential","As crypto markets stir with Discussions of a potential Solana ETF, excitement is high—but so are the prices. While institutional investors shift their focus to top-tier blockchains, retail investors are asking a different question: where is the next true ground floor opportunity? Enter Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), the project that might offer investors exactly that—a second shot at early-Bitcoin-style wealth. Solana’s Momentum, But Not Its Price Point Solana continues to dominate headlines, especially with ongoing talks of a Solana ETF. Its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low costs have made it a favorite among developers and traders alike. However, Solana’s success comes with a price—literally. Many retail investors missed the early wave, and now, with institutions circling, the room for explosive growth may be limited for the average buyer. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris is carving out a new path for wealth creation, one that’s open, accessible, and still incredibly early. The Rise of Bitcoin Solaris Bitcoin Solaris has entered the scene with powerfully efficient architecture, pairing Bitcoin’s legendary Proof-of-Work security with Delegated Proof-of-Stake to enable next-generation speed and scale. Key blockchain features: 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) 2-second finality 99.95% less energy consumption than Bitcoin Dual consensus (PoW + DPoS) This hybrid design solves the blockchain trilemma—achieving security, decentralization, and scalability in a single network. But the true magic of Bitcoin Solaris lies in its ability to empower everyday users, not just developers or institutions. ‘Bitcoin Ground Floor’ Potential — In Your Pocket Imagine mining a next-generation crypto not with bulky rigs, but with a smartphone. Bitcoin Solaris is making that real. With its Solaris Nova App (currently in beta access for selected community members), users can mine BTC-S with: Smartphones (iOS/Android) Laptops and desktop PCs Traditional mining hardware (ASICs/GPUs) No technical knowledge?

Presale Phase 4 – Last Call Before Liftoff Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% The BTC-S presale is in its fourth phase, with early momentum reaching new highs. Already over $1,000,000 has been raised and more than 8,900 unique users have joined the movement. This 90-day presale ends on July 31, 2025, leaving only a narrow window to enter what many are calling the next Bitcoin-style opportunity. With a potential return of 1,900%, this is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market today. What the Crypto World Is Saying The buzz is real. Crypto influencers are paying attention—and for good reason. In a recent breakdown, Crypto Nitro explained why Bitcoin Solaris is one of the most promising projects in the space right now. With its combination of affordability, functionality, and accessibility, it’s quickly becoming the talk of multiple communities. Even platforms like Telegram and X are seeing surges in user activity as more investors begin to take notice. Audited and KYC-Verified Of course, safety and trust matter too. Bitcoin Solaris has been fully audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and the team behind the project has also passed KYC verification . It’s the kind of transparency serious investors demand—and Bitcoin Solaris delivers it without compromise. Conclusion As Solana ETF buzz grows, smart investors are turning to Bitcoin Solaris for what’s next. With mobile mining, fast transactions, and clean energy, BTC-S offers a powerful all-in-one crypto experience. More importantly, it’s still early.

2025-05-21T17:07:47.000Z,"Who Owns the Most Bitcoin?","The question of who owns the most Bitcoin is both simple and deeply complex. At the surface, blockchain transparency means anyone can see the largest wallets. But behind those cryptographic addresses lie a mix of anonymous creators, corporate giants, governments, and investment funds whose collective holdings shape the fate of the world’s first and most valuable cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin's King: Satoshi Nakamoto At the top of every list sits a name shrouded in mystery: Satoshi Nakamoto. Widely recognized as the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Nakamoto is estimated to hold between 1 million and 1.1 million BTC, making him the single largest holder of the cryptocurrency by a significant margin. These coins were mined in Bitcoin’s earliest days, spread across thousands of addresses, and have remained untouched since Nakamoto’s disappearance from public life in 2010. This immense fortune, worth over $68 billion at May 2024 prices has never been moved, spent, or sold. As a result, many analysts consider these coins effectively “out of circulation.” If even a fraction of Nakamoto’s stash were to move, it would send shockwaves through the market, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s price and investor sentiment. Institutional Titans: ETFs and BlackRock While Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings remain frozen, a new class of Bitcoin giants has emerged: institutional investment vehicles, particularly exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In 2024, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States fundamentally changed the landscape of Bitcoin ownership. By May 2025, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively held over 1.1 million BTC surpassing even Nakamoto’s legendary stash and accounting for more than 5% of all Bitcoin in existence. The largest among them is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which alone controls over 636,000 BTC, making it the second-largest single holder after Nakamoto and the largest institutional holder. IBIT’s meteoric rise has been fueled by surging demand from both retail and institutional investors seeking regulated, mainstream exposure to Bitcoin. ETF analysts suggest that if this trend continues, IBIT could soon eclipse even Nakamoto’s holdings, especially if Bitcoin’s price approaches new highs and institutional inflows accelerate. Binance and the Power of Custody Crypto exchanges are another major force in the Bitcoin ownership hierarchy. Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, holds between 633,000 and 647,000 BTC in custodial wallets as of 2025. While these assets technically belong to millions of users, the concentration of such a vast amount of Bitcoin under a single entity’s control gives exchanges like Binance enormous influence over market liquidity and stability. Other exchanges, such as Bitfinex and Kraken, also feature among the top holders, each managing hundreds of thousands of BTC on behalf of their users. Corporate Whales: MicroStrategy and Beyond MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin accumulation. As of 2025, the company holds between 214,000 and 244,800 BTC by far the largest treasury of any public company. Saylor himself is a notable individual holder, reportedly owning over 17,000 BTC personally. MicroStrategy’s aggressive strategy — raising capital to buy more Bitcoin has inspired other corporations to follow suit, including Tesla, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Block.one. These corporate actions have contributed to Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as a treasury asset and hedge against inflation. Governments: From Seizures to Strategic Holdings Governments have also become significant Bitcoin holders, primarily through law enforcement seizures. The U.S. government, following high-profile confiscations from criminal cases such as Silk Road and Bitfinex, now controls over 205,000 BTC. China, despite its ban on crypto trading, reportedly holds around 194,000 BTC seized from various operations. Bulgaria is another surprising entrant, with reports suggesting it holds over 213,000 BTC potentially making it one of the world’s largest sovereign holders, though the status of these coins remains unclear. The Early Adopters and Individual Whales A handful of early adopters and investors have also amassed legendary fortunes. The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, are estimated to hold around 70,000 BTC each, stemming from their early belief in Bitcoin’s potential. Venture capitalist Tim Draper famously bought 30,000 BTC at a U.S. government auction in 2014 and is believed to have added to his position since. Other so-called “whales”: individuals or entities holding more than 1,000 BTC make up a significant but opaque portion of the market. Many of these early miners and anonymous investors have never revealed their identities, and their coins often remain dormant for years. Why Does It Matter Who Owns the Most Bitcoin? The distribution of Bitcoin ownership has profound implications for the market: Large holders often called “whales” can move markets with a single transaction. Their buying or selling decisions can trigger price swings, impacting retail investors and institutional portfolios alike. The presence of long-term holders, such as Satoshi and early miners, whose coins remain untouched, is often seen as a sign of confidence in Bitcoin’s future. The rise of ETFs and corporate treasuries signals growing mainstream acceptance, potentially stabilizing Bitcoin’s price and broadening its investor base. While blockchain data makes it possible to track large wallets, the true identity behind many addresses remains unknown, adding an element of intrigue and risk to the market. Conclusion Bitcoin’s ownership is more concentrated than many realize, with a handful of entities: some anonymous, some corporate, some governmental controlling vast portions of the total supply. As institutional adoption accelerates and regulatory frameworks evolve, the list of top holders will continue to shift. Yet, for now, Satoshi Nakamoto’s untouched fortune remains the stuff of legend, a silent testament to Bitcoin’s origins and the enduring mystery at the heart of the world’s most valuable digital asset.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9216/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T17:07:41.000Z,"Binance enables PIX payments in Brazil using cryptocurrencies","Exchange Binance revealed the integration of Brazil’s PIX system with its cryptocurrency platform, allowing users to make payments in the local currency (BRL) using digital assets, such as Bitcoin, in real time. According to local media outlet E Investidor, this means that people and businesses all over Brazil can be paid by Binance users through PIX , the national instant payment system. With this integration, those with a Binance account can convert their crypto balance into BRL in an instant, practically facilitating instantaneous transactions. This is a significant step towards integrating traditional financial and digital assets within Latin America’s largest economy. From Bitcoin to everyday purchases This service allows Binance users in Brazil to pay for a variety of common items, like groceries, gas, school fees, and coffee, directly using cryptocurrency. The transaction procedure automatically converts the selected crypto asset into Brazilian real (1 Real = 0.18 US dollar) at the time of payment, eliminating the need for pre-conversion or third-party services. The move aims to make it easier to employ cryptocurrency in practical, real-world applications. By connecting Binance’s crypto ecosystem to the national payments infrastructure, the exchange hopes to increase the adoption of digital currencies in the region. “The integration is a simple and inclusive way to bring cryptocurrencies into everyday use, from coffee to school bills, from gas to groceries,” said Guilherme Nazar, Binance’s Regional VP for Latin America. Strategic expansion in Latin America The launch marks a continuation of Binance’s efforts to expand its foothold in Latin America, a region that is witnessing rapid growth in the crypto sector. Brazil, above all, has become a target market due to its large population, already existing fintech industry, and crypto-friendly ecosystem. The company is stressing the inclusive nature of this integration, calling it a catalyst for financial inclusion. With PIX being adopted by more than 140 million Brazilians, the integration of this system with the Binance platform starts to facilitate access to digital currencies for the population. According to Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, “this synergy empowers users with real-time and hassle-free transactions, enhancing the cryptocurrency experience and driving financial inclusion to new heights.” Regulatory considerations remain unclear Despite technological development, regulatory clarity is still a work in progress. Brazil’s Central Bank has recommended designating cryptocurrency exchanges for real as foreign exchange operations. If implemented, this classification would result in the imposition of the Tax on Financial Transactions (IOF), which applies to traditional currency exchanges. This possible taxing scheme is currently subject to public consultation, and no final decision has been made. As a result, it is unclear if consumers converting cryptocurrency to Brazil’s real for ordinary purchases may face additional taxes under the new classification. Boosting financial inclusion through innovation Binance is touting it as a key step toward improving financial inclusion. Integrating PIX with cryptocurrency payments will introduce users to digital finance and break technical and transactional barriers, regardless of banking status, they added. This innovation could do wonders in a country where millions are still underbanked or unbanked by traditional banks. Having crypto as a direct method of payment through a more widely used system like PIX would create an intersection between digital assets and everyday financial needs. Looking ahead While the entire significance of the move will rely on legal developments and user uptake, Binance’s PIX integration is a clear indication of the company’s desire to integrate cryptocurrencies deeper into Brazilians’ daily financial lives. Binance is seeking to transform digital currency from a speculative asset to a useful tool for daily transactions by integrating a global exchange platform with a national payment system. As the legal framework evolves, the success of this project could establish a precedent for other countries looking to integrate cryptocurrency into their existing financial institutions. For the time being, Binance sees Brazil as a testing ground for the future of real-time cryptocurrency payments.

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways : Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals. The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops. Bitcoin ( BTC ) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly. Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up. Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: Glassnode However, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations . So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession? Bitcoin cycle top markers Several technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak. The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely. The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in. Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend. BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, Glassnode Additionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum. BTC/USD 1-day, OBV. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingView Profit-taking metrics As market cycle tops approach, long-term holders and Bitcoin miners often start locking in profits. Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows. The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops. Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, Glassnode Individually, these indicators can mark various shifts in market trends. Combined, they often align with cycle tops. Related: Sorry bears — Bitcoin analysis dismisses $107K BTC price double top The 15% rule Historic price activity observations might come in handy, too. Crypto market analyst Cole Garner shared his exit playbook based on whales’ behavior. His roadmap includes three steps: Euphoria. Bitcoin moves vertically for weeks, with massive $10,000+ daily candles. Whiplash. Bitcoin experiences its sharpest correction of the bull cycle. The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer. Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point. According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well. Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems. Source: Cole Garner No single indicator can pinpoint the exact moment to exit, especially in a shifting macro environment. But when multiple signals align, they become hard to ignore. The final leg of a Bitcoin bull market is thrilling, but knowing when the music might stop is key to locking in profits.

PEPE’s $10M profit boosted his reputation and sparked concerns over his strategy. With nearly $1B in Bitcoin, Wynn’s high leverage and risky trades could lead to his downfall. James Wynn is known in the crypto world mostly for his uncommon trading methods and risky approaches. Lucky has now claimed that Wynn’s introduction to cryptocurrency occurred when Alameda funded his wallet in 2022. After that, Wynn gained recognition for his aggressive actions. However, his behaviour has now sparked concerns in the industry. Wynn’s most significant breakthrough came when he found the PEPE token. At the beginning, the token’s market value was quite small. Yet, the company’s strategy played a key role in raising the market cap to $4.2 million, which resulted in declared earnings of $10 million. Even though his notoriety grew, some people worried about his growing risk when trading.

2025-05-21T16:55:03.000Z,"Trump Economist Says US Debt the ‘Safest Bet on Earth,’ Calls Moody’s Downgrade Backward-Looking","White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett doesn’t agree with Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating. Hassett says in a new interview with Fox Business that US debt “is the safest bet on Earth.” “There’s no country’s debt that I’d rather have than the United States’, and so Moody’s can do what it wants to. As Secretary Bessent said, it’s a backward-looking thing, penalizing us for all the reckless spending of the Biden Administration. But we’re cutting spending, we’re deregulating, we’ve got supply-side growth, and so we’ve got every reason in the world to believe that we’re going to have the best economy on Earth. And if you have the best economy on Earth, you’re going to have the best debt on Earth too.” Moody’s downgraded America’s credit rating from AAA to AA1 while changing the country’s outlook from negative to stable. The credit rating agency cited the United States’ soaring national debt and interest payment ratios that exceed those of other countries with the same credit rating. The decision stripped the US of its final Triple-A credit rating: in 2011, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) lowered the US rating from AAA to AA+ due to concerns over the government’s inability to address rising debt levels. In 2023, Fitch Ratings followed suit, citing persistent budget deficits and political infighting as key drivers of the downgrade.

Data from Hyperliquid dashboard, HyperDash , reveals that the trader currently holds over $15 million in unrealized gains, with their exposure primarily split between Bitcoin and the meme coin PEPE. Whale Trader Bets Big on Bitcoin and PEPE Amid Market Shift The Bitcoin ($BTC) allocation alone is worth approximately $193,773,551, acquired at an average entry price just under $105,000. At present, Bitcoin is trading above $106,600 — marking a 1.5% daily increase and placing it roughly 2% shy of its all-time high. The trader has employed 3.78x leverage, with margin usage slightly at 13.61%. In contrast, Ethereum has dipped to $2,492, recording a 2% decline over the last 24 hours, while other major altcoins such as XRP, BNB, and Solana remain relatively flat.

Pepe’s Charts Look Greener than the Frog Himself On the price chart below, Pepe is showing continued strength after a massive weekend rally, with price action consolidating just below the recent local high. Whale accumulation between Thursday and Saturday sent the token soaring by 78% in just two days, triggering a breakout from a long-standing descending wedge. That explosive move pushed PEPE into a steep uptrend — one that’s now pausing for breath. The RSI has cooled slightly from overbought levels and is currently sitting around 66.87, suggesting the market is digesting gains without triggering heavy selling pressure. PEPE has added another 11.4% in the past 24 hours and is now trading 82% higher than it was this time last month — with most of those gains concentrated in the recent breakout. If momentum continues and bulls maintain control, PEPE could climb past $0.000025 to set a new six-month high — opening the door for a run toward its previous all-time high above $0.000028.

At the same time, BNB Chain’s business and trading hub, THENA, prepares for its V3,3 upgrade, scheduled to go live tomorrow, May 22. The upcoming upgrade aims to transform how governance, rewards, and liquidity operate in decentralized finance (DeFi). THENA @ThenaFi_ · Follow 1/ THENA is about to go through its biggest upgrade yet. V3,3 will be live with new UI and voting later tonight.It brings modularity, automated rewards, and custom strategies. Built for capital efficiency with all stakeholders in mind.Read our blog or the thread below to 4:03 PM · May 21, 2025 122 Reply Copy link Read 15 replies Amidst bullish ecosystem developments, attention has shifted to charts. One analyst highlighted possible THE/USD bullish reversals. Notably, the alt has secured reliable support at $0.21 – $0.24 on the 4H chart after extended declines. A rebound from this foothold could propel THE to the target of $0.68, translating to an approximately 120% surge from current prices of $0.3105. THENA’s V3.3 upgrade: what’s new? THENA is a BNB Chain-based liquidity layer and DEX that offers perpetual and spot trading for various assets. THE Liquidity Marketplace, which utilizes the ve(3,3) model, is at the center of the THENA ecosystem. With the latest upgrade, THENA aims to transform DeFi governance and liquidity management, aligning with its goal of a modular and self-optimized network. The announcement indicated: “With V3,3, THENA becomes faster, more agile, and more flexible than ever. From governance to liquidity provision (LP) mechanics, the system is primed for long-term scalability and sustainability.” Meanwhile, the update introduces Plugins – modular smart contract features that allow liquidity pools to fine-tune dynamically depending on prevailing market conditions. The Plugins include volatility-linked fees that adjust based on market movements and sliding fee scales, offering a supple pricing model. Moreover, users can brace for the upcoming Brevis ZK Plugin that leverages zk (zero-knowledge) proofs to offer fee discounts based on user identity. The Plugins resemble Uniswap’s “hooks,” which launched with the V4 upgrade early this year . Furthermore, THENA’s V3.3 upgrade launched a Unified Gauge System. The update enables manual CLPs (concentrated liquidity providers) to stake non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and earn THE rewards. THE price outlook: Is a 120% move impending? The native token appears ripe for bullish breakouts as the blockchain prepares for the key upgrade. THE changes hands at $0.3105, ready for an explosive surge. Crypto trader James Melville shared a 4H THE/USDT price chart highlighting a persistent decline from late 2024. Source – James Melville on X That saw the alt plummeting from $5 with lower lows and lower highs inside a descending channel. Nevertheless, the latest price action indicates a possible momentum shift to the upside. THENA has secured a reliable support floor at the $0.21 – $0.24 range. The alt has tested this level several times, and buyers have joined to defend it every time. THE’s current price of $0.3105 places it inside the descending trendline, with consolidation signaling possible bullish breakouts. Breaching the trendline resistance might trigger rallies to the chart’s target of $0.68, a 119% gain from current prices. However, the $0.21 support remains vital for THE/USD. Losing this barrier will cancel the bullish pattern and welcome bearish price actions. The current market sentiments, as Bitcoin eyes a closing above $110K, support THENA’s bullish trajectory.

Fortune, citing four anonymous banking and private equity executives, reports that Circle wants at least $5 billion for a sale. The USDC issuer has been gearing up for an initial public offering (IPO), but the firm would reportedly scuttle those plans should an acquisition materialize. The stablecoin giant filed an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month. Circle initially announced plans to go public back in 2021, via a merger with Concord Acquisition Corp, a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Those plans were called off in December 2022. Circle and Coinbase already have a long history: The firms co-created USDC in 2018 and jointly managed the asset through the Centre Consortium until 2023. That year, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire announced that his company would bring all of USDC’s governance and operations responsibilities in-house to streamline management of the stablecoin. Coinbase said at the time that it would purchase an equity stake in Circle, and the stablecoin issuer’s April S-1 registration statement indicates the top US crypto exchange receives revenue generated from USDC reserves. Coinbase became a public company in April 2021. Ripple already submitted an offer to purchase Circle with a bid of $4-5 billion, but the stablecoin issuer rejected the number, Fortune reports.

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways:Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewProfit-taking metricsAs market cycle tops approach, long-term holders and Bitcoin miners often start locking in profits. Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeIndividually, these indicators can mark various shifts in market trends. Combined, they often align with cycle tops.Related: Sorry bears — Bitcoin analysis dismisses $107K BTC price double topThe 15% ruleHistoric price activity observations might come in handy, too. Crypto market analyst Cole Garner shared his exit playbook based on whales’ behavior. His roadmap includes three steps:Euphoria. Bitcoin moves vertically for weeks, with massive $10,000+ daily candles.Whiplash. Bitcoin experiences its sharpest correction of the bull cycle. The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems. Source: Cole GarnerNo single indicator can pinpoint the exact moment to exit, especially in a shifting macro environment. But when multiple signals align, they become hard to ignore.

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.The banking lobby says that if stablecoins pay interest or any other type of monetary reward, banks will be “harmed,” Campbell added.An excerpt of Campbell’s X post.

In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‘address poisoning’ attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence. That’s what institutions have been waiting for,” Grachev told Cointelegraph during the Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on May 20, adding:“Stablecoins aren’t a crypto experiment anymore. They’re a better form of money. Faster, simpler, and more transparent than fiat.

Monthly remittances typically range from $131 to $648, representing between 6% and 23% of the sender’s average income.“Remittances are lifelines in this region, but they’re broken,” Lapchik told Cointelegraph. “Guatemala alone sees $21 billion in remittances every year, and families are losing 6% to 10% of that to fees and delays. These are people sending $300, $400 a month, and they can’t afford to wait days or pay that much just to get money home,” he said, adding:“Crypto solves this when it’s used the right way. It lets us move money instantly and at a fraction of the cost, integrated into the bank apps people already use.” Latin America is the second-fastest growing region in terms of crypto adoption, though Guatemala lags behind regional leaders Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, according to a 2024 Chainalysis study.The study cited stablecoins as a primary adoption driver in the region. Crypto adoption in Latin America by total value received.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders.

The platform will be powered by Maia, an AI core engine developed by My Aion, and aims to optimize and manage systems across mobility, energy, education, healthcare and digital services. My Aion CEO Daniele Marinelli said the AI will know the user well enough to “recommend the perfect place for your anniversary dinner and book it for you without you lifting a finger.”The project will debut in Abu Dhabi before expanding internationally. It is expected to launch in 18 months. Multibillion-dollar AI project to create jobs for UAE nationalsThe project is structured under a $2.5 billion Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, a public-private partnership model for large-scale infrastructure and technology projects. Under the model, private sector entities construct the infrastructure, run and manage the system for a certain period. The companies usually recoup their investments and earn profits during the operational phase. At the end of the period set by the parties involved, ownership and control of the systems developed through the BOT model are transferred to the government or a public sector entity. Bold Technologies CEO Thani Al Thani Al Falasi said the initiative will support UAE job creation. “This initiative will support job creation for UAE nationals, foster local innovation and contribute meaningfully to the national AI ecosystem,” he said. My Aion’s Marinelli said that relocating to Abu Dhabi provides their global operations with a new chapter. “The UAE offers the infrastructure and institutional support needed to scale responsibly and strategically,” Marinelli said.Cointelegraph has reached out to Bold Technologies and My Aion for more information. Related: Decentralized OORT AI data hits top ranks on Google KaggleCrypto proponents say AI could benefit from digital assetsOn May 20, Catena Labs, a project led by Circle co-founder Sean Neville, announced that it will create an AI-native financial institution.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case. In August 2024, NFT trading platform OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC, alleging that NFTs traded on the marketplace could qualify as unregistered securities. On Feb. 22, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the SEC has officially closed its investigation into the platform. The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries. The lawyers urged the SEC to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws.”Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-royalties-not-securities-sec-peirce?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T08:27:53.000Z,"South Korea tightens crypto rules ahead of institutional market entry","South Korea is tightening rules around digital asset transactions as it prepares to allow institutional players into its crypto market, introducing new guidelines for nonprofit crypto sales and stricter listing standards for exchanges.On May 20, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea said during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting that it had finalized sweeping new measures.Set to take effect in June, the updated rules allow both nonprofit organizations and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies, but under new compliance standards.Nonprofit entities must have at least five years of audited financial history to be permitted to receive and sell virtual asset donations. They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations. Source: FSCRelated: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFsExchange sales to be restrictedCrypto exchanges will be allowed to liquidate user fees paid in crypto, but only to cover operational costs. Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors.Cointelegraph contacted South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cardsSouth Korean candidates push pro-crypto agendaSouth Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, aiming to curb capital flight and bolster the country’s financial autonomy.Speaking at a recent policy forum, Lee said a won-based stablecoin could help retain domestic wealth and reduce dependence on foreign-backed digital currencies such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC).The initiative is part of Lee’s broader push for digital asset reforms, which also includes legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party, has also expressed support for introducing spot crypto ETFs, signaling bipartisan momentum on the issue.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-tightens-kyc-rules-ahead-of-institutional-crypto-entry?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC. There is little doubt that institutional buying remains the primary catalyst for Bitcoin to break above the $108,000 level. Such a move would trigger the liquidation of heavily leveraged bearish positions, likely accelerating the push to a new all-time high. However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation.

Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.”India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators.
