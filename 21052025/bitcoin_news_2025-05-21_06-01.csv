2025-05-21T03:00:47.000Z,"Could Bitcoin’s Strength Boost MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano Toward 1,000x Territory?","Introduction As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to set the tone for the 2025 bull market, investors are pivoting to altcoins that could deliver outsized returns. While BTC commands institutional dominance, many traders believe the real upside lies in smaller-cap assets that benefit from its momentum. That’s why tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE , XRP , and Cardano (ADA) are dominating current watchlists. With fresh inflows, expanding narratives, and key technical setups, these three may be best positioned to push toward the elusive 1,000x tier before the year ends. Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) round out the group with steady performance and ecosystem strength—but the spotlight is clearly shifting toward early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Bitcoin’s Surge: The Market Catalyst Bitcoin’s latest rally is driven by global economic uncertainty, institutional adoption, and regulatory clarity. Moody’s US credit downgrade and major banks enabling Bitcoin purchases have strengthened its narrative as a macro hedge, attracting both retail and institutional capital. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, it often triggers a “trickle-down” effect: capital first flows into BTC, then rotates into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Exponential Potential or Hype? MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout among early-stage altcoins. With over $8 million raised and a presale price under $0.001, analysts project potential returns ranging from 35x to as high as 18,500% (185x), with some even suggesting a $1 target by year-end 2025—though this would require a meteoric rise. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics (100 billion cap, 45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and viral meme appeal are fueling rapid community growth and investor interest. Conservative analyst targets: 35x–50x returns Aggressive projections: Up to 185x, with $1 as a “stretch” target Key drivers: Early entry, scarcity, community momentum XRP Prepares for Institutional Access XRP continues to trade above $2.30 , supported by speculation around CME Futures and potential ETF developments. With global settlement infrastructure already in place, and regulatory clarity opening the doors to institutions, XRP is being revalued by investors aiming for long-term growth. Price targets as high as $10–$15 are being floated as adoption expands. Cardano Shows Quiet Strength With Rebuilding Momentum Cardano (ADA) remains one of the most resilient Layer-1s, and recent upticks in smart contract deployment and active wallet usage are catching attention. While its pace is slower than peers, ADA is regaining confidence as a stable growth play—and some are looking at it as an undervalued opportunity heading into summer. Ethereum Anchors Portfolios With ETF Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is holding near $2,700 , bolstered by anticipation of spot ETF approval and strong Layer-2 expansion. While not as high-risk as other altcoins, ETH continues to provide solid upside potential for portfolios seeking stability in a rapidly evolving market. Cosmos (ATOM) Builds Developer Engagement Cosmos (ATOM) is seeing renewed developer activity and ecosystem interest. With cross-chain infrastructure gaining traction, ATOM may be one of the more underrated projects quietly building momentum behind the scenes. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s strength is creating the conditions for the next round of high-return altcoin plays. While XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum offer layered value, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that currently holds the greatest potential for exponential returns . As early entry narrows and capital flows accelerate, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most explosive opportunity of 2025.

2025-05-21T03:00:41.000Z,"Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say","An analyst has explained what some charts related to Bitcoin could say regarding whether the current run can lead to a new high or not. Bitcoin Momentum May Be Stalling According To These Signs In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about some technical analysis (TA) signs that could reveal if it’s time for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says Here are the charts that the analyst has shared: The first graph shows a TA pattern that Bitcoin has potentially been trading inside for the last few months. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel,” which emerges whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. There are different types of Parallel Channels, but in the context of the current topic, the most ordinary version is of interest: the one with the channel parallel to the time-axis. This case naturally corresponds to a completely sideways movement from the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it’s visible that BTC has recently observed a rise to the upper line of the pattern. During previous retests, the coin ended up finding rejection at this mark. Thus, it’s possible that it may also face resistance here during the current retest. This isn’t the only trend that could make a break to the ATH a tricky one. As is visible from the second graph, the RSI has shown divergence from the Bitcoin price recently. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the speed and magnitude of changes that the asset’s price has witnessed recently. This metric is generally used for judging overpriced and underpriced conditions for the token. BTC’s RSI formed a peak in the overbought region earlier in the month, but while the price has gone up since then, the indicator has only managed to form a smaller peak. This type of divergence between the asset and the RSI is often considered to be a bearish signal. Lastly, there is also a bearish development in the MACD, displayed in the third chart. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is another TA indicator that’s used for gauging momentum. It involves two lines: the MACD line calculated by taking the difference between the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of the price and the signal line determined as the 9-day EMA of the MACD line. Recently, the MACD line for Bitcoin has dipped under the signal line, which is usually considered as a bearish crossover. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $103,000 Relatively Cool Per This Indicator, Quant Says Based on all these patterns, Martinez has noted that momentum is stalling for BTC. It now remains to be seen how the asset would develop in the coming days and if a reversal to the downside would happen.

2025-05-21T02:29:53.000Z,"Chart Decoder Series: RSI – Công Cụ Soi Đường Trong Thị Trường Quá Mua/Quá Bán","Chào bạn quay lại với Series Giải Mã Chart , nơi chúng ta biến những con số khô khan thành các tín hiệu dễ hiểu, giúp bạn hành động đúng lúc và đúng chỗ! Ở bài trước, chúng ta đã khám phá cách MACD giúp bắt kịp đà tăng sớm. Hôm nay, hãy cùng tìm hiểu một công cụ được lòng trader nhất để hoàn thiện kỹ năng bắt trend thị trường: RSI – người bạn đồng hành không thể thiếu trong mọi giao dịch! RSI Là Gì? RSI (Relative Strength Index) – hay còn gọi là Kim Chỉ Nam Tâm Lý Thị Trường – là một công cụ đơn giản nhưng cực kỳ mạnh mẽ. Nó giúp bạn biết liệu thị trường đang quá hưng phấn (quá mua ) hay quá chán nản (quá bán ). Khác với các chỉ báo chạy theo giá, RSI đo lường áp lực mua/bán dựa trên biến động gần đây. Điều này giống như việc bạn có một chiếc radar phát hiện tâm lý đám đông trước khi thị trường lật kèo vậy! Giải Mã RSI Theo Cách Dễ Hiểu Nhất: ● RSI trên 70 = Quá Mua → Thị trường có thể sắp hạ nhiệt ● RSI dưới 30 = Quá Bán → Thị trường có thể sắp bật dậy ● RSI giữa 40–60 = Trạng thái Chill → Chưa có tín hiệu gì hot! Ví dụ đơn giản: RSI (Bảng Màu Tím): Cảnh Báo “Quá Mua” Trong biểu đồ trên, RSI của 14 cây nến gần nhất vượt ngưỡng 70 , báo hiệu trạng thái quá mua cổ điển . Điều này cho thấy đợt tăng giá gần đây của BTC có thể đang mất đà hoặc chuẩn bị bước vào giai đoạn điều chỉnh. Các trader hiện đang quan sát: RSI giảm xuống dưới 70 như dấu hiệu đầu tiên của đảo chiều. Nếu BTC vẫn giữ vững, RSI có thể duy trì trạng thái quá mua – một đặc điểm thường thấy trong xu hướng tăng mạnh (nhưng rủi ro cao cho người mua muộn). RSI càng mạnh mẽ hơn khi kết hợp với các chỉ báo khác. Hãy thử ghép đôi nó với MACD và Đường Trung Bình Động để xác nhận tín hiệu tốt hơn nhé! MACD: Động Lực Tăng Vẫn Còn Nguyên MACD Line (Xanh): 4,142 Signal Line (Cam): 3,536 Histogram: Dương, nhưng các thanh đang dần co lại, cho thấy động lực có thể đang chậm lại. MACD vẫn tích cực với đường xanh nằm thoải mái trên đường cam, nhưng hãy chú ý đến histogram. Nếu các thanh bắt đầu thu hẹp, đó có thể là dấu hiệu rằng động lực tăng đang suy yếu. Đường Trung Bình Động: Liệu BTC Có Quá Mở Rộng? ● 50-Day EMA (Đường Vàng): 92,570 ● 200-Day SMA (Đường Xanh): 91,673 Giá BTC đang giao dịch cao hơn cả hai đường trung bình động chính, xác nhận xu hướng tăng mạnh mẽ. Tuy nhiên, điều này cũng đặt ra vấn đề: Liệu thị trường có đang quá căng? Khi giá kéo xa khỏi các đường này, một đợt điều chỉnh lành mạnh về vùng 50 EMA là điều hoàn toàn có thể xảy ra. Kết Luận Cuối Cùng: Nên Hành Động Ngay Hay Chờ? Xu Hướng Hiện Tại: Mạnh mẽ tăng nhưng có khả năng quá mở rộng. RSI: Trong vùng quá mua, hãy cẩn trọng. MACD: Vẫn tích cực, nhưng cho thấy dấu hiệu ban đầu của việc chậm lại. Chiến Lược: Nếu bạn đã có lợi nhuận, đây là thời điểm tuyệt vời để cân nhắc chốt lời hoặc siết chặt stop-loss. Nếu bạn đang chờ cơ hội vào lệnh, hãy đợi một đợt điều chỉnh về vùng 50 EMA để có điểm vào với tỷ lệ rủi ro/lợi nhuận tốt hơn. Mẹo Pro Sử Dụng RSI Như Một Cao Thủ RSI rất đơn giản, nhưng cách sử dụng nó mới là chìa khóa. Dưới đây là vài bí kíp từ các trader chuyên nghiệp: ● Hiểu Bối Cảnh Thị Trường RSI hoạt động xuất sắc trong thị trường đi ngang (range-bound), nơi giá bật qua lại giữa hỗ trợ và kháng cự. Nhưng trong xu hướng mạnh (như đợt tăng giá), RSI có thể duy trì vùng quá mua/quá bán trong nhiều tuần. Vì vậy, đừng vội bán chỉ vì RSI chạm 70 – hãy nhìn bức tranh lớn hơn.. ● Kết Hợp Với Các Chỉ Báo Khác RSI hoạt động tốt nhất khi có bạn đồng hành. Hãy ghép nó với: ○ MACD để kiểm tra xem động lực có đồng thuận với RSI không. ○ Đường Trung Bình Động (như 50 EMA) để xem giá có bị kéo quá xa khỏi các mức hỗ trợ chính không. ● Quan Sát Phân Kỳ ○ Nếu giá tạo đỉnh mới, nhưng RSI không? Đó là phân kỳ giảm – động lực có thể đang suy yếu. ○ Nếu giá tạo đáy mới, nhưng RSI không? Đó là phân kỳ tăng – một đợt bật lên có thể sắp tới. ○ Phân kỳ không luôn diễn ra ngay lập tức, nhưng đây là một manh mối mà các trader nghiêm túc không bao giờ bỏ qua. ● RSI Là Chỉ Báo Sớm, Không Phải Lệnh Gọi Hành Động Chỉ vì RSI báo hiệu quá mua/quá bán không có nghĩa bạn cần hành động ngay. Hãy coi nó như cảnh báo sớm, không phải lý do để hoảng loạn mua/bán. ● Chơi Với Các Khung Thời Gian Để Tinh Chỉnh Chiến Lược Các chỉ số RSI thay đổi tùy thuộc vào khung thời gian bạn đang xem. ○ Nếu RSI hàng ngày báo hiệu quá mua, nhưng RSI 1 giờ đang hạ nhiệt, điều này thường cho thấy thị trường đang trong đợt điều chỉnh ngắn hạn bên trong xu hướng tăng lớn hơn. ○ Trader thông minh sẽ tận dụng điều này, chờ RSI ngắn hạn reset trước khi nhảy vào xu hướng lớn hơn.

2025-05-21T02:00:45.000Z,"Ethereum’s Revenge: Arthur Hayes Predicts Run To $10,000","In a macro-focused interview with the Bankless podcast, Arthur Hayes, the former BitMEX CEO and current Maelstrom CIO, laid out his bullish thesis on Ethereum, arguing that a move to $10,000 or even $15,000 is a realistic outcome as global liquidity shifts and capital controls take hold in the next monetary regime. Asked why ETH had rallied over 50% in a week, Hayes dismissed technical triggers and pointed instead to sentiment. “The most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle,” he said. “It’s just human nature.” For Hayes, the Ethereum comeback was long overdue after years of being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens. “ETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running… it was time.” Why Ethereum Could Soar To $10,000 Despite not having added to his position, Hayes said he remained long Ethereum and was unfazed by the current price. “It’s great it’s going up, but okay—let’s talk at $10,000 or $15,000. Let’s talk when it’s meaningful.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? Hayes placed Ethereum’s rebound in the broader context of what he calls a global monetary “phase shift”—a transition away from the US Treasury as the world’s reserve asset, toward a bifurcated system where store-of-value flows increasingly shift toward gold and Bitcoin. In this paradigm, Ethereum benefits not just from speculative risk flows, but also from structural changes in how capital moves under increasing financial repression and capital controls. While he reiterated his belief that gold and Bitcoin are the two neutral reserve assets in a politically fractured world, Hayes sees Ethereum as a powerful high-beta trade in the coming wave of liquidity expansion. “They print the money,” he said bluntly. “And the consequence will be gold and Bitcoin going through the roof.” Still, Ethereum’s path won’t be linear. Hayes acknowledged ETH’s underperformance versus Bitcoin so far, but suggested that ETH’s moment is coming—particularly if regulatory clarity improves or if decentralized finance regains traction with sustainable cash flows. He singled out projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that might finally justify valuation through fundamentals. Related Reading: Ethereum Headed For Crucial Encounter At $4,000 – Here’s Why The potential for Ethereum to outperform dramatically remains, Hayes argued, especially as the market continues to digest what he sees as the beginning of the end for the 50-year US Treasury-based global financial system. “If you want to preserve access to capital and spend it how you want, the only things you can own are gold and Bitcoin,” he said. But for the investor with appetite for asymmetry, ETH is “a hard slog” now—yet still in the early stages of what could be a runaway rally. Whether Ethereum reaches the $10,000 mark in 2025 or beyond, Hayes is positioning for that outcome. “Mailstream is about 60% Bitcoin, 20% ETH and then you know a lot of other shitcoins and term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it’s physical gold and gold miners and T bills. That’s it,” Hayes revealed. At press time, ETH traded at $2,477.

2025-05-21T02:00:24.000Z,"What’s the Next Big Move? MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Solana Are Leading the Shift","Introduction As May 2025 unfolds, conviction-driven capital is flowing into a new set of crypto leaders . From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, the spotlight is on four tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Each brings a distinct edge—macro leadership, DeFi infrastructure, early-stage asymmetric potential, and cross-border utility. But for those seeking the biggest ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the most aggressively positioned altcoin in the space. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the top early-stage play of Q2 2025 , with Stage 8 live, over $8 million raised, and a listing target of $0.007. Its scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply and Hashex audit have analysts forecasting 35x–50x returns before listings.MAGA’s blend of viral narrative, transparent tokenomics, and a presale structure attracting both retail and whale capital is fueling unmatched momentum. As Stage 8 accelerates, those entering now are acting on a clear risk-reward model, not just hype. The window for early entry is closing fast, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly ranked as the #1 altcoin presale for 2025. Bitcoin Holds Ground as Institutional Confidence Grows Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $95,000, consolidating after a strong recovery from April lows. Analysts are targeting $104,000–$109,000 as key resistance, with the next leg of the supercycle potentially pushing BTC to $150,000 or higher.As Bitcoin anchors the market, it’s enabling capital to cascade into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the opportunity for exponential gains remains open. Ethereum: Technical Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,356, retreating from its recent high of $2,728 but still up significantly for May. Technical analysis points to a potential retest of $2,600–$2,700 if ETH holds above $2,250, with long-term targets as high as $4,500 by late 2025.As the cornerstone of Web3 and DeFi, Ethereum’s rising institutional interest and rapid Layer 2 adoption continue to bolster its outlook. Solana: Ecosystem Growth Drives Major Momentum Solana (SOL) is trading at $162.08, reflecting a modest pullback after recent highs near $183. For May 2025, the expected trading range is $158–$175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 resistance. Solana’s positive trend remains supported by DeFi growth, Web3 participation, and strong investor confidence. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Utility and Cross-Border Reach Stellar Lumens (XLM) is quietly gaining traction as a cross-border payments leader. While not as headline-grabbing as BTC or ETH, XLM’s consistent utility and adoption make it a favorite for those seeking stable, long-term growth.As capital rotates, some XLM holders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, early-stage upside. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion The smart money in May 2025 is moving with conviction—rotating into tokens with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the foundation, Solana and XLM offer scale and utility, but MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strategic early entry for those seeking life-changing returns.With Stage 8 heating up and listings on the horizon, this could be the defining moment to secure a position before the next wave begins.

2025-05-21T01:49:40.000Z,"Texas Bitcoin Reserve bill advances to third reading","SB 21, Texas’s bill to create a state-level Bitcoin Reserve, has passed its second reading in the House with overwhelming support. It now requires one more vote and Governor Greg Abbott’s signature to become law. The bill draws inspiration from successful efforts in other states, notably New Hampshire’s model for adding new tokens to its Reserve. Under SB 21, Texas would allow altcoins to be included only if they maintain a market capitalization of at least $500 billion for a continuous period of two years. Texas is rapidly headed to form its own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Legislators voted resoundingly to advance the bill. This legislation hopes to see Texas become the third state to own and operate a state-funded Bitcoin Reserve in the United States. The third and final reading would come next, and experts said that was likely to pass easily. SB 21 passes second reading with strong bipartisan support Upon its second reading, the bill, also called Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), received overwhelming bi-partisan support. The vote was 105 to 23. This demonstrates clear partisan agreement. SB 21 would allow Texas to join the handful of states that already hold Bitcoin by authorizing the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to operate a state-owned Bitcoin Reserve. The fund will strategically invest taxpayer funds in Bitcoin to create a diversified financial portfolio for Texas, including digital and regular assets. To preserve the state’s investment, the reserve will be limited to digital assets with a market capitalization of over $500 billion held for at least two years, meaning only stable and established cryptocurrencies will qualify. The reserve’s operation will be funded through appropriations by the Legislature and other state funding sources. The comptroller’s office, which under the law is also guided by the city’s finance department and the Office of Management and Budget, will be the trustee of the currency and will purchase, hold, and sell Bitcoin on behalf of the reserve. Texas joins New Hampshire and Arizona in establishing state Bitcoin Reserve Texas is on its way to being the third state to create an official Bitcoin Reserve after New Hampshire and Arizona. This is just one example of an emerging trend in the US as more states turn to Bitcoin to help fortify their finances. Popularity has been rising for the initiative to hold Bitcoin after President Donald Trump suggested it was a good idea for states to hold Bitcoin; parties such as the South Carolina GOP found this a good time to ask followers to give their opinions. Supporters believe holding Bitcoin can enable states to hedge against inflation and economic instability. The cryptocurrency market has already felt the impact of news of the bill. Amid the state-backed interest in Bitcoin Reserves, the asset price has soared to $106,000, targeting an all-time high. Confidence in Bitcoin and state-led digital asset initiatives is steadily increasing. While primarily a Bitcoin Reserve, SB 21 also includes other digital assets—provided they maintain a market capitalization of $500 billion or more for at least 24 months. Texas set to approve Bitcoin Reserve as global interest surges The bill now heads to the desk of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it. Abbott has previously expressed support for cryptocurrency projects and is widely expected to sign SB 21 into law. Following Trump’s signing of the Bitcoin Reserve into law, interest in similar initiatives has surged to unprecedented levels. States like Utah, Oklahoma, and Kentucky are inching forward with their versions of a bill to join the industry as early movers. A Ukrainian lawmaker has unveiled plans to introduce a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill to be the first in the EU. However, the move has garnered Binance’s support, with the exchange poised to become a strategic partner for Ukraine’s Bitcoin ambitions. Additionally, Conor McGregor has plans to launch an Irish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the European country. The former UFC fighter has also scheduled a meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to support a nationwide Bitcoin accumulation strategy. UFC fighter turned Irish political hopeful Conor McGregor has endorsed building a Bitcoin Reserve in his country to give more “power back to the people.” “Crypto in it’s origin was founded to give power back to the people. An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people’s money,” McGregor wrote to X on May 9. He wants the Irish people to have a stake in this exciting venture. This suggestion immediately appealed to President Nayib Bukele, who is using aggressive tactics of purchasing Bitcoin for his country and disregarding any institutions that are hesitant in doing so KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/texas-bitcoin-reserve-bill-has-passed/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin reserve|Texas",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T01:46:19.000Z,"XRP Price Prediction: Ripple Could Soar to $4 if This Pattern Continues","The post XRP Price Prediction: Ripple Could Soar to $4 if This Pattern Continues appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price action has been a mix of ups and downs lately, with analysts closely watching important levels to see what happens next. While the market has faced a few pullbacks, the bigger picture still looks hopeful for XRP fans. Key Resistance Holding XRP Back Recently, XRP tried to break through a tough resistance zone between $2.55 and $2.62, but once again, the price got rejected. This area has been a problem for XRP for a while now, just like it has for many other altcoins in the market. After this rejection, the price pulled back slightly, but it’s still holding above important support levels. The Bigger Trend Stays Bullish Even with these small dips, the overall trend for XRP is still moving up. On the daily chart, XRP continues to form higher highs and higher lows, which is a classic sign of an uptrend. Right now, the price is finding support around $2.30 to $2.34, a zone that was previously a resistance area. As long as XRP stays above this level, the bullish momentum is expected to continue. If the price falls below $2.30, however, the next important support sits between $2.10 and $2.15. Dropping below this zone could lead to a deeper pullback in the short term. Short-Term Price Action: Calm Before the Move XRP is still under the effect of a recent bearish divergence, which caused a small drop followed by sideways price movement. At the moment, it looks like XRP won’t make any big moves right away. Bitcoin, which often leads the crypto market, is still holding strong — and when Bitcoin stays steady, altcoins like XRP usually follow quietly for a while before making their moves. Many market watchers believe that if Bitcoin continues its upward trend, XRP could start recovering in the coming days. Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests One More Rally According to a recent market analysis based on the Elliott Wave theory — a popular tool to predict market cycles — XRP might still be in the middle of its fifth and final wave to the upside. This wave likely started when XRP hit a bottom in July last year. If this pattern continues, XRP could aim for new highs, with long-term price targets between $4.20, $5.00, or even $5.65 before a bigger market correction begins. Crucial Support and Resistance Levels to Watch (long term) For now, XRP remains in a tight range. Key resistance sits just above $3.30, while strong support lies at $1.21. As long as the price stays above $1.21, the bullish outlook stays in place. A drop below this level, however, would weaken the current setup and might force analysts to rethink their predictions. In the short term, XRP has completed a five-wave pattern, and according to Elliott Wave rules, a three-wave pullback could be next. The expected support for this pullback lies between $2.60 and $1.79. As long as XRP holds above $1.79, the bullish trend remains safe.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-price-could-soar-to-4-if-this-pattern-continues/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

Join us LIVE as we get started: https://t.co/iwO6ThkaSB — Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) May 20, 2025 On May 12, Adams announced financial services company Figure and private equity firms Traction and Scale would be assisting the city in its crypto efforts. New York City will also be exploring whether certain services and taxes can be paid via crypto, according to Adams, along with using blockchain tech to manage sensitive information such as birth certificates and death records . “Bringing blockchain security capabilities to the city means that birth certificates and death records can remain private but accessible to New Yorkers and their next of kin,” Adams said. “We want to bring jobs of the future to our city today. That means supporting the development of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive tech ecosystem. We must embrace this emerging technology and build on the success of our economy,” he added. Crypto legislation proposed in New York New York State lawmakers have already introduced several bills to regulate crypto. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill to amend the state’s financial law to allow New York State agencies to accept crypto as payment. However, the legislation is yet to reach the state’s full House or Senate. New York state Senator James Sanders Jr proposed the Blockchain Study Act in February, which would create a crypto task force to investigate the current state of crypto in the State. It has yet to advance past the House. Related: Wintermute opens New York office, citing improved US crypto rules Adams made digital assets a large part of his policy platform after assuming office in January 2022 and announced a plan to accept his first three paychecks in Bitcoin ( BTC ). He was indicted on corruption charges over alleged illegal donations from the Turkish government, but Justice Department officials stepped in and directed local authorities to intervene. The case was dismissed with prejudice on April 2, meaning it can’t be reopened. An increasing number of US states are also working on crypto-related legislation, with at least 18 considering bills to establish a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Two states, New Hampshire and Arizona, have successfully passed the legislation, according to Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.

2025-05-21T01:29:55.000Z,"SEC Charges Unicoin, Top Executives With $100M ‘Massive Securities Fraud’","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto company Unicoin and three executives on Tuesday night on fraud charges, saying the company raised over $100 million for tokens that were not actually backed by the real estate its executives claimed. The SEC sued Unicoin , CEO Alexander Konanykhin, former board chair Maria Moschini, senior vice president and general counsel Richard Devlin and former chief investment officer and investor relations officer Alejandro Dominguez on securities law violations, Among its allegations , the SEC said Unicoin never actually owned the real estate properties it told investors it had acquired, and that those properties' values were inflated. \""For example, between September 2023 and January 2024, the Promoting Defendants announced acquisitions of properties in Argentina, Thailand, Antigua, and the Bahamas, purportedly with appraised values totaling more than of $1.4 billion; in fact, the majority of those transactions never closed and the actual combined value of the four properties was no more than $300 million,\"" the complaint said. The defendants also \""overstated the Company's sales\"" of its rights certificates, suggesting in social media posts and to investors that it had raised far more funds than it actually had, the SEC alleged. While Unicoin claimed it had made $3 billion in sales by June 2024, it actually never sold more than $110 million in its rights certificates, according to the complaint. Moreover, Unicoin advertised its rights certificates, including by promising outsized returns of up to 9 million percent, the SEC alleged, pointing to marketing efforts on taxi cabs, ferries, \""office building elevator screens,\"" digital billboards, coasters, television programs, news websites and public wi-fi kiosks. \""Additional examples of the Promoting Defendants’ statements include: (a) social media and website posts that touted potential returns of 9,000,000% based on bitcoin’s 9,000,000% growth in the past 10 years and told investors to 'take advantage of the early days of Unicoin and get them today,' highlighting that 'Bitcoin experienced a tremendous rise in value, transforming early adopters into millionaires, and even billionaires,'\"" the filing said. Read more: Unicoin CEO: Why Are We Still Under the SEC’s Gun? Unicoin received a Wells notice from the SEC last December, informing the company that the regulator — then under the leadership of former Chair Gary Gensler — intended to file securities fraud charges. Last month, Konanykhin sent a letter to Unicoin’s shareholders, informing them that the company had rebuffed the SEC’s attempt to settle the charges, rejecting what he described as an “ultimatum” to attend a settlement negotiation meeting by April 18. “We declined to show up,” Konanykhin told CoinDesk in an April interview, adding that the SEC had made certain pre-meeting demands he deemed “unacceptable” and claiming that the SEC’s probe had caused “multi-billion-dollar damages” to the company.

2025-05-21T01:01:18.000Z,"Crypto’s high price: The global kidnapping crisis targeting digital wealth","Earlier this month, in a leafy suburb of Paris, a young woman and her toddler daughter were violently attacked and nearly abducted. The alleged motive? Her family’s cryptocurrency fortune . In a chilling new reality, digital wealth is no longer just vulnerable to hackers—it’s putting lives on the line in the physical world. Crypto owners are being kidnapped , tortured, and extorted across the globe. From France and India to Latin America and Nigeria, these incidents are rising with alarming frequency as criminals adapt their tactics to pursue a new high-value target: anyone visibly successful in the digital asset space. Crypto is providing criminals with a new type of target Crypto’s allure has always been its promise of autonomy, borderless wealth, and anonymity. However, that autonomy is becoming a liability for individuals who have struck it big. Unlike a bank account that requires bureaucratic steps to access, crypto wallets can be emptied in minutes—under duress. Michael Lyons , an anti-money laundering attorney at Clifford Chance, concurs. He holds, “Crypto transactions are more likely to escape the level of scrutiny applied to traditional banking systems.” In India, a Bengaluru businessman was lured to Lucknow under the pretext of a business deal, only to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of 10 million rupees. In Latin America, kidnapping crews with cartel ties have begun demanding ransom not in cash but in Bitcoin, often using privacy-enhanced coins like Monero to mask their tracks. One Venezuelan crypto trader, who asked not to be named, described being tailed for weeks before armed men intercepted him outside a mall. “They knew what I drove, where I lived, even which exchange I used,” he said. “They held my family until I transferred the funds.” Kidnappers have gone digital The rules of engagement have shifted. Where old-school ransom schemes might involve anonymous wire transfers or suitcases of cash, today’s criminal outfits are leveraging the technologies that gave rise to crypto: decentralization, pseudonymity, and global reach. According to a report by BankInfoSecurity , criminals are increasingly demanding ransom in Monero and other privacy coins because they are harder to trace than Bitcoin. “The privacy coins make the laundering process easier for them, so they obviously prefer it, but they will still accept BTC,” said a cybercrime analyst quoted in the article. In some instances, criminals are no longer waiting for the wealthy to become careless. They’re using facial recognition, blockchain transaction tracking tools, and even SIM swapping attacks to isolate targets. The lines between cybercrime and street-level violence have blurred. The Interpol has also reported increased coordination between cybercrime units and traditional law enforcement as crypto crimes cross national borders. These cases have created a new breed of hybrid criminals employing a mix of digital sophistication and brutal coercion to their nefarious ends. The crypto industry is taking notice Security, once an afterthought in the fast-moving world of crypto, has become a front-and-center concern. Executives and influencers are hiring private security firms, sometimes staffed with former intelligence operatives. High-net-worth individuals are relocating, installing panic buttons, and switching to encrypted communications. Amid a spate of kidnappings and the Coinbase hack, increasingly large crypto holders are hiring private security firms. Some investors have opted for a lower profile. They now conduct meetings virtually, scrub their social media of luxury photos, and use pseudonyms even within crypto communities. This stance is a far cry from the early days of crypto culture—where flexing wealth was part of the brand. Today, discretion is survival. Meanwhile, exchanges and wallet providers are reevaluating their user education practices. Physical security awareness campaigns now supplement tutorials on setting up hardware wallets and using multi-signature authentication. All these initiatives show that while a user’s seed phrase is important, so is their situational awareness. Combating crypto crime requires understanding that air-gapping your wallet is unhelpful if you broadcast your wealth through social media and other means. Law enforcement is playing catch-up While the threats are global, the responses have been fragmented. Law enforcement agencies often lack the technical know-how to investigate crimes involving digital assets. Jurisdictional challenges complicate matters: when a ransom is paid in France and funneled through wallets in Panama, who has authority? Some progress is being made. INTERPOL has launched a Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre to address transnational financial threats, including crypto-related ones. However, international coordination remains a major hurdle. In the U.S., the Department of Justice has stepped up crypto training for its cybercrime units and partnered with blockchain analytics firms to trace illicit transactions. However, experts say the lag between policy formulation and technological evolution is widening. There is also debate about whether crypto platforms should shoulder more responsibility. Some argue exchanges need to implement AI-driven behavior detection systems that could flag suspicious patterns before funds are forcibly withdrawn. Yet privacy advocates caution against sweeping surveillance in the name of safety. They argue that we can’t sacrifice decentralization and privacy entirely to police bad actors. So, we must find ways of achieving that difficult balance. Crypto must address its cultural problem Beyond policy and policing lies a deeper cultural issue: the glamorization of sudden wealth. Crypto communities on YouTube, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter) are rife with images of Lamborghini, luxury watches, and high-rise living. This culture of conspicuous consumption has painted targets on the backs of newcomers and veterans alike. Some of the most at-risk individuals are early adopters who experienced 1000x returns overnight. Many are young, inexperienced with wealth, and unaware of the attention they’re attracting. To these investors, the rising number of crypto kidnappings shouldn’t just be another crime wave. Rather, it’s a wake-up call. They must understand that their success stories must come with robust identity protection, not flaunting their assets and always assuming someone’s watching them. What’s the way forward? As the crypto industry matures, so too must the systems around it. That means that investors need to take personal security as seriously as they take portfolio diversification. Platforms and exchanges should include user education on physical safety, not just cyber hygiene. Furthermore, l aw enforcement agencies need cross-border frameworks and technical expertise to respond effectively. But beyond systems and policy, a cultural shift is needed. We must move away from the glamorization of sudden wealth and toward a culture of security-minded, privacy-conscious engagement with digital finance. Cryptocurrency has opened the door to financial freedom for millions. But freedom, in this case, comes with a price—and for too many, that price is proving far too high. It doesn’t have to be this way. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-05-21T01:00:44.000Z,"79.89% Crash In 24 Hours: What’s Going On With The Shiba Inu Burn?","In a rather unexpected turn of events, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate has plummeted by a staggering 79.89% in just 24 hours. Once considered the cornerstone of Shiba Inu’s deflationary strategy and a key driver behind the meme coin’s long-term value, this dramatic decline in token burns now sparks serious concerns about what’s behind the sharp drop and its impact on the meme coin’s future price. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Suffers Dramatic Decline Shiba Inu’s once-celebrated burn mechanism has recently hit a significant roadblock, with the burn rate crashing almost 80% in just a day. According to Shibburn, the on-chain analytics platform designed to track token burns within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, only 8,258,774 SHIB coins were eliminated in this period. This is a steep drop compared to over 49 million tokens incinerated just a day earlier. The sudden drop in Shiba Inu’s burn rate comes as the meme coin’s price experiences a significant decline. Notably, Shiba Inu’s burn mechanism is a vital part of its tokenomics model. By sending coins to a dead wallet, SHIB tokens are permanently removed from its large circulating supply , which in turn helps increase scarcity and possibly drive up its price over time. Unlike projects with protocol-level burn mechanisms, Shiba Inu’s burning process is mainly community-based . This means that the recent drop in burn rate could reflect a negative shift in market sentiment. This decline in market sentiment may also be attributed to Shiba Inu’s lacklustre price performance and failure to sustain a meaningful rally in recent months. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading lower alongside many altcoins, reflecting market uncertainty. According to CoinMarketCap, its price is sitting at $0.0000144, representing a sharp 39.8% decline from its yearly high. Despite the community’s strong presence and analysts’ optimistic projections, sentiment around SHIB appears muted, with CoinCodex data highlighting indifference rather than enthusiasm. If the burn rate continues to decline, particularly after this 79.89% drop, it could erode confidence in the meme coin’s deflationary narrative and future price. Currently, Shibburn data reports that the total number of SHIB tokens burnt since inception is over 410.7 trillion, leaving approximately 589.2 trillion remaining out of the original maximum supply of over 999.9 trillion. SHIB Price Targets $0.000035 Despite low prices and burn rate crashes, analysts still view Shiba Inu in a bullish light . One of the latest price predictions by market expert ‘Crypto Catalysts’ on X (formerly Twitter) suggests that the Shiba Inu price could soon see a dramatic surge to $0.000035. The analyst noted that SHIB is showing signs of strong upward momentum. According to the shared chart, SHIB has been forming a clear accumulation base between $0.000007 and $0.000014. This zone, which previously acted as a launchpad for the meme coin’s explosive rallies in 2021 and 2023, is once again highlighting strength as SHIB aims for a 147% increase to $0.000035.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/79-89-crash-in-shiba-inu-burn/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Shiba Inu|CoinCodex|Coinmarketcap|Crypto Catalysts|meme coin|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu burn rate|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibburn|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT|tokenomics",cryptocompare

Whale accumulation is on the rise, with three new wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges in recent days.Analysts are targeting $200 as the next major resistance, with bullish technicals supporting further upside. As Solana’s rally matures, traders are diversifying into presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater potential returns. Ethereum: Quiet Build-Up and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, rebounding from recent lows and showing renewed technical strength. With Layer 2 upgrades, DeFi growth, and ETF speculation, ETH is poised for a potential breakout toward $2,750–$2,900 in the coming months.As Ethereum’s rally consolidates, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting investors seeking the next explosive move. TRON: Steady Growth Amid Market Rotation TRON (TRX) is holding at $0.124, maintaining steady growth as network activity remains robust. While not as headline-grabbing as some rivals, TRX’s consistent throughput and low fees make it a favorite in payment corridors.As speculative capital rotates, many TRX holders are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper early-stage upside. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Final Thoughts Bitcoin is steady at the top, XRP is gaining institutional exposure, and Solana and Ethereum are showing technical strength. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is building real pressure just beneath the surface. With Stage 8 nearly full, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year.The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

The company said buying the claims would allow it to purchase Bitcoin at a discount and grow its Bitcoin per share ratio ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities — which is expected to be completed sometime mid this year. Strive hasn’t disclosed any Bitcoin holdings but claims it will face fewer restrictions on purchasing Bitcoin than companies going public through Special Purpose Acquisition Company mergers. Advantages of going public via a reverse merger compared with a SPAC merger. Source: Strive Strive said it would need shareholder approval to pursue Mt. Gox claims. The company said it intends to lodge a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to outline the full terms of the proposed transaction. A proxy statement would then be sent to shareholders to seek their approval. Strive would need to obtain shareholder approval relatively soon, as Mt. Gox is expected to fully repay its creditors by Oct. 31. The Japan-based Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange before it collapsed in 2014 from a security breach that resulted in the theft of approximately 750,000 Bitcoin . Strive’s pivot to become a Bitcoin treasury company reflects a broader industry trend as more firms look to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term strategic asset. Related: Bitcoin ETFs bought 6x more than BTC miners produced last week Twenty One Capital is another newly launched Bitcoin treasury firm that has received backing from the likes of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald. The Jack Mallers-led firm plans to launch with 42,000 Bitcoin once it completes a blank-check merger with Cantor Equity Partners. Asset Entities shares rise again on Mt. Gox plans Asset Entities (ASST), a social media marketing company that Strive announced it would merge with on May 7 to create a Bitcoin investment company, has seen its shares close May 20 trading up 18.2% to $7.74, Google Finance data shows. The latest share price bump brings its market cap to $122.1 million, and ASST is now up 1,170% since Strive announced its merger plan. Strive is expected to own 94.2% of the combined entity once the reverse merger is complete, while Asset Entities will hold the remaining 5.8%. The merged companies will be named Strive and Asset Entities, and will still trade under the ASST ticker.

2025-05-21T00:30:56.000Z,"$500 to 7 Figures? MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP Could Lead 2025’s Political Crypto Boom","Introduction With Bitcoin regaining momentum, XRP drawing institutional flows, and Ethereum breaking out above key resistance, investors are zooming in on a select group of tokens set for major upside in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge—not just for its explosive growth potential, but because Stage 8 is now live and analysts are calling it a high-conviction 40x altcoin candidate. Kaspa (KAS) is also catching attention as its ecosystem expands, but the spotlight is squarely on MAGA, BTC, XRP, and ETH as the market pivots toward political and narrative-driven plays. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 nears completion, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x–40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. With each stage filling rapidly and community growth accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as the final major entry before the price curve steepens and Stage 9 begins. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Political Narrative Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and now less than 7% below the $100,000 mark. On-chain data shows demand rebounding, with major wallets accumulating as US-based ETF inflows stabilize. While institutional conviction is still ramping up, analysts see a plausible summer rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As the political narrative heats up in the US and abroad, Bitcoin’s role as a macro hedge and a political statement is drawing new capital—while early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from this shift in sentiment. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading around $2.39, with forecasts for late 2025 targeting $2.65–$2.80 if current momentum holds. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while whale accumulation continues to rise. Legal clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Kaspa: Technical Strength and Ecosystem Growth Kaspa (KAS) is trading at $0.097, showing resilience after its recent hard fork and ecosystem expansion. Analysts predict moderate gains this year, with a possible move to $0.15 if broader market conditions remain favorable. Kaspa’s unique blockDAG architecture and active developer community are positioning it as a standout proof-of-work contender, but for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as the more aggressive play. Ethereum: Breaking Out With Bullish Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with a target range of $2,750–$2,900 for May and projections as high as $5,925 by year-end. Institutional adoption, Layer 2 advancements, and DeFi growth are all strengthening ETH’s long-term outlook. As Ethereum’s rally matures, smart capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next wave of exponential returns. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly complete, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

2025-05-21T00:00:59.000Z,"Top 4 Fastest Growing Cryptos in 2025: Unstaked, Sui, Cosmos, & DOT!","Several crypto names are gaining serious attention in mid-May, driven by strategic developments and rising activity. Some are introducing new tools, expanding partnerships, or leveraging cross-chain solutions to grow their networks. These moves aren’t just about marketing hype; each coin here shows signs of actual traction. Those tracking the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 will find this mix particularly engaging. The list features projects tied to AI, multichain access, and infrastructure development, offering a broad view of where value is forming. With Unstaked’s rollout plan, Cosmos expanding Ethereum access, and Sui bringing Bitcoin into DeFi, these assets are carving out strong narratives. Some launch major initiatives, while others aim to rebound after market dips. Every pick on this list presents a setup worth noting right now. 1. Unstaked: AI Utilities That Deliver Real Results Unstaked has been gathering momentum for its hands-on AI approach. The platform allows users to run AI agents that manage tasks like handling community posts and automating responses on Telegram and X. These aren’t inactive features; they’re judged by what they achieve, and rewards are based on their work. This system, named Proof of Intelligence, promotes active use instead of passive holding. Every interaction is stored transparently on-chain. With 60% of tokens offered publicly and no allocations for private rounds or VC parties, it gives broader access to early participants. Priced at $0.009267 in stage 13 and targeting a launch price of $0.1819, it reflects a possible ROI of 2700%. There’s also a $1 million prize pool campaign underway. Anyone purchasing at least $100 in $UNSD and completing social steps can enter to win $50,000, 20 winners in total. So far, the presale has raised $6.3 million, with $2 million collected in just two days. While some mention the platform has live agents, it’s important to clarify that these tools will only activate once the presale wraps up and the platform goes live. With a working model, strong interest, and transparent metrics, Unstaked deserves its place among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 2. Sui: Bitcoin Utility and Expanding Features Sui has been pushing forward technically by linking Bitcoin-backed tokens into its ecosystem. Through a tie-up with Bitlayer, Peg-BTC (YBTC) can now be used within Sui’s DeFi framework, allowing BTC holders to earn through the platform. It also teamed up with 21Shares to support real-world asset applications. On top of that, Sui just crossed 8 million new wallet holders this month, which points to rising traction. With its current price near $1.85, down slightly for the day but up nearly 70% in a month, SUI still looks strong. Analysts believe the asset could move toward $6 if this pace holds. The addition of Axelar enables wider dApp development across chains. Thanks to fresh features and cross-chain potential, Sui earns a place on the list of fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 3. Cosmos (ATOM): Enhancing Access and Developer Reach Cosmos has made several updates that support adoption. It was just added to Bitbank, a top exchange in Japan, with zero trading fees during launch. That could draw new trading volume from Asia. But more importantly, Cosmos rolled out IBC v2, which improves how users and developers interact with Ethereum rollups. It makes multi-chain work smoother and cheaper, key for future growth. ATOM is priced around $4.90, with short-term charts hinting a drop toward $4.50 by May 18. However, projections for later this year point to a bounce to $6.80. With improved cross-chain tools and increased exchange access, Cosmos is set to stay on the watchlists of those looking into the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 4. Polkadot (DOT): Development Growth Despite ETF Delay Polkadot has seen mixed sentiment recently after the U.S. SEC delayed its decision on a DOT ETF proposal from 21Shares. This pause caused a slide below $5, and the price currently sits at $4.82, still struggling to break the $5.30 ceiling. Forecasts suggest a short-term dip to $4.45, with potential for a slow rise back to $5.15 later this year. But behind the scenes, development remains active. OpenZeppelin confirmed smart contract compatibility with Polkadot, which opens the door for more dApps on the chain. While prices are soft for now, continued work on developer tools helps Polkadot stay competitive. Its evolving ecosystem keeps it in talks among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025, especially if ETF updates go positive. Final Thoughts! Momentum is forming across these projects. Sui is growing with Bitcoin integration and asset tokenisation, Cosmos is unlocking better Ethereum rollup access, and Polkadot keeps adding dev tools while waiting on ETF clarity. Yet Unstaked remains a standout, combining performance-based AI tools, a strong $6.3 million presale, and an open supply model without outside allocations. Anyone evaluating the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 should keep these four in sight. Sui, Cosmos, and Polkadot all offer strong technical moves, while Unstaked adds an upcoming utility layer tied to real activity. With the launch still ahead, Unstaked also brings a rare entry chance before full rollout. These picks represent some of the sharpest plays in today’s market trends.

2025-05-21T00:00:34.000Z,"Trader Warns Bitcoin (BTC) Flashing Bearish Reversal Signal, Says Gold Gathering Steam for Next Leg Up","A crypto strategist who nailed the Bitcoin top in January is warning that BTC’s recovery rally may witness an abrupt end. Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart. The bearish reversal signal suggests that bullish momentum is waning even though an asset’s price is moving higher or sideways. Says Bluntz, “There’s a daily BTC bear div brewing here if it closes red by [today]. It’s unfortunate that it has appeared before fresh all-time highs, but it’s the first one since last year. Be careful with longs in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,546. Turning to gold, the analyst believes that the precious metal is poised to ignite a rally to a new all-time high after completing an ABC corrective wave. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states a bullish asset will continue its uptrend after an ABC correction. The trader shares a chart suggesting that gold will rally to a new record high of $3,600. “Gold gathering steam for the next leg up here.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, gold is worth $3,221. As for the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ), Bluntz predicts that the altcoin would dip to around $0.00008 before exploding to $0.00018. “Looks like FLOKI is one of the few memes with a clear impulse five-wave rise from the lows on the daily, indicating the low is in. Would be very interested in bidding pullbacks around the 50 fib if given. Have always had a soft spot for this one.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.000098.

2025-05-21T00:00:28.000Z,"Bitcoin Weekly Closes Above Range High Despite Crash From $107,000, Why The Bulls Are Still In Charge","Bitcoin is currently trading around the $105,000 mark after a brief uptick to $107,000 in the past 24 hours. Notably, this marks the second time Bitcoin has rejected around $107,000 in the past few days. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin managed to close last week’s candle above a key resistance level that had capped its price action for weeks. This close, recorded just above the red horizontal line at $103,000, has introduced confidence in the continuation of the uptrend, and points to the bulls still in control of Bitcoin’s price action. Bitcoin Weekly Closes Above Range – First Bullish Step Current Bitcoin price action shows that bullish investors and buyers are still controlling the momentum behind the largest cryptocurrency and, in essence, the rest of the crypto market. Notably, Bitcoin initially experienced a brief surge to nearly $107,000 over the weekend before retreating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top This price movement was followed by a dip to around $102,000, with the back-and-forth most likely being influenced by factors such as Moody’s downgrade of U.S. debt and investor reactions to potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, in an interesting note, the BTC price managed to close above the $103,000 range during this first move to $107,000, which is very important in terms of technical analysis going forward. This sentiment is echoed by crypto analyst Rekt Capital on social media platform X, who pointed out the next step that might play out for Bitcoin. Post-Breakout Retest Underway, Says Rekt Capital The $104,000 price level had previously acted as a stubborn ceiling throughout much of the recent Bitcoin price consolidation between $102,000 and $104,000 since May 9. However, since breaking above this level, the ensuing price action has seen the Bitcoin price retracing towards this level after another rejection at $107,000. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, the dip following the $107,000 rejection isn’t necessarily bearish. Instead, it could be part of a post-breakout retest, a pattern often seen in strong bullish structures. If this retest successfully confirms the former resistance as new support, BTC could set the stage for a breakout into fresh all-time highs. As shown in the 1W Bitcoin price chart above, the red resistance level is very close to Bitcoin’s January 2025 all-time high around $108,780. Furthermore, the chart shows that the recent breakout above the $90,000–$103,000 zone appears to mirror a pattern of Bitcoin’s breakout after a consolidation move, after another bounce from a low. In this case, the bounce occurred at the $75,000 low in early April. If Bitcoin does rebound with enough trading volume around $104,000, this could provide the much-needed momentum for a move above $107,000 and finally above $108,700 again. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,555, up by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.

LINK price has recorded a high correlation with Bitcoin price YTD, which is almost entering a parabolic bullish phase. The gradual Bitcoin (BTC) price rise in the past few weeks, has significantly influenced the wider altcoin market led by Chainlink (LINK). The highly anticipated crypto summer of 2025 has seen the overall capital inflow to the altcoin market experience a sharp uptick. Moreover, an imminent reversal and fall of Bitcoin dominance in the coming months will trigger a sustained altseason, fueled by FOMO traders. Chainlink Network Growth Outlook The Chainlink network has received significant adoption in the past few months amid the mainstream adoption of digital assets and web3 protocols. Furthermore, the Chainlink network enables DeFi protocols to provide reliable services in an interoperable ecosystem. Earlier this week, the Chainlink network announced a strategic integration with the Solana (SOL) network to enable its DeFi ecosystem to access Chainlink’s CCIP infrastructure. On Tuesday, several DeFi protocols announced a strategic integration with the Chainlink network to access its CCIP infrastructure. Some of the notable integrations include Zeus Network, Liquity Protocol, and Shift RWA. The continued adoption of the Chainlink products by institutional investors has bolstered the LINK token, which is used to reward node operators and data providers. Midterm Targets for LINK Price The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.7 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $604 million, has been attempting to recover from last week’s 10 per decline. In the daily timeframe, LINK price has established a rising trend since April 9, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. Moreover, the LINK price has already broken out and retested a falling wedge pattern established in the first quarter of 2025. In the four-hour timeframe, LINK price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, coupled with a rising divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . As a result, LINK price is well positioned to rally towards the next short term target around $19.8.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/chainlink-price-prediction-can-increased-network-adoption-rejuvenate-bullish-momentum-for-link/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|LINK|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Ethereum, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Emerging as Cycle-Defining Picks","Introduction May 2025 is witnessing a sharp rotation of capital as whales and smart money accumulate select tokens. Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this trend, with on-chain data and analyst commentary confirming high-conviction buying. Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is now concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. Institutional confidence is rising as retail investors take profits, and forecasts for May call for an average BTC price of $119,798, with potential highs of $136,239 by month’s end.As Bitcoin’s momentum steadies above $100,000, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors looking to capture the next wave of upside. PRICE COULD SKYROCKET 35x FROM HERE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in whale accumulation as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and Hashex-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025.Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading around $2.07, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next resistance levels.As institutional adoption grows and futures products launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Litecoin: Steady Accumulation and Bullish Outlook Litecoin (LTC) is trading near $76.87, with forecasts for May 2025 ranging from $76.87 to $77.58. While not as volatile as some peers, LTC continues to see steady accumulation by long-term holders.As capital rotates toward high-upside opportunities, many are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE as a complementary play for exponential returns. Ethereum: Macro Strength and Bullish Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, having rebounded from recent lows and showing strong technical momentum.

Prices swung between the upper resistance line and a lower support line, tightening the wedge. Earlier, DOGE surged 8% in a single session, pushing near the top trend line. Daily Trend Break Opportunity on $DOGE 🔥#Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout💹 The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation. Next… pic.twitter.com/tykuWOfAbs — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 19, 2025 Now the coin has dipped back into the wedge, but it’s still trading between those two lines. If the pattern breaks upward, Wujastyk argues that it could set the stage for a rapid move higher. Volume hasn’t spiked yet, so the setup isn’t sealed. But the shape of the chart suggests potential for a breakout. #Dogecoin There’s no way I couldn’t take this trade with a chart that looks like this. Target is a double here around 45 cents. pic.twitter.com/HxbrFVseiv — Jake Wujastyk (@Jake__Wujastyk) May 18, 2025 Analyst Forecasts Rapid Price Rise Based on reports, Wujastyk expects a “twofold rally” from current levels. That means pushing from around $0.21 today to roughly $0.45. That’s about 114% higher. He’s confident there’s “no way you won’t take a Dogecoin trade” if the chart action holds. His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week’s gains. Wujastyk’s bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge’s support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says. Mixed Targets Highlight Uncertainty Another voice, analyst Bitcoinsensus, sees a similar move to above $0.40 but on a slightly different pattern. He points to an inverse head‑and‑shoulders that formed between March and early May. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight The left shoulder came from a March 11 low at $0.14, the head from an April 7 dip to $0.13, and the right shoulder near $0.16 on May 6. After the pattern broke out, DOGE hit a trendline that’s capped gains since December’s $0.48 high. Even with a pullback from that supply zone, Bitcoinsensus says a further push could launch Dogecoin back toward $0.42–$0.43 within seven days. Those targets suggest a 100–104% jump from today’s price.

2025-05-20T22:57:49.000Z,"Bitcoin spotted on Blackstone’s $1 trillion portfolio","In an SEC filing earlier today, May 20, 2025, Blackstone Inc., an asset manager controlling about $1 trillion in funds, disclosed its holdings in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) within its Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund. Per the SEC filing, Blackstone now has indirect exposure to Bitcoin, making the asset manager one of the companies that have incorporated digital assets into their portfolios through regulated financial instruments. Blackstone’s investment in Bitcoin ETFs A SEC filing dated Tuesday, May 20, 2025, has revealed that Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund holds 23,094 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. BlackRock ‘s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF holds and reflects the performance of Bitcoin’s price. As of May 19, 2025, the IBIT ETF’s net asset value (NAV) stood at $59.75, with total net assets amounting to approximately $66.6B and a reported balance of 636,120.5 BTC. Blackstone’s investment in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF shows that the company is taking a measured approach to gaining exposure to Bitcoin while avoiding the risks associated with direct ownership of the cryptocurrency, such as custody and regulatory compliance. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin Blackstone’s May 20 SEC filing revealing its investment in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the latest in a trend of digital assets integration into mainstream financial portfolios. Corporations typically use ETFs like Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust as a regulated and accessible path to participate in the cryptocurrency market. Strategy , which currently holds the position as the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoins, also serves as a vehicle for corporations and public funds to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The company functions as a go-between for investors looking for exposure to cryptocurrencies while protecting themselves from the risks of directly holding these digital assets. Institutional interest in Bitcoin took off after the SEC’s approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust which converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, ProShares Bitcoin ETF and others. The involvement of major financial institutions like Blackstone in cryptocurrency investments also contributes to increased market stability and legitimacy.

2025-05-20T22:56:26.000Z,"Strive plans discounted Bitcoin play with Mt Gox creditor claims","Strive Enterprises, the asset management firm founded by pro-crypto entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, is planning to buy distressed Bitcoin claims. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm said this would allow it to gain BTC exposure at a discount. According to the filing , the Ohio-based corporation is partnering with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to source for such claims and purchase them. The filing specifically mentioned the Mt Gox bankruptcy estate with approximately 75,000 Bitcoin, noting that such distressed and definitive claims could be cheaper. It said: “This strategy is intended to allow Strive the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin exposure at a discount to market price, enhancing Bitcoin per share and supporting its goal of outperforming Bitcoin over the long run.” The Bitcoin stash of the defunct Japanese exchange has been a subject of multiple discussions in the crypto industry since 2014, when they were stolen and the exchange filed for bankruptcy. While efforts to repay creditors have been ongoing for several years, many are still unpaid because they have yet to complete the required process. This has led to multiple extensions of the repayment deadline, with the extension coming in October 2025. Unsurprisingly, there have been concerns that selling pressures from Mt Gox repayments could affect the Bitcoin price as many creditors could opt to sell. If Strive can achieve its plan, the firm could absorb the selling pressures while ending several creditors’ wait for repayment. Strive pushing to redefine corporate Bitcoin exposure. The move by Strive shows how the company adopts a different approach to Bitcoin treasury adoption. Unlike Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) approach of accumulating Bitcoin for its treasury, Strive wants to outperform the flagship asset. In order to achieve this, the firm plans to use several innovative strategies to gain Bitcoin exposure at a discount without diluting its share value. Strive’s Chief Financial Officer, Ben Pham, said: “Strive intends to use all available mechanisms, including novel financial strategies not used by other Bitcoin treasury companies, to maximize its exposure to Bitcoin.” One of the strategies is using Section 351 of the US tax code for tax-deferred Bitcoin for equity swaps. Under this framework, accredited Bitcoin holders can swap their BTC for Strive equity without paying capital gains. The firm also plans to buy cash at a discount by merging with public companies with more cash than their stock value, with the excess cash spent on acquiring more Bitcoin. Other planned strategies include deploying its fixed income and derivative expertise to leverage and hedge risks for Bitcoin acquiring and raising external public capital. So far, Strive has made progress toward its goal, with the firm recently merging with publicly traded social media technology company Asset Entities Inc. That move allowed it to become publicly traded and, therefore, have access to public capital. 85 companies now hold over 800,000 BTC While Strive is working on strategies to acquire Bitcoin, several publicly traded companies are accumulating it in the old-fashioned way. According to data from HODL15 Capital, 85 companies currently hold over 800,000 Bitcoin as of May 19. Leading the pack is Strategy, which now has 576,230 BTC in its treasury. Companies such as Marathon Digital, TwentyOne, and Riot Platforms are way behind, each with less than 50,000 BTC. Bitcoin Treasury Companies (Source: Hodl15Capital) However, companies such as Metaplanet and Semler Scientific have increased their exposure to BTC in the past few weeks, and Metaplanet is now close to entering the top 10. The firm is ranked eleventh with 7,800 BTC, while Block (formerly Square) is tenth with 8,584 BTC. With Metaplanet aiming to finish 2025 with 10,000 BTC, the Japanese firm could have more BTC than Coinbase by the end of the year.

BTC price is on the cusp of rallying toward a new all-time high catalyzed by high demand from institutional investors. The Texas Strategic Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve bill (SB 21) passed the second reading of the House on Tuesday, May 20, with 105 yes votes against 23 nays. The Texas’ SB 21 bill now moves to a third house reading and the final move. As a result, Dennis Porter, the CEO and Co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, now estimates that Texas will be the third state to pass the SBR legislation into law. Moreover, the Texas’ SB 21 bill has massive backing from legislators led by Representative Giovanni Capriglione and Senator Charles Schwertner. The Texas SB 21 bill confirms that the United States will imminently approve its SBR legislation to purchase up to 1 million BTCs in the next five years.

According to the report, Bitcoin’s recent strong price performance has led to significant improvements in investor portfolios, leading many investors to take steps toward risk reduction and profit taking. Glassnode reported that driven by these new capital inflows, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap has reached an all-time high above $900 billion for the first time, marking a major turning point in the asset’s history. Bitcoin rose to $107,000 in the past days and today according to Binance TR data, approaching its all-time high (ATH) of $109,000, which it reached in December 2024. This rise triggered new capital inflows into the market, paving the way for the Realized Market Value to break its historical record.

This group of investors has seen a significant increase in spending, with a daily realized profit of $747 million and a total of $11.4 billion in the last 30 days. Apart from Bitcoin, Ethereum’s price has also seen a significant increase in recent weeks. It was stated that this increase could be related to the positive atmosphere created by the successful Pectra upgrade that took place on May 7. Ethereum has shown statistically significant increases on a daily basis several times. In particular, the single-day increase of 21.8% attracted attention as the strongest increase since May 2021.

Argentina's Milei shuts down task force investigating LIBRA scandal Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved a task force established to investigate the fallout from LIBRA, the scandalous cryptocurrency project the head of state promoted on his social media channel before it crashed to zero. The Investigative Task Force (ITU) was dissolved via a May 19 decree signed by Milei and Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, government documents revealed . “The Research Task Unit is dissolved” after completing its mandate, the translated version of the decree read. The task force is being dissolved despite pressure from opposition groups, which are seeking to activate an investigative commission as soon as May 20, local media outlet Clarin reported .

German government missed out on $2.3 billion profit after selling Bitcoin at $57,000 The German government missed out on more than $2 billion worth of Bitcoin profit after selling its holdings in 2024, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham. A “ German Government (BKA) ” labeled cryptocurrency wallet sold 49,858 Bitcoin ( BTC) worth over $2.89 billion at an average price of $57,900 across multiple transactions during June and July in 2024.

The legislation, introduced by Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), seeks to establish a federal framework for stablecoin issuers, requiring full asset backing, monthly reserve disclosures, and annual audits for issuers exceeding $50 billion in market capitalization. The bill also restricts algorithmic stablecoins and prohibits large technology firms from issuing stablecoins unless they meet financial risk and consumer privacy criteria. The vote comes two weeks after Senate Democrats blocked the measure, citing concerns over consumer protections and potential conflicts of interest related to President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures. “The bill as it currently stands still has numerous issues that must be addressed, including adding stronger provisions on anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, national security, preserving the safety and soundness of our financial system, and accountability for those who don’t meet the act’s requirements.” Several Democratic senators later changed their stance, allowing the bill to proceed to debate on the Senate floor. The GENIUS Act is expected to face further amendments before a final vote, which could take place as early as the end of the week. If enacted, the bill would mark the first federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a sector currently valued at nearly $250 billion.

2025-05-20T22:00:40.000Z,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key","Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC. There is little doubt that institutional buying remains the primary catalyst for Bitcoin to break above the $108,000 level. Such a move would trigger the liquidation of heavily leveraged bearish positions, likely accelerating the push to a new all-time high. However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000. The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) supports the lower range. The relative strength index (RSI), although still near the overbought region, has significantly cooled over the past few days. An ETH breakout with rising RSI and volume could confirm the bullish move, while a drop below $2,400 risks invalidating the pattern.Can Ether reclaim the Gaussian Channel midline?On May 20, Ether showed a significant trend shift as it attempted to reclaim the mid-line of the 2-week Gaussian Channel, a technical indicator used to identify price trends. The Gaussian or Normal Distribution Channel plots price movements within a dynamic range, adapting to market volatility. Historically, when ETH crosses above this mid-line, significant rallies often follow.

The analyst said,“I am leaning toward price carving out a range bound environment for at least several weeks potentially longer, and once again becoming a buyer.”A contrarian outlook to bulls can also be observed with ETH prices oscillating under the Fibonacci levels. Cointelegraph reported that Ether recently retested the 0.5 to 0.618 Fib levels, which could trigger a short-term correction for ETH. In such a scenario, the immediate area of support remains around $2,150 and $1,900, possibly slowing down the bullish momentum for a prolonged period. Ethereum 1-week price analysis.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation. Robinhood is committed to leading this trend under a compliant framework,” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said.Related: SEC Chair: Blockchain ‘holds promise’ of new kinds of market activityTokenization gains momentumRobinhood’s proposal comes amid a renewed wave of interest in RWA tokenization, with major players from both traditional finance and crypto making headlines last week.On April 30, BlackRock filed to create a blockchain-based share class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund, allowing a digital ledger to mirror investor ownership.

The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.“A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm “is keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.” The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects.Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin?Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or notHayes noted that “Payjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don’t use it.” Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily.Allen told Cointelegraph he is “building out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.” He explained that encouraging its adoption “is the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.” The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that “a key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.” “In particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,” they added.Magazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-payjoin-privacy-grant-maelstrom?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T03:08:27.000Z,"SEC’s Crenshaw says agency playing ‘regulatory Jenga’ with crypto","The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s sole Democratic Commissioner has said the agency is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga” with its approach to the crypto industry and market regulation under the Trump administration. In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.”Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.”Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-crenshaw-agency-playing-regulatory-jenga-with-crypto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19.Alpenglow consists of Votor, which processes voting transactions and block finalization logic, and Rotor, a data dissemination protocol that would replace Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping system and aim to reduce the time it takes for all nodes to agree on the network state.Source: AnzaAnza researchers claimed that “Alpenglow will shatter both these latency bounds” and the project expects it to reach actual finality in about 150 milliseconds, rivaling internet infrastructure.“A median latency of 150 [milliseconds] does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance.”Votor — which would replace TowerBFT — would aim to finalize blocks in a single round if 80% of the stake is participating, and in two rounds if only 60% of the stake is responsive.Related: DeFi lender Aave reaches $40B in value locked onchainThese two voting modes are integrated and run concurrently, with finalization taking place as soon as the faster of the two paths terminates.Anza’s researchers claimed this model would result in “unprecedented finalization latency” while enabling it to operate more effectively under “harsh network conditions.”Alpenglow won’t fix Solana’s network outagesThe project’s white paper noted that switching to Alpenglow wouldn’t completely shield Solana from the network outages that it has experienced in the past.Solana currently only has one production-ready client, Agave, meaning any security vulnerability in Agave can disrupt the entire Solana network.However, a new independent validator client called Firedancer is set to launch on Solana’s mainnet sometime this year, which will provide client diversification for the network.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-labs-offshoot-anza-consensus-protocol-alpenglow?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility.The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio.

Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!”While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic newsletter, pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated,“Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison.

Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin.

However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held.

2025-05-19T20:44:50.000Z,"Bitcoin futures data aligns with BTC traders’ hope for new all-time highs","Key takeaways:Bitcoin buying in the spot and futures markets helped BTC price keep its upward momentum despite $170 million in margin liquidations.Weak stablecoin demand in China and the limited use of futures leverage suggest Bitcoin’s current rally is sustainable.Bitcoin (BTC) price has displayed strength at the $102,000 support level on May 19, following the $170 million in liquidations of leveraged positions. The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.Bitcoin 1-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chThe annualized one-month futures premium for Bitcoin remained close to 6% despite the retest of $102,000 support. This current level is within the 5% to 10% neutral range, which has been the norm over the past week. While at first glance such data might suggest a lack of optimism, at the same time, it proves that the buying pressure is coming from the spot market rather than from leveraged bets.Japan bond spike and credit fears weigh on Bitcoin sentimentSome analysts attribute Bitcoin’s correction to comments by Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the country’s fiscal situation being “undoubtedly extremely poor,” as reported by Bloomberg. Japan 15-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China. Periods of excessive optimism usually lead to stablecoins trading above fair value, which is not a healthy indicator, as Bitcoin jumps above $105,000.USDT Tether (USDT/CNY) vs. US dollar/CNY. Source: OKXUSD Tether (USDT) has been trading at a slight 0.4% discount in China, meaning Bitcoin’s price increase has likely not been driven by FOMO. The absence of excessive leverage on Bitcoin futures and the lack of desperate inflows into Chinese markets are key ingredients for sustainable price gains, paving the way for a more solid bullish momentum above $105,000.Bitcoin shrugs off bad news, holds support amid strong spot demandBitcoin’s price displayed significant resilience after the announcement of a class-action lawsuit against Strategy’s top executives, claiming “false and/or misleading statements” regarding risks associated with Bitcoin’s investment. The complaint specifically mentions unrealized losses, although those events do not affect the company’s cash flow.Regardless of whether the case has foundation, negative headlines tend to have a much stronger and longer price impact in neutral to bearish markets, which clearly was not the case as Strategy (MSTR) shares traded up 2.4% on May 19. Additionally, the fact that the $102,000 support held amid increased global economic uncertainty, combined with strong spot buying and resilient derivatives metrics, provides every indication that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further price gains.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: Coin360Although Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish, repeated failure to break above the overhead resistance may tempt short-term traders to book profits. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological level of $100,000.What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its up move last week, indicating continued buying by the bulls.SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA ($100,787) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support.

There is minor resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then slump to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.XRP/USDT daily chart.

The price action inside the range is expected to be random and volatile.The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2.65 or below $2. If buyers pierce the $2.65 resistance, the pair could travel to $3.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($635) on May 18, but the higher levels attracted selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls.

If they succeed, the pair may start its northward march toward the overhead resistance of $745.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA clears the path for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($606) and later to $580.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($163) on May 17, but the bulls could not push the price above the $180 resistance.SOL/USDT daily chart.

A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe pullback could deepen if the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the SUI/USDT pair could skid to $3.12 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.97).On the contrary, if the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA and rises above $3.90, it suggests a positive sentiment. That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5.

The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts.

This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Source: BinanceThe UAE also provides its own incentives, such as no personal income tax and free zones like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) offer 0% corporate tax advantages and 100% foreign ownership.Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearingsCrypto firms have reported easier access to banking services in Dubai, which is an improvement over the challenges companies say they’ve faced in the US under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”Hong Kong makes crypto hub push with retail access and staking ETFsHong Kong has long acted as a financial gateway to mainland China, where crypto activities like mining and trading remain banned.Previously, the city had a voluntary licensing regime, when only OSL and HashKey were licensed to serve institutions and professional investors. In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market. As of now, 10 platforms are licensed, while 15 have either withdrawn or been rejected.Eight applicants in Hong Kong still wait the SFC’s decision.

It has also introduced stablecoin sandboxes under the supervision of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to trial approved digital assets in a controlled environment.“Sandboxes are an experiment, so too are staking ETFs,” said Kelvin Koh, a Spartan Group co-founder. “The key point is that these experiments are happening in Hong Kong.”Hong Kong recently released its ASPIRe roadmap in February 2025, which aims to foster blockchain innovation and fill regulatory gaps to set the city up as a global crypto hub.Hong Kong’s five-pillar strategy to become a crypto hub.

As Arvin Abraham, partner at law firm Goodwin’s private equity group, told Cointelegraph, crypto was once central to Sunak’s competitiveness agenda, but under the current Labour government, that focus has faded.The new Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, spearheaded by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, highlights fintech as a priority without a focus solely on crypto.“The UK does not feel like it’s prioritizing it as much as it was a few years ago,” Abraham said.In January, Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its UK office to move back to the US. Source: Anthony AlbaneseAbraham added the UK remains “one of the best places to set up a new startup,” especially for early-stage capital raising. He points to generous tax incentives for angel investors and the unique convergence of finance and startups in London, calling it “probably one of the best cities in the world for fintech-type businesses.” In that sense, even without headline-grabbing crypto policy, the UK’s structural appeal still draws Web3 firms — just now with a quieter backdrop.Magazine: South Africa’s digital-nomad crypto hub: Cape Town, Crypto City Guide",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cash-code-crypto-hub-uk-us-singapore?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The company reportedly used USB drivers to distribute malware-ridden drivers and uploaded the compromised software to cloud storage for global download.A total of 9.3 BTC worth over $953,000 have been stolen, according to the report. Crypto tracking and compliance firm Slow Mist described how the malware operates in a May 19 X post:“The official driver provided by this printer carries a backdoor program.

Coward turned to Reddit, where he shared the issue with cybersecurity professionals, attracting the attention of cybersecurity firm G-Data.G-Data’s investigation found that most of Procolored’s drivers were hosted on the file hosting service MEGA, with uploads as old as October 2023. Analysis of those files confirmed that they were compromised by two distinct pieces of malware: backdoor Win32.Backdoor.XRedRAT.A and a crypto stealer designed to substitute addresses in the clipboard with those controlled by the attacker.G-Data contacted Procolored, with the hardware producer saying it deleted the infected drivers from its storage on May 8 and re-scanned all files. Procolored attributed the malware to a supply chain compromise, stating that the malicious files were introduced through infected USB devices before being uploaded online.Related: Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-stealer-malware-found-in-official-printer-drivers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T14:00:00.000Z,"Franklin taps blockchain to offer yield on idle payroll funds","Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi’s audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.Related: How to Use tsUSDe on TON for Passive Dollar Yield in 2025Rising interest in yield-generating strategiesInterest in yield-generating strategies within the cryptocurrency sector has surged in recent years, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking to maximize returns on their digital assets.On May 16, Solv Protocol launched a yield-bearing Bitcoin token on the Avalanche blockchain, giving institutional investors more exposure to yield opportunities backed by real-world assets, or RWAs.On May 1, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, said the demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/franklin-launches-payroll-treasury-yield-defi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
