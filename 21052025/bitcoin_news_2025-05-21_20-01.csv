2025-05-21T17:51:07.000Z,"As Bitcoin Sets a New Record, Massive Altcoin Whales Are Back in Action — Here Are Their Transactions and Tokens of Focus","It's a historic day in the cryptocurrency markets. According to market data, Bitcoin broke its all-time high price record today, reaching $109,496 on Coinbase. This new high comes 121 days after the previous record of $109,353. Bitcoin has risen 47% since bottoming at $74,508 on April 9. As a result of this rise, Bitcoin's market dominance increased to 64.25%, while the total market value of altcoins decreased by 26.67% from its current peak. Related News: BREAKING: Bitcoin Hits All-Time High Price Record - Celebration in the Air With this jump in Bitcoin price, whale activity also increased significantly: According to on-chain data, three different wallets thought to belong to the same organization or whale transferred approximately $3.75 million worth of LINK tokens to Binance two hours ago. These whales had created LINK positions at an average of $13 in the June-October 2024 period. If sold at today's transfer price of $15.86, a profit of approximately $764,000 could be made. A newly created wallet recently withdrew 199,423 TRUMP tokens worth $2.92 million from Binance. The purpose behind this transaction is currently unknown. A whale that has been sleeping for 6 years transferred 1,613 ETH (approximately $4.11 million) to the Kraken exchange. These ETHs were purchased 8 years ago for $544,000, and with this transfer, the whale made a profit of approximately $3.62 million. At the same time, an address thought to be an institutional wallet or whale withdrew 1,500 BTC ($159.7 million) from Binance. The address currently has a total of 22,223 BTC in its wallet, worth around $2.37 billion. A famous investor who made a total of $21.54 million in two major waves with the Uniswap (UNI) altcoin in 2020 has started collecting UNI again after three years of silence.

2025-05-21T17:47:08.000Z,"Cookie crypto price soars 27.06% after perfect bounce: is a breakout to $0.26 next?","Cookie Coin has rallied over 27% after bouncing from a high-confluence support zone. With price now testing major resistance, consolidation could pave the way for a breakout toward higher targets. Cookie Coin ( COOKIE ) has shown remarkable strength, rising more than 27% following a precise bounce off a high-timeframe support level at $0.15. This wasn’t just any level, it marked the confluence of multiple technical indicators, including the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, the channel low of a bullish trading channel, and the 200-day moving average. The alignment of these indicators provided a high-confidence entry zone, which has now led to a powerful upside move. Currently, Cookie is trading at a key resistance area near $0.22, a level that demands attention from both bulls and bears. This resistance aligns with the upper boundary of the bullish trading channel, as well as a volume profile value-up resistance pulled from the all-time high. Despite testing this critical zone, Cookie remains structurally bullish. Key technical points Major Support Held: $0.15 support held strong, backed by 0.618 Fib, 200 MA, and channel support Current Resistance: Testing $0.22 zone, in confluence with HTF channel resistance and volume node Market Structure: Higher highs and higher lows remain intact Potential Next Target: Breakout above $0.22 could send price toward $0.26 COOKIEDAOUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView The recent move from $0.15 to $0.22 was not only sharp but also technically sound. The support zone at $0.15 acted as a stronghold of confluence, providing a solid launchpad for this breakout. As Cookie now tests the $0.22 resistance zone, it faces its next significant challenge. A clean break above this resistance may not occur immediately. Given the scale of the recent move, a consolidation phase would be a healthy development. Ideally, traders should look for the formation of a bullish pennant or a short-term ascending channel just below resistance. These structures often precede breakout moves, allowing the market to gather momentum. You might also like: BTC surges: Explore cloud mining with BTC to earn $20,000 a day While there’s always the possibility of a continued pump without consolidation, the more sustainable path would involve some sideways movement that builds pressure beneath the $0.22 level. If that occurs, it could act as a launchpad toward the next resistance at $0.26, a natural magnet for price continuation. What to expect in the coming price action If Cookie consolidates under $0.22 and maintains its bullish structure, a breakout toward $0.26 is highly probable. The overall trend remains strong, and technicals support continued movement to higher levels with a confirmed bullish setup.

2025-05-21T17:45:31.000Z,"Tariff Truce and Liquidity Fuel Bitcoin to $109,000 All-Time High — What’s Next for BTC?","Bitcoin price rallied to a new all-time high above $109,000 on May 21, propelled by a sudden thaw in global trade tensions and expectations of looser monetary policy. The cryptocurrency traded around $109,369 on late trading, extending a rally that lifted prices about 6% in the past week. This move follows a breakthrough above $100,000 earlier in May, as investors responded to signs that President Trump’s global tariff offensive might be easing. Trade Truce Sparks Global Rally The immediate catalyst was a surprise 90-day “tariff truce” between the United States and China . On May 12, officials in Geneva announced a pause on new levies and sharp rollbacks of existing duties, slashing reciprocal tariffs by roughly 115 percentage points to about 10%. Global markets leaped on the news: stock futures and Asian equities jumped, and commodity prices rallied on hopes of a broad trade-war détente. Bitcoin investors also took notice. Analysts note that the tariff pause removed the risk of ‘sudden re‑escalation’, which had been weighing on risk appetite. In other words, as the trade conflict eased, risk assets like Bitcoin rallied without the overhang of fresh tariffs. Liquidity Surge and Institutional Flows Broader macroeconomic conditions have added fuel to the crypto rally. Central banks worldwide are signaling easier policy. In the U.S., futures markets are now priced at multiple rate cuts this year, and a weaker dollar has coincided with renewed growth in global money supply. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has maintained an accommodative stance, and the Bank of Japan continues massive asset purchases, reinforcing the loose global liquidity backdrop. China’s central bank has also begun pumping cash into markets. Such ample liquidity typically lifts risk assets, and Bitcoin has benefited accordingly. At the same time, institutional investors have been pouring into crypto. Hedge funds and asset managers have funneled record sums into spot-Bitcoin ETFs and futures, betting on higher prices. Leading figures in the crypto industry have expressed firm bullish conviction. Former PayPal and Meta executive David Marcus tweeted , “ the bull case for Bitcoin has never been stronger,” citing easier custody solutions at banks and competition from sovereign and corporate buyers. Changpeng Zhao, co-founder of Binance, echoed this optimism. Analysts even project Bitcoin could reach around $150,000 if regulatory conditions remain favorable. Bitcoin Market Outlook Looking ahead, analysts are divided on just how far Bitcoin can climb. Some have raised year-end targets above $130,000. Jamie Coutts of Real Vision warns that the relentless expansion of fiat money means Bitcoin “may push…above $132,000” by late 2025. Source: X Even major banks have revised their models: Standard Chartered’s crypto research team recently suggested that a $120,000 second-quarter price target might be “too low”. On the other hand, many caution that the rally could pause or correct if global liquidity peaks or regulators tighten. Bitcoin’s price historically follows four-year “halving” cycles tied to new coin issuance, and some forecasters see the current monetary easing lasting through 2025. Those forces could cool Bitcoin’s momentum if central banks eventually reverse course or inflation spikes. For now, however, the rare alignment of easing trade tensions and abundant liquidity, coupled with growing institutional adoption, has set the stage for one of crypto’s strongest rallies.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/tariff-truce-and-liquidity-fuel-bitcoin-to-109000-all-time-high-whats-next-for-btc/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

Michael Saylor , whose company is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ), made the statement as the latest Bitcoin rally sent BTC to a new all-time high above $109,500. The spike also pushed 100% of Bitcoin-holding addresses into profit. But despite the rally to a record high for the benchmark digital asset, Saylor took to X to share his bullish take on BTC. “If you’re not buying bitcoin at the all-time high, you’re leaving money on the table,” the MicroStrategy founder posed via X. His remarks echo a previous statement, also shared via the platform, as Bitcoin approached its prior all-time high. You might also like: BREAKING: Bitcoin hits new all-time high at $109,400.68 The Strategy founder’s comments align with his recent prediction that BTC may soon become too expensive for investors who hesitate at current levels. In his view, this scenario is likely amid an impending wave of institutional investment into Bitcoin. Specifically, analysts suggest that banks and other financial institutions are on the verge of a major push into Bitcoin. When this happens, the price could skyrocket, and those who miss out, even at today’s record highs, may not be able to buy in later. “When banks finally bless Bitcoin and the experts agree it’s a good idea,everyone will want to buy it,no one will need to sell it,and you won’t be able to afford it,” Saylor said in late April.

2025-05-21T17:40:36.000Z,"Bitcoin Makes History as the 5th Largest Asset – BTC Bull Token Is the Best Altcoin to Buy Now","Bitcoin just made history. Again. The crypto king flies above $109K now, and the whole market rejoices. The daily chart is looking green all around, and the 24-hour trading volume is up by 20%. And because good news always comes in pairs, Bitcoin just surpassed Amazon by market cap, becoming the 5th largest asset in the world . At the same time, Vivek’s Strike Asset Management wants to buy 75K Bitcoins ($8.17B) from Mt. Gox to build its own Bitcoin Treasury. And one more, for good measure—Standard Chartered said Bitcoin could hit $500K by the end of 2028 , as per the SEC 13F filings. With all this in the oven, and $BTC exploding past $109K, is the sky the limit? That seems increasingly like it, and one presale meme coin is positioned to follow Bitcoin to the moon – BTC Bull Token . Let’s see why that is, and how the world reacts to Bitcoin’s historical move. Strategy Bet on the Right Horse & the Bulls Were Right Saylor’s Strategy now owns 576,230 Bitcoins (around $62.8B at the current valuation), bought at an average price of $66,384 per Bitcoin. So, Strategy’s looking at a 64.2% profit, or $24.56B, in almost five years. Strategy’s consistent success with $BTC trickled down the grapevine, convincing more and more companies (and states) to invest in it: Mara Holdings has 48,137 Bitcoins now ($5.26B) Elon Musk’s Tesla made $600M in Bitcoin profits in Q4 2024 Goldman Sachs has over 30.8M Bitcoin ETF holdings Metaplanet is on a Bitcoin buying spree JPMorgan finally embraced Bitcoin while Fidelity says $BTC can ‘carry gold’s baton’ Countries like the US, Dubai, and Thailand are accepting Bitcoin left and right The Bitcoin craze is so powerful among companies and countries that Standard Chartered recently released a $500K Bitcoin target by 2028. The justification? The latest 13F data from the SEC, which shows that Bitcoin is attracting a lot of institutional buyers. The bulls were onto something, which was Bitcoin’s inevitable rise. And just two hours ago, over $50M worth of Bitcoin shorts were liquidated in just 60 minutes as the bears suffered catastrophic losses. So, can you still ride the Bitcoin rally? With a $109K price tag, all you can buy is fractions, with minimal profit margins. Fortunately, one presale can help with that. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will give you free Bitcoin as airdrops if you buy and hold the tokens in Best Wallet . Here’s what you need to know about it. BTC Bull Token Could Be Your Ticket to 1,000x in This Bitcoin Rally Enter BTC Bull Token, one of the best presales of 2025. First, the token tracks Bitcoin’s price and burns a portion of the total supply when $BTC hits certain milestones (like $125K and $150K). This increases scarcity and thus the token price. And second, $BTCUBLL holders receive automatic Bitcoin airdrops for free as Bitcoin keeps climbing (increments of $50K). With one giant airdrop happening when $BTC hits $250K. The presale has already raised over $6M, investors have staked over 1.5M tokens, and the token price is only $0.002525 – an all-time low (the next price increase is in two days). For only $200, you could buy 79,207 $BTCBULL. Assuming you stake them at an average APY of 25%, you’d have 99,008 tokens in one year. At that point, the token price could be around $0.0187, based on our price prediction . You’d have $1,851 from just a $300 investment now, or $9,257 if you invested (and staked) $1,000. And that’s not counting all the free Bitcoin you’d have if the crypto king cracks milestone after milestone and reaches upward of $150K (but remember to hold the tokens in Best Wallet). BTC Bull Token is probably the smartest way to leverage Bitcoin’s current bull run because all you have to do is buy and hold. The rest takes care of itself. And buying $BTCBULL has never been easier, thanks to its native integration with Best Wallet —the first wallet that lets you buy presales from the wallet app. With Bitcoin looking primed to shoot past $110K and beyond, early $BTCBULL buyers get what could possibly be the opportunity of a lifetime: owning Bitcoin without buying it. Bitcoin & BTC Bull Token: A Match Made on the Blockchain Bitcoin is here to stay. We’re not the ones saying that—Strategy, the Trump administration, Goldman Sachs, and many others are. And BTC Bull Token is the best altcoin closest to Bitcoin’s success. Both the token burn mechanism and free $BTC airdrops are designed to give token holders the highest profits as $BTC keeps climbing. But remember, presales and meme coins are risky by their very nature. The market is volatile, and you never know how the market will react later down the line.

2025-05-21T17:25:00.000Z,"Why was Dogecoin up 8% on Wednesday?","Dogecoin has seen a significant rally today, following broader market momentum and strong technicals. Dogecoin (DOGE) performed strongly on Wednesday, continuing the May rally. The token rose to $0.2375, up 8% in the last 24 hours. This movement was driven by a combination of factors, including broader market momentum and bullish technical signals. For one, technicals flashed positive signals, with Dogecoin’s price forming a bullish flag pattern . Specifically, this is when a price rises sharply, following a consolidation near the top. This typically indicates that a breakout is coming. You might also like: Dogecoin price prediction: Head and shoulders breakout points to $0.30 target A potential driver of this bullish momentum was whale accumulation. Notably, holdings on addresses containing between 1 million and 10 million DOGE rose to 10.56 billion coins on May 20, up from 10.48 billion on May 10. Dogecoin sees strong month, is altcoin season coming? Dogecoin’s growth coincided with Bitcoin’s (BTC) all-time high of $109,487, which was a culmination of the May bullish market. Most other altcoins have seen strong growth in that period, including Dogecoin. Notably, in the last 30 days, Dogecoin was up 43.96%. What is more, most of that surge happened between May 7 and May 11. You might also like: Dogecoin price remains stuck as whale accumulation continues Still, despite strong performance among many altcoins, Bitcoin continues to dominate investor interest.

Moreover, the majority of the top 100 altcoins are still in the red over the past 90 days. This includes major tokens such as Solana, Cardano, Shiba Inu, and even Dogecoin. Specifically, Dogecoin is still down 8.31% over the last three months. That said, momentum for altcoins appears to be growing.

2025-05-21T17:24:53.000Z,"BTC Price to Hit $600,000 in 90 Days: Analyst’s Wild Bitcoin Price Prediction Explained","Crypto analyst Fred Krueger recently outlined a dramatic scenario in which Bitcoin’s price explodes from roughly $150,000 to $600,000 between July 21 and Oct. 19, 2025. He released this forecast on social media as a five-stage plan (dubbed “The Last Rally”). In Krueger’s view, each phase involves major financial shocks—from a failed U.S. Treasury auction to a new Bretton Woods–style summit—that together would drive a parabolic Bitcoin rally. Krueger’s outline breaks down into sequential “phases,” each building toward the rally. In summary: Phase I: A $200 billion U.S. Treasury auction fails, prompting the Fed to signal “extraordinary measures.” In this environment, Bitcoin briefly jumps (from $158k to $165k) and gold hits $4,200. Simultaneously, BRICS countries establish an independent payment network using gold and Bitcoin. Phase II: A major U.S. pension fund defaults on obligations. The Fed imposes yield curve control , capping 10-year yields at 6.5%, and the dollar weakens sharply. Under these conditions, Krueger projects Bitcoin at $215,000, oil around $122, and gold about $5,800. (He also notes Germany pledges to back the euro with new gold reserves.) Phase III: U.S. home prices plunge 35% and 10-year Treasury yields spike above 8.5%. Bitcoin surges to about $390,000 in this turmoil while gold reaches $8,900. Each of these phases is meant to stoke a flight to alternative assets. For example, in Phase I, Bitcoin and gold initially rise on the chaos, and by Phase III, soaring yields and housing losses further erode confidence in fiat. All dollar figures above are Krueger’s estimates for that stage. Corporate Moves and Currency Restructuring Krueger’s final phases bring in corporate buyers and a full currency reset: Phase IV: Major tech giants (Apple, Tesla, Google) “convert their balance sheets to Bitcoin.” Apple alone accumulates 200,000 BTC. Latin American governments also turn to crypto. Meanwhile, the IMF announces a new global reserve basket (50% Bitcoin, 30% gold, 10% yuan, 10% other) and the Bank of England issues Bitcoin-backed bonds. By this point, Bitcoin exceeds $525,000. Phase V: A “New Bretton Woods” summit in Geneva restructures the U.S. dollar. The dollar gains 25% Bitcoin and 25% gold collateral , and the Fed launches a digital dollar (CBDC), expanding its balance sheet to $44 trillion. In this finale, Bitcoin reaches $600,000, gold $10,400, and oil $180 per barrel. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) drops to the high 60s. In other words, Krueger foresees an unprecedented reshuffling: global reserve currencies realign around BTC and gold. His scenario explicitly puts the dollar index around 68 and projects the S&P 500 roughly halving (a 50% drop from current levels). Krueger’s scenario is highly controversial. It depends on a chain of severe crises that have not occurred. The “$600K prediction” is still viewed as speculative and even “controversial”. Nonetheless, it has sparked discussion online about what market or policy events could set off the proposed rally. Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory For context, Bitcoin price has indeed been rallying in mid-2025. After briefly dipping to just above $100,000 in mid-May, BTC quickly rebounded above $103,000. BTC/USDT Price Chart| Source: TradingView By May 21, it traded around $107–108K, a 14% gain since the start of May. In this rally, the total crypto market capitalization climbed past $3.36 trillion. Despite these gains, Bitcoin remains below its January 2025 all-time high ($109,000). Traders note that the uptrend has formed a bullish flag pattern, with key resistance in the $112k—$120k range. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is $108,352, having climbed 3% over the last 24 hours. It has a trading volume of $67 billion. The market is also digesting macro factors (Fed policy, tariffs, etc.) that could fuel or cap the rally. In short, Bitcoin’s current momentum is strong, but many analysts view further moves as contingent on traditional-market dynamics. PHASE V: THE RESET (Week 12–13) Monday, October 6 U.S. declares emergency “New Bretton Woods” summit in Geneva.

The major breakthrough seems to have been caused by a rise in adoption. With this, the star token has become a $2 trillion asset, as the first price discovery correction after the first price discovery uptrend seems to have completed. The BTC price has confirmed a breakout above the final resistance below the ATH, and hence, the current discovery phase is expected to prevail for a long time. In times when retail traders remain uncertain about the next Bitcoin move, the whales are extremely confident. As per some reports, the 40X BTC whale, James Wynn, has just increased his long position to $1 billion. The Wynn’s conviction looks fueled by record BTC ETF inflows, a wave of profitable holders and relentless bullish chatter. With this, the Open interest (OI) has marked a new ATH, rising by $13 billion on Binance. The rise in the open interest suggests a rise in the total number of outstanding Bitcoin futures or options contracts. This also indicates a rise in the liquidity and volatility within the markets. The BTC price underwent a V-shaped recovery and surged above the final resistance zone, which has pushed the price into the discovery phase. The BTC price just surged above the final resistance level while the 50/200-day MAs is heading towards a bullish crossover or Golden Cross. On the other hand, the +Di & -Di were heading for a bearish crossover, but the latest rise in the price has triggered a bullish divergence. This validates the beginning of a fresh ascending trend, which could keep the price within the discovery phase for a long time. The Bitcoin price has broken its all-time high after 121 days and has also set records in its market capitalization and realized cap.

After breaking through key resistance levels at $0.725 and $0.732, Cardano ( ADA ) is now testing the $0.76 zone, with bullish momentum supported by a MACD crossover and reclaiming of the 50-EMA, according to crypto.news data . Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to an all-time high , which could significantly drive Cardano’s price, especially with its recent integration of Bitcoin support through its Lace wallet. This move enables BTC storage and interaction on Cardano, marking a major step in the project’s multichain strategy and unlocking new DeFi use cases. Investor confidence is also reflected in the nearly $1 billion in ADA withdrawn from centralized exchanges since early 2025, a pattern reminiscent of the lead-up to ADA’s all-time high in 2021.

2025-05-21T17:19:16.000Z,"Solana ETF Discussions Continue as Bitcoin Solaris Offers ‘Bitcoin Ground Floor’ Investment Potential","As crypto markets stir with Discussions of a potential Solana ETF, excitement is high—but so are the prices. While institutional investors shift their focus to top-tier blockchains, retail investors are asking a different question: where is the next true ground floor opportunity? Enter Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), the project that might offer investors exactly that—a second shot at early-Bitcoin-style wealth. Solana’s Momentum, But Not Its Price Point Solana continues to dominate headlines, especially with ongoing talks of a Solana ETF. Its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low costs have made it a favorite among developers and traders alike. However, Solana’s success comes with a price—literally. Many retail investors missed the early wave, and now, with institutions circling, the room for explosive growth may be limited for the average buyer. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris is carving out a new path for wealth creation, one that’s open, accessible, and still incredibly early. The Rise of Bitcoin Solaris Bitcoin Solaris has entered the scene with powerfully efficient architecture, pairing Bitcoin’s legendary Proof-of-Work security with Delegated Proof-of-Stake to enable next-generation speed and scale. Key blockchain features: 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) 2-second finality 99.95% less energy consumption than Bitcoin Dual consensus (PoW + DPoS) This hybrid design solves the blockchain trilemma—achieving security, decentralization, and scalability in a single network. But the true magic of Bitcoin Solaris lies in its ability to empower everyday users, not just developers or institutions. ‘Bitcoin Ground Floor’ Potential — In Your Pocket Imagine mining a next-generation crypto not with bulky rigs, but with a smartphone. Bitcoin Solaris is making that real. With its Solaris Nova App (currently in beta access for selected community members), users can mine BTC-S with: Smartphones (iOS/Android) Laptops and desktop PCs Traditional mining hardware (ASICs/GPUs) No technical knowledge? No problem. One-tap mining, cross-platform access, and a built-in wallet mean anyone, anywhere can join the network and begin earning. Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed And it doesn’t stop at mining. Bitcoin Solaris also offers liquid staking, letting users earn rewards while keeping their assets fully liquid. Users receive sBTC-S tokens (1:1) that can be used in lending, DeFi apps, or simply held for future value—no lockups, no limitations. Presale Phase 4 – Last Call Before Liftoff Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% The BTC-S presale is in its fourth phase, with early momentum reaching new highs. Already over $1,000,000 has been raised and more than 8,900 unique users have joined the movement. This 90-day presale ends on July 31, 2025, leaving only a narrow window to enter what many are calling the next Bitcoin-style opportunity. With a potential return of 1,900%, this is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market today. What the Crypto World Is Saying The buzz is real. Crypto influencers are paying attention—and for good reason. In a recent breakdown, Crypto Nitro explained why Bitcoin Solaris is one of the most promising projects in the space right now. With its combination of affordability, functionality, and accessibility, it’s quickly becoming the talk of multiple communities. Even platforms like Telegram and X are seeing surges in user activity as more investors begin to take notice. Audited and KYC-Verified Of course, safety and trust matter too. Bitcoin Solaris has been fully audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and the team behind the project has also passed KYC verification . It’s the kind of transparency serious investors demand—and Bitcoin Solaris delivers it without compromise. Conclusion As Solana ETF buzz grows, smart investors are turning to Bitcoin Solaris for what’s next. With mobile mining, fast transactions, and clean energy, BTC-S offers a powerful all-in-one crypto experience. More importantly, it’s still early. While others chase overhyped tokens, BTC-S gives early adopters a rare ground-floor shot—but with the presale phase ending soon, that window is closing fast.

Related News: BREAKING: Bitcoin Hits All-Time High Price Record - Celebration in the Air Solana Labs co-founder and CEO Anatoly Yakovenko said that TEEPIN represents a new phase in mobile technology: “TEEPIN provides a framework where trust is not granted by a central authority but verified by cryptography. By leveraging the secure hardware in existing smartphones and on-chain governance, we are opening the door to open innovation, platform ownership, and a decentralized mobile future.” The newly introduced SKR token will serve functions such as economic incentives, ownership, and governance within the Solana Mobile ecosystem. According to the team, SKR will be distributed directly to developers and users. The phones previously released by Solana developers became extremely popular due to the airdrop rewards they were entitled to.

2025-05-21T17:07:47.000Z,"Who Owns the Most Bitcoin?","The question of who owns the most Bitcoin is both simple and deeply complex. At the surface, blockchain transparency means anyone can see the largest wallets. But behind those cryptographic addresses lie a mix of anonymous creators, corporate giants, governments, and investment funds whose collective holdings shape the fate of the world’s first and most valuable cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin's King: Satoshi Nakamoto At the top of every list sits a name shrouded in mystery: Satoshi Nakamoto. Widely recognized as the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Nakamoto is estimated to hold between 1 million and 1.1 million BTC, making him the single largest holder of the cryptocurrency by a significant margin. These coins were mined in Bitcoin’s earliest days, spread across thousands of addresses, and have remained untouched since Nakamoto’s disappearance from public life in 2010. This immense fortune, worth over $68 billion at May 2024 prices has never been moved, spent, or sold. As a result, many analysts consider these coins effectively “out of circulation.” If even a fraction of Nakamoto’s stash were to move, it would send shockwaves through the market, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s price and investor sentiment. Institutional Titans: ETFs and BlackRock While Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings remain frozen, a new class of Bitcoin giants has emerged: institutional investment vehicles, particularly exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In 2024, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States fundamentally changed the landscape of Bitcoin ownership. By May 2025, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively held over 1.1 million BTC surpassing even Nakamoto’s legendary stash and accounting for more than 5% of all Bitcoin in existence. The largest among them is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which alone controls over 636,000 BTC, making it the second-largest single holder after Nakamoto and the largest institutional holder. IBIT’s meteoric rise has been fueled by surging demand from both retail and institutional investors seeking regulated, mainstream exposure to Bitcoin. ETF analysts suggest that if this trend continues, IBIT could soon eclipse even Nakamoto’s holdings, especially if Bitcoin’s price approaches new highs and institutional inflows accelerate. Binance and the Power of Custody Crypto exchanges are another major force in the Bitcoin ownership hierarchy. Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, holds between 633,000 and 647,000 BTC in custodial wallets as of 2025. While these assets technically belong to millions of users, the concentration of such a vast amount of Bitcoin under a single entity’s control gives exchanges like Binance enormous influence over market liquidity and stability. Other exchanges, such as Bitfinex and Kraken, also feature among the top holders, each managing hundreds of thousands of BTC on behalf of their users. Corporate Whales: MicroStrategy and Beyond MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin accumulation. As of 2025, the company holds between 214,000 and 244,800 BTC by far the largest treasury of any public company. Saylor himself is a notable individual holder, reportedly owning over 17,000 BTC personally. MicroStrategy’s aggressive strategy — raising capital to buy more Bitcoin has inspired other corporations to follow suit, including Tesla, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Block.one. These corporate actions have contributed to Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as a treasury asset and hedge against inflation. Governments: From Seizures to Strategic Holdings Governments have also become significant Bitcoin holders, primarily through law enforcement seizures. The U.S. government, following high-profile confiscations from criminal cases such as Silk Road and Bitfinex, now controls over 205,000 BTC. China, despite its ban on crypto trading, reportedly holds around 194,000 BTC seized from various operations. Bulgaria is another surprising entrant, with reports suggesting it holds over 213,000 BTC potentially making it one of the world’s largest sovereign holders, though the status of these coins remains unclear. The Early Adopters and Individual Whales A handful of early adopters and investors have also amassed legendary fortunes. The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, are estimated to hold around 70,000 BTC each, stemming from their early belief in Bitcoin’s potential. Venture capitalist Tim Draper famously bought 30,000 BTC at a U.S. government auction in 2014 and is believed to have added to his position since. Other so-called “whales”: individuals or entities holding more than 1,000 BTC make up a significant but opaque portion of the market. Many of these early miners and anonymous investors have never revealed their identities, and their coins often remain dormant for years. Why Does It Matter Who Owns the Most Bitcoin? The distribution of Bitcoin ownership has profound implications for the market: Large holders often called “whales” can move markets with a single transaction. Their buying or selling decisions can trigger price swings, impacting retail investors and institutional portfolios alike. The presence of long-term holders, such as Satoshi and early miners, whose coins remain untouched, is often seen as a sign of confidence in Bitcoin’s future. The rise of ETFs and corporate treasuries signals growing mainstream acceptance, potentially stabilizing Bitcoin’s price and broadening its investor base. While blockchain data makes it possible to track large wallets, the true identity behind many addresses remains unknown, adding an element of intrigue and risk to the market. Conclusion Bitcoin’s ownership is more concentrated than many realize, with a handful of entities: some anonymous, some corporate, some governmental controlling vast portions of the total supply. As institutional adoption accelerates and regulatory frameworks evolve, the list of top holders will continue to shift. Yet, for now, Satoshi Nakamoto’s untouched fortune remains the stuff of legend, a silent testament to Bitcoin’s origins and the enduring mystery at the heart of the world’s most valuable digital asset.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9216/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T17:07:41.000Z,"Binance enables PIX payments in Brazil using cryptocurrencies","Exchange Binance revealed the integration of Brazil’s PIX system with its cryptocurrency platform, allowing users to make payments in the local currency (BRL) using digital assets, such as Bitcoin, in real time. According to local media outlet E Investidor, this means that people and businesses all over Brazil can be paid by Binance users through PIX , the national instant payment system. With this integration, those with a Binance account can convert their crypto balance into BRL in an instant, practically facilitating instantaneous transactions. This is a significant step towards integrating traditional financial and digital assets within Latin America’s largest economy. From Bitcoin to everyday purchases This service allows Binance users in Brazil to pay for a variety of common items, like groceries, gas, school fees, and coffee, directly using cryptocurrency. The transaction procedure automatically converts the selected crypto asset into Brazilian real (1 Real = 0.18 US dollar) at the time of payment, eliminating the need for pre-conversion or third-party services. The move aims to make it easier to employ cryptocurrency in practical, real-world applications. By connecting Binance’s crypto ecosystem to the national payments infrastructure, the exchange hopes to increase the adoption of digital currencies in the region. “The integration is a simple and inclusive way to bring cryptocurrencies into everyday use, from coffee to school bills, from gas to groceries,” said Guilherme Nazar, Binance’s Regional VP for Latin America. Strategic expansion in Latin America The launch marks a continuation of Binance’s efforts to expand its foothold in Latin America, a region that is witnessing rapid growth in the crypto sector. Brazil, above all, has become a target market due to its large population, already existing fintech industry, and crypto-friendly ecosystem. The company is stressing the inclusive nature of this integration, calling it a catalyst for financial inclusion. With PIX being adopted by more than 140 million Brazilians, the integration of this system with the Binance platform starts to facilitate access to digital currencies for the population. According to Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, “this synergy empowers users with real-time and hassle-free transactions, enhancing the cryptocurrency experience and driving financial inclusion to new heights.” Regulatory considerations remain unclear Despite technological development, regulatory clarity is still a work in progress. Brazil’s Central Bank has recommended designating cryptocurrency exchanges for real as foreign exchange operations. If implemented, this classification would result in the imposition of the Tax on Financial Transactions (IOF), which applies to traditional currency exchanges. This possible taxing scheme is currently subject to public consultation, and no final decision has been made. As a result, it is unclear if consumers converting cryptocurrency to Brazil’s real for ordinary purchases may face additional taxes under the new classification. Boosting financial inclusion through innovation Binance is touting it as a key step toward improving financial inclusion. Integrating PIX with cryptocurrency payments will introduce users to digital finance and break technical and transactional barriers, regardless of banking status, they added. This innovation could do wonders in a country where millions are still underbanked or unbanked by traditional banks. Having crypto as a direct method of payment through a more widely used system like PIX would create an intersection between digital assets and everyday financial needs. Looking ahead While the entire significance of the move will rely on legal developments and user uptake, Binance’s PIX integration is a clear indication of the company’s desire to integrate cryptocurrencies deeper into Brazilians’ daily financial lives. Binance is seeking to transform digital currency from a speculative asset to a useful tool for daily transactions by integrating a global exchange platform with a national payment system. As the legal framework evolves, the success of this project could establish a precedent for other countries looking to integrate cryptocurrency into their existing financial institutions. For the time being, Binance sees Brazil as a testing ground for the future of real-time cryptocurrency payments.

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways : Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals. The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops. Bitcoin ( BTC ) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly. Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up. Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: Glassnode However, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations . So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession? Bitcoin cycle top markers Several technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak. The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely. The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in. Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend. BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, Glassnode Additionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum. BTC/USD 1-day, OBV. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingView Profit-taking metrics As market cycle tops approach, long-term holders and Bitcoin miners often start locking in profits. Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows. The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops. Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, Glassnode Individually, these indicators can mark various shifts in market trends. Combined, they often align with cycle tops. Related: Sorry bears — Bitcoin analysis dismisses $107K BTC price double top The 15% rule Historic price activity observations might come in handy, too. Crypto market analyst Cole Garner shared his exit playbook based on whales’ behavior. His roadmap includes three steps: Euphoria. Bitcoin moves vertically for weeks, with massive $10,000+ daily candles. Whiplash. Bitcoin experiences its sharpest correction of the bull cycle. The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer. Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point. According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well. Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems. Source: Cole Garner No single indicator can pinpoint the exact moment to exit, especially in a shifting macro environment. But when multiple signals align, they become hard to ignore.

Hassett says in a new interview with Fox Business that US debt “is the safest bet on Earth.” “There’s no country’s debt that I’d rather have than the United States’, and so Moody’s can do what it wants to. As Secretary Bessent said, it’s a backward-looking thing, penalizing us for all the reckless spending of the Biden Administration. But we’re cutting spending, we’re deregulating, we’ve got supply-side growth, and so we’ve got every reason in the world to believe that we’re going to have the best economy on Earth. And if you have the best economy on Earth, you’re going to have the best debt on Earth too.” Moody’s downgraded America’s credit rating from AAA to AA1 while changing the country’s outlook from negative to stable. The credit rating agency cited the United States’ soaring national debt and interest payment ratios that exceed those of other countries with the same credit rating. The decision stripped the US of its final Triple-A credit rating: in 2011, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) lowered the US rating from AAA to AA+ due to concerns over the government’s inability to address rising debt levels. In 2023, Fitch Ratings followed suit, citing persistent budget deficits and political infighting as key drivers of the downgrade.

Pepe’s Charts Look Greener than the Frog Himself On the price chart below, Pepe is showing continued strength after a massive weekend rally, with price action consolidating just below the recent local high. Whale accumulation between Thursday and Saturday sent the token soaring by 78% in just two days, triggering a breakout from a long-standing descending wedge. That explosive move pushed PEPE into a steep uptrend — one that’s now pausing for breath. The RSI has cooled slightly from overbought levels and is currently sitting around 66.87, suggesting the market is digesting gains without triggering heavy selling pressure. PEPE has added another 11.4% in the past 24 hours and is now trading 82% higher than it was this time last month — with most of those gains concentrated in the recent breakout. If momentum continues and bulls maintain control, PEPE could climb past $0.000025 to set a new six-month high — opening the door for a run toward its previous all-time high above $0.000028.

At the same time, BNB Chain’s business and trading hub, THENA, prepares for its V3,3 upgrade, scheduled to go live tomorrow, May 22. The upcoming upgrade aims to transform how governance, rewards, and liquidity operate in decentralized finance (DeFi). THENA @ThenaFi_ · Follow 1/ THENA is about to go through its biggest upgrade yet. V3,3 will be live with new UI and voting later tonight.It brings modularity, automated rewards, and custom strategies. Built for capital efficiency with all stakeholders in mind.Read our blog or the thread below to 4:03 PM · May 21, 2025 122 Reply Copy link Read 15 replies Amidst bullish ecosystem developments, attention has shifted to charts. One analyst highlighted possible THE/USD bullish reversals. Notably, the alt has secured reliable support at $0.21 – $0.24 on the 4H chart after extended declines. A rebound from this foothold could propel THE to the target of $0.68, translating to an approximately 120% surge from current prices of $0.3105. THENA’s V3.3 upgrade: what’s new? THENA is a BNB Chain-based liquidity layer and DEX that offers perpetual and spot trading for various assets. THE Liquidity Marketplace, which utilizes the ve(3,3) model, is at the center of the THENA ecosystem. With the latest upgrade, THENA aims to transform DeFi governance and liquidity management, aligning with its goal of a modular and self-optimized network. The announcement indicated: “With V3,3, THENA becomes faster, more agile, and more flexible than ever. From governance to liquidity provision (LP) mechanics, the system is primed for long-term scalability and sustainability.” Meanwhile, the update introduces Plugins – modular smart contract features that allow liquidity pools to fine-tune dynamically depending on prevailing market conditions. The Plugins include volatility-linked fees that adjust based on market movements and sliding fee scales, offering a supple pricing model. Moreover, users can brace for the upcoming Brevis ZK Plugin that leverages zk (zero-knowledge) proofs to offer fee discounts based on user identity. The Plugins resemble Uniswap’s “hooks,” which launched with the V4 upgrade early this year . Furthermore, THENA’s V3.3 upgrade launched a Unified Gauge System. The update enables manual CLPs (concentrated liquidity providers) to stake non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and earn THE rewards. THE price outlook: Is a 120% move impending? The native token appears ripe for bullish breakouts as the blockchain prepares for the key upgrade. THE changes hands at $0.3105, ready for an explosive surge. Crypto trader James Melville shared a 4H THE/USDT price chart highlighting a persistent decline from late 2024. Source – James Melville on X That saw the alt plummeting from $5 with lower lows and lower highs inside a descending channel. Nevertheless, the latest price action indicates a possible momentum shift to the upside. THENA has secured a reliable support floor at the $0.21 – $0.24 range. The alt has tested this level several times, and buyers have joined to defend it every time. THE’s current price of $0.3105 places it inside the descending trendline, with consolidation signaling possible bullish breakouts. Breaching the trendline resistance might trigger rallies to the chart’s target of $0.68, a 119% gain from current prices. However, the $0.21 support remains vital for THE/USD. Losing this barrier will cancel the bullish pattern and welcome bearish price actions. The current market sentiments, as Bitcoin eyes a closing above $110K, support THENA’s bullish trajectory.

2025-05-21T16:45:27.000Z,"Circle Seeking at Least $5,000,000,000 for Coinbase Acquisition, Potentially Nixing IPO Plans: Report","Ripple and Coinbase have both reportedly participated in informal talks to acquire the stablecoin issuer Circle. Fortune, citing four anonymous banking and private equity executives, reports that Circle wants at least $5 billion for a sale. The USDC issuer has been gearing up for an initial public offering (IPO), but the firm would reportedly scuttle those plans should an acquisition materialize. The stablecoin giant filed an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month. Circle initially announced plans to go public back in 2021, via a merger with Concord Acquisition Corp, a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Those plans were called off in December 2022. Circle and Coinbase already have a long history: The firms co-created USDC in 2018 and jointly managed the asset through the Centre Consortium until 2023. That year, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire announced that his company would bring all of USDC’s governance and operations responsibilities in-house to streamline management of the stablecoin. Coinbase said at the time that it would purchase an equity stake in Circle, and the stablecoin issuer’s April S-1 registration statement indicates the top US crypto exchange receives revenue generated from USDC reserves. Coinbase became a public company in April 2021. Ripple already submitted an offer to purchase Circle with a bid of $4-5 billion, but the stablecoin issuer rejected the number, Fortune reports.

2025-05-21T16:37:24.000Z,"Portal to Bitcoin Unveils the First Custody-free Bitcoin-Secured Cross-Chain Stack built on Babylon Genesis","USA – May 2025 — Portal to Bitcoin , a decentralized finance (DeFi) technology company, today announced a strategic integration with Babylon Genesis, the pioneer of trustless Bitcoin staking. Now available is the industry’s first modular, fully custody-less cross-chain infrastructure stack. This solution is purpose-built to scale DeFi on the bedrock of Bitcoin security. Through Babylon Genesis’s staking and timestamping protocols and Portal’s BitScaler-powered Channel Factory, Bitcoin holders can now secure proof-of-stake (PoS) validators with native BTC, execute instant bridgeless atomic swaps between BTC and assets such as ETH and SOL, and record validator signatures and decentralized exchange (DEX) trades immutably on the Bitcoin network. Chandra Duggirala, Co-founder and CEO of Portal to Bitcoin, added: “Portal is changing the Bitcoin blockspace into the settlement engine for millions of markets — from real-world assets (RWAs) to Web2 equities. Babylon Genesis's timestamping extends out the notary chain with the full weight of Bitcoin’s security guarantees.” Historically, Bitcoin’s role in DeFi has been limited by custodial bridges and wrapped tokens like Wrapped BTC (WBTC). The Portal-to-Bitcoin integration with Babylon Genesis eliminates those barriers. Native BTC can now be staked directly on PoS networks, traded across chains without synthetic representations, and used to finalize transactions with Bitcoin’s unchallenged immutability. “Portal’s integration with Babylon Genesis shows that Bitcoin can serve as both the capital and the consensus layer for a new generation of cross-chain applications,” said Clayton Menzel, Head of Business Development at Babylon Labs. “By anchoring activity to Bitcoin, builders are no longer limited to choosing either composability or self-custody.” Portal and Babylon Genesis share a design philosophy prioritizing user sovereignty over everything else. Portal employs a Layer 3 (L3) notary chain anchored to Bitcoin, while Babylon Genesis uses covenant emulation and EOTS-based slashing to guarantee staked BTC cannot be misappropriated. By leveraging cryptographic enforcement, Portal to Bitcoin and Babylon Genesis extend Bitcoin’s security measures to every connected chain, eliminating intermediaries. About Portal to Bitcoin Portal to Bitcoin is a custodyless L3 protocol that enables native atomic swaps between Bitcoin and other blockchains. Built on the BitScaler architecture, Portal facilitates secure and fast self-custodial trading without bridges, wrapped assets, or third-party custody. About Babylon Labs Babylon Labs develops Bitcoin security-sharing protocols to build a decentralized world secured by Bitcoin. Its key product is the first trustless Bitcoin staking protocol, allowing BTC holders to earn staking rewards on PoS chains without relinquishing custody, using bridges, or minting wrapped tokens.

2025-05-21T16:29:57.000Z,"Bitcoin hits all-time high, traders brace for breakout above $110K, WIF top gainer","Bullish momentum returned as Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $109,000, rebounding from the previous day’s low of $104,200. The rally sparked broader gains across the cryptocurrency market, lifting total market capitalisation above $3.5 trillion for the first time since early February. Investor sentiment stayed strong, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 70, firmly in “Greed” territory. In the altcoin market, gains were mostly concentrated in low-cap tokens, while major cryptocurrencies posted more modest gains. Will Bitcoin price increase? With Bitcoin dominance at 63.1%, hovering below the key $108,000 resistance, traders are closely watching for signs of a breakout. Bitcoin futures open interest has surged to a record high of over $78 billion, according to Coinglass data, rising more than 11% in the past 24 hours alone. The build-up in leveraged exposure suggests traders are positioning for significant upside. Liquidation heatmaps show a dense cluster of short positions just above $108,000, with further liquidity bands visible above the $110,000 mark. BTC/USDT 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: Glassnode. If BTC clears this near-term resistance, it could trigger a powerful short squeeze, forcing bearish positions to unwind and fueling further upside momentum. Continued institutional inflows further reinforce this scenario. Over the past two days, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded nearly $1 billion in fresh capital. The steady demand from institutional players is providing a solid foundation for Bitcoin’s price, even amid elevated leverage. While the risk of a near-term correction persists, especially in such a leveraged environment, the current setup favours the bulls. A clean break above $108,000 could open the door to price discovery, with the $110,000–$112,000 zone emerging as the next key area to watch. According to renowned trader and investor Arthur Hayes, the $110,000 level marks a key psychological resistance, one that, if breached, could pave the way for an extended rally towards $150,000–$200,000 by the end of this cycle. On shorter time frames, analysts say a new all-time high may be imminent. Popular trader AlphaBTC noted that Bitcoin has been trading within an ascending channel since its recovery began on April 9. In a May 21 post, he said the setup points to an imminent breakout, with the asset having reclaimed its previous all-time high. BTC/USD 12-hour chart. Source: AlphaBTC The next resistance lies just above, but AlphaBTC expects this to be cleared soon, citing the “grind and pop” pattern, where larger players use repeated shorting activity by bears to gradually push prices higher. If the breakout materialises, he expects Bitcoin to target $115,000 in the near term. MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe echoed a similar sentiment as he speculated a cycle high of $200,000, basing his thesis on growing distrust in fiat currencies. In a May 20 post, he said Bitcoin is heading to an all-time high “faster than expected,” as more people move away from the constant devaluation of the U.S. dollar. According to van de Poppe, this structural shift in capital preference could drive sustained demand, pushing BTC far beyond its current range and extending the rally well into six-figure territory. Meanwhile, Mags, tracking Bitcoin’s historical halving performance, expects the current uptrend to culminate in a new cycle high near $215,000, potentially making it the most significant bull run to date.

TRUMP is now up by 7% in a week and by an impressive 70% in the last 30 days, although the altcoin – the 50th biggest token in the market – remains down by 80% in comparison to its January ATH of $73.43. It has posted strong gains recently because of the dinner President Donald Trump will hold tomorrow, with this dinner being open to the 220 biggest holders of TRUMP. However, even if there’s a short-term “sell the news” event following the dinner, Trump Coin may still rally higher in the long term, especially as broader market momentum builds and upcoming events continue to drive interest in politically themed tokens. Trump Coin Price Prediction: May 22 Lunch Could Trigger the Most Insane Meme Pump of 2025 Taking place tomorrow at Trump’s golf club in Virginia, the lunch will see the anonymous owners of 220 TRUMP wallets dine with the President.

The nature of the pseudonymous wallets raises questions about the true identities and motivations of the… pic.twitter.com/66VtpRQg34 — Doge from Wall Street (@DOGEfromWS) May 18, 2025 The identities of at least some of the wallets above are already clear, with Justin Sun revealing in the past 24 hours that he is the owner of the wallet with the most holdings. A report from Bloomberg suggests that 19 out of the top 25 holders are not American, while Trump’s critics in Washington have accused the President of corruption and of exposing himself to foreign influence. So far, however, the dinner has had a positive effect on TRUMP’s price, although it may become a little more unpredictable after May 22. Looking at its chart today, TRUMP appears to be on the verge of a breakout, with its 4-hour chart showing the token pressing against the upper boundary of a symmetrical triangle — a classic pattern that often precedes explosive moves. The RSI has surged to 71.75, indicating strong bullish momentum and suggesting that buying pressure is building rapidly. The RSI is currently hovering around 71.75, entering overbought territory — a sign of strong bullish momentum, though also suggesting the potential for short-term volatility. Volume is beginning to tick higher, which could provide the confirmation bulls need to push the token into its next rally phase. If market sentiment holds, TRUMP may be on track to retest its yearly highs and push toward $30 by early summer. Alternative Altcoin with Stronger Fundamentals Given the risk that the Trump Coin price could slip after tomorrow, some traders may opt to invest in other alts, particularly those with more solid fundamentals. Finding such tokens can be difficult, but one interesting new coin that does offer strong tokenomics and a real sense of future growth is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) , which has now raised $6 million in its presale. Send it higher! #BTC pic.twitter.com/cFMg2kM7dk — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 20, 2025 As its name might suggest, Bitcoin Bull has attached its tokenomics to Bitcoin (BTC) itself, with the coin scheduling events to coincide with BTC reaching new price milestones. On the one hand, it will burn a portion of its total support (21 billion BTCBULL) whenever BTC reaches a new $25,000 milestone, beginning with $125,000. On the other hand, it will also conduct airdrops of Bitcoin whenever BTC reaches a new $50,000 milestone, beginning with $150,000. And given that it has a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, such burns and drops could put considerable upwards pressure on its price over time. As could the fact that holders can stake the token for passive income, something which could send demand even higher. While there isn’t long left before its sale ends, latecomers can join by visiting the Bitcoin Bull website . BTCBULL is now selling at $0.00252, but this will rise again in three days, so investors should act quickly.

2025-05-21T16:20:16.000Z,"Avalanche price prediction 2025-2031: Time to buy AVAX?","Key takeaways: Our Avalanche price prediction anticipates a high of $33.36 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $23.19 Market cap $9.76B Trading volume $18.94M Circulating supply 420.88M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $22.99 24-hour low $21.80 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.26% 50-day SMA $21.01 200-day SMA $26.24 Sentiment Neutral Green days 14/30 (47%) Avalanche price analysis As of May 21, AVAX’s price rose by 3.24% in 24 hours and 10.50% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume grew by 13.83% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last week, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to as high as $26.84. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility has dropped. The relative strength index is at 58.56 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing negative market momentum. It is considered overbought when the RSI value rises above 70. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which has broken out upwards. Earlier, it had risen to $26.84 before correcting. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 46.56. The William Alligator trendlines show little market volatility.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is in consolidation and shows signs of rising over the short term. Recent news VanEck has said it will launch the PurposeBuilt Fund in June to invest in tokenized businesses on the Avalanche blockchain. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Image source: CoinStats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by May, it had fallen below $20.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/avalanche-price-prediction/,"AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ICO|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|avax",cryptocompare

2025-05-21T16:13:28.000Z,"New CoinMarketCap Crypto AI Sends Altcoins like MIND of Pepe to the Moon","CoinMarketCap has unveiled its latest AI-powered assistant, CMC AI, that will serve up a set of predefined questions and answers on price movements, token fundamentals, and sentiment with a single click on all major token pages. For instance, if you’re viewing Bitcoin on CoinMarketCap , you’ll see questions like ‘ Why is $BTC’s price up? ’ ‘ What could affect $BTC’s future price? ’ or ‘ What are people saying about $BTC? ’ All you need to do is click on one of these questions to get a detailed analysis. This is a prime example of how AI agents and tech are shaping real-world experiences. Keep reading to learn more about how this feature works and how it could simplify crypto investing for you. We’ll also suggest a similar AI agent token ( MIND of Pepe ) you can invest in to make the most of the upcoming AI investment era. How Does CMC AI Work? The CMC AI interacts with a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI and feeds it a prompt that includes the latest price data of various tokens. When you click on the pre-generated questions, you’re essentially seeing the response generated by the LLM based on the prompt provided to it by CoinMarketCap. Simply put, CoinMarketCap asks the LLM questions about a given token, and the responses are linked in the CMC AI section on the token’s detail page. For major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the answers are updated every 30 minutes. For other tokens, however, updates will roll out if the price moves more than 2% in an hour. Our AI is purpose-built for crypto, trained on our extensive market data, and designed to surface insights when users need clarity about specific cryptocurrencies. – David Salamon, Chief Product Officer at CoinMarketCap. The biggest benefit of CMC AI is that it reduces repeated search queries on these LLMs. For example, millions of investors would want to ask ChatGPT, ‘ Why is the bitcoin price going up? ’ This leads to a lot of API calls and LLM running costs. With CMC AI, such repeated requests can be eliminated, resulting in large-scale cost savings. This is Just the Beginning It’s worth noting that CMC AI’s initial rollout is only the first phase of CoinMarketCap’s host of planned AI updates, which will gradually roll out throughout 2025. Upcoming features include trending market data on the CoinMarketCap homepage, custom question answers with conversational AI LLM tools, and personalized answers based on your watchlist, portfolio, and investment interests. This is only the beginning of how AI models and AI agents are going to change the future of cryptocurrency and the Web3 space. AI agents are rapidly finding new applications and making their way into real-world scenarios. The AI agent market cap today stands at $7.22B, but it’s expected to cross the $10B mark soon. If you want to make the most of this potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, we’ve got something perfect for you: MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . What is MIND of Pepe ($MIND)? Don’t mistake MIND of Pepe for just another AI assistant. It’s a never-before-seen intelligent AI agent built from the ground up to identify the next cryptos to explode , i.e., cheap presale tokens poised for growth. $MIND will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X. Unlike typical AI chatbots that feel sterile and boring to talk to, however, $MIND will serve up a user-friendly and context-aware tone, engaging crypto degens like never before. We were blown away when we found out that MIND of Pepe has also been programmed to understand crypto-native lingo, prevalent memes, and the overall mindset of the crypto trading community. Once it’s gathered the crypto community’s varying opinions on different tokens, $MIND will use its cutting-edge hive-mind analysis system to deliver actionable trading insights to its token holders. It’s worth noting that besides social sentiment, MIND of Pepe will also gather real-time on-chain activity and things like market data APIs to help it spot and connect everything relevant for the AI agent to offer good trading calls. Buy Some $MIND Now $MIND Will Also Be Self-Evolving In addition to being fully autonomous, MIND of Pepe will also be self-evolving. According to its whitepaper , $MIND will eventually even be able to create its own tokens. Seeing as $MIND will have access to CoinMarketCap, DexScreener, and Solana-specific metrics (like token creation, wallet activity, and early LP behavior), there’s really no arguing that $MIND’s own tokens could very well be in a pole position to become the next top trending cryptos . Buy the $MIND Presale to Ride the AI Agent’s Success The most significant piece of information we could give you today is that every single benefit related to MIND of Pepe will only be available to holders of the $MIND presale token. So, if you haven’t quite figured out meme coin investing – or you’d like to diversify your portfolio with one of the best AI agent coins – then become an early investor in $MIND . Luckily for you, the project is still in its presale. It’s gaining more and more attention and has raised nearly $10M in early investor funding, which is a testament to its revolutionary powers. Each token is currently available for just $0.0037515, but interested investors should really hurry up because the presale will end in less than 10 days from now. Our MIND of Pepe’s price prediction found it could easily be the next crypto to explode. According to our research, $MIND could reach $0.030 by the end of 2030. If this holds true, you could see a nearly 800x return on your investment. If this is your first time joining a crypto presale, here’s a detailed guide on how to buy MIND of Pepe .

2025-05-21T16:10:56.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as UK Ready to Regulate and Embrace Crypto","Despite lingering skepticism around digital currencies, momentum is clearly building across the globe. Crypto isn’t just surviving scrutiny—it’s steadily being woven into national agendas. While the United States has been the focal point of regulation and institutional involvement, other governments are no longer watching from the sidelines. The United Kingdom has now entered the conversation with clear intent. Far from a vague policy outline, the UK has announced concrete plans to regulate crypto firms by 2026, marking a pivotal shift in how the country approaches this asset class. This isn’t just about keeping pace—it’s about shaping rules that match the pace of adoption and ensuring oversight as public interest grows. About The UK’s 2026 Crypto Mandate The UK has set January 1, 2026 , as the official date when cryptocurrency firms will be required to comply with sweeping new data collection and reporting rules. These regulations are aligned with the OECD’s Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF), designed to standardize tax transparency on a global scale. The focus is clear—every firm operating in or serving users from the UK must collect granular information on each customer, ranging from names and addresses to tax IDs and transaction logs. This move signals more than just data tracking. It marks a growing expectation that crypto firms adopt the same rigor applied in traditional finance. Personal details—such as a user’s country of residence, tax reference numbers, and full address—must be gathered and verified. Business entities face an equally strict standard, including documentation of control structures in some cases. 📍🇬🇧From 1 January 2026 if you provide cryptoasset services in the UK, you’ll have new responsibilities for collecting data and reporting it to @HMRCgovuk .UK is introducing the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF), and extending it… pic.twitter.com/xmarqR8L7I — The British Blockchain Association (@Brit_blockchain) May 15, 2025 Firms that slip up could be penalized £300 per user for inaccurate or incomplete submissions. That alone has triggered an early wave of preparation across the sector, with HMRC advising firms to shore up internal systems well in advance. The FCA has also been active, rejecting a large portion of crypto firm applications in recent years, suggesting that oversight is already tightening. The agency is now weighing restrictions on crypto purchases made with credit, reinforcing the broader regulatory tone. Interestingly, the UK’s approach deviates from the EU’s MiCA framework. There are no plans to impose volume limits on stablecoin use, and foreign stablecoin issuers may be allowed to operate without local registration—choices that suggest the UK is pursuing a more flexible model. With public participation in crypto nearly doubling between 2022 and 2023, this regulatory overhaul is arriving at a time when more users than ever will be impacted. Best Crypto to Buy Now With Global Adoption Increasing SUBBD As more governments move toward stricter oversight of digital assets, platforms like SUBBD are positioned to thrive—not in defiance of regulation, but because they’re structured with accountability in mind. SUBBD is a creator-first crypto platform that gives influencers full autonomy over monetization while offering followers access to exclusive, token-gated content through the $SUBBD token. Its smart contract foundation is transparent and structured to track interactions and earnings precisely—something that aligns well with rising calls for crypto tax traceability and data transparency. The utility here is strong. For creators, SUBBD offers tools to launch premium content feeds, offer membership perks, and establish custom governance rules around community access. For fans, the token becomes more than a support badge—it’s a pass to meaningful experiences. This interaction layer is recorded on-chain, making it verifiable and structured in a way that lends itself well to the kind of compliance governments like the UK are now enforcing. As the UK aims to finalize crypto rules by 2026, projects that offer clear ownership trails, accurate user-level data, and real value exchange may fit more easily within that framework. SUBBD’s ecosystem already leans in this direction, and if broader adoption continues—especially among online creators migrating away from Web2 monetization platforms—it may very well stand to benefit from both user growth and regulatory readiness. BTC Bull BTC Bull builds on the original vision of Bitcoin but as a project created to support its growth. Built as a tribute to Bitcoin’s foundational ideals, the project introduces a memecoin with a community-first ethos and a staking system that rewards commitment. The project’s offering is simple—it offers airdrops to the holders every time Bitcoin reaches a price milestone. Its primary purpose is to incentivize long-term holding while celebrating Bitcoin’s cultural and financial influence. The staking model is one of the clearest expressions of its utility. Users are rewarded based on the amount and duration of their holdings, creating an ecosystem where participation becomes more valuable over time. This isn’t yield farming with unnecessary complexity—it’s designed to be verifiable, predictable, and secure. Projects with such clear, well-documented smart contract logic could be in a stronger position as the UK’s new mandates around data integrity and transaction tracking come into force. It is one of the most covered crypto presales too, on various social media platforms, with top content creators like ClayBro and many others also featuring and endorsing its potential in dedicated videos on their channels. Another reason BTC Bull fits this regulatory moment is its audit-backed foundation. At a time when tax authorities are tightening the grip on crypto transactions and user data, trustless systems backed by external reviews become harder to ignore. As adoption grows globally and policy frameworks expand, BTC Bull offers a case study in how memecoins can evolve—not just as viral assets, but as structured projects with well-defined value mechanics and transparent user participation. That shift matters more now than ever, especially as markets like the UK move toward clear regulatory enforcement. MIND of Pepe The speculative energy around memecoins hasn’t gone anywhere, but MIND of Pepe takes the concept a step further, turning it into something structurally smarter. At the core of this project is an AI agent designed to interact with social media trends, gauge audience sentiment, and relay that data back to token holders. In an environment where countries like the UK are beginning to mandate exact user data and transactional clarity, a token with built-in insight mechanisms becomes far more than a novelty. MIND of Pepe allows holders to access sentiment-driven signals gathered from major platforms like X. The AI behind it processes public chatter, aggregates mood shifts, and surfaces information that can help investors make smarter decisions. While that might sound playful at first, it’s built with serious infrastructure, including a secure token allocation, real-time analysis tools, and future plans to let users influence how the AI evolves. This project’s AI-agent architecture could offer surprising alignment with the incoming regulatory mindset. As tax agencies and regulators begin demanding granular reporting on transactions and even intent, MIND of Pepe’s built-in sentiment tracking could eventually help users better document the rationale behind their moves—whether for compliance purposes or smarter trading. It’s a rare thing when a meme project delivers utility that resonates beyond its humor. But in a crypto world being shaped by smart policy shifts and structured oversight, MIND of Pepe seems curiously well adapted for what comes next. Best Wallet Token With governments tightening their grip on digital asset reporting, the need for secure, multi-chain self-custody wallets is no longer optional—it’s foundational. Best Wallet, with its BEST presale , sits right in this emerging zone of necessity. It’s a decentralized, non-custodial crypto wallet supporting more than 60 blockchains, and it’s already equipped to handle the type of user-level transparency regulators are beginning to demand. Whether in the UK, which has set a clear date for enforcement, or elsewhere, platforms that proactively help users track, manage, and validate their activity will likely become essential tools. The utility here is dense. Best Wallet isn’t just a storage solution—it includes a native DEX, high-yield staking, portfolio tracking, presale discovery, and even in-app market intelligence. The $BEST token fuels this ecosystem, unlocking staking perks, early access features, and future governance participation. As regulators zero in on detailed transaction records and traceable crypto movement, Best Wallet’s real-time tracking and chain-level clarity are already a few steps ahead of the curve. What makes it particularly well-placed in this moment is its growing appeal among presale hunters and cross-chain investors—users who now find themselves increasingly in need of accurate activity logs and decentralized access. If the UK’s planned regulations nudge more users to seek platforms that simplify compliance without giving up privacy, Best Wallet may become one of the few tools capable of meeting both needs at once. Solaxy Built to enable seamless activity across Ethereum and Solana ecosystems, Solaxy’s real strength lies in its technical infrastructure. This is a Layer 2 solution designed for faster throughput, cheaper transactions, and built-in staking rewards through its native token, SOLX. As jurisdictions like the UK move toward deeper scrutiny of cross-border crypto activity, platforms that simplify user interactions across chains while maintaining data accuracy are stepping into the spotlight. Solaxy’s cross-chain architecture may well align with what this next era of crypto adoption demands. Unlike most Layer 2 networks that serve only a single chain, Solaxy operates as a dual-ecosystem facilitator. This means users don’t have to worry about bridge risks or fragmented liquidity pools when operating between Ethereum and Solana—a key feature for traders, developers, and stakers alike. We’re going interstellar! 🛸38M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/udfUBJ0GBC — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 20, 2025 Through SOLX, users can access yield programs, governance rights, and discounted network fees. And all interactions—staking, transfers, liquidity provision—are logged and traceable. If regulators across countries begin to implement frameworks similar to the UK’s CARF-aligned policy, cross-chain transparency will become a major filter for viable projects. Solaxy’s built-in data visibility, paired with its staking and governance models, helps reduce the fragmentation that often complicates compliance. Its infrastructure isn’t just built for speed—it’s built with traceability and scalability in mind, quietly addressing the exact issues many governments are now raising. Conclusion With the UK locking in a regulatory deadline and more countries taking similar steps, crypto projects will likely face increasing scrutiny over structure, function, and transparency. Early-stage tokens that already align with these expectations—or are building toward them—may have an advantage as compliance becomes non-negotiable. For investors, this shift highlights the importance of looking beyond hype and focusing on whether a project is built to operate within a more formalized system—with some good examples being projects listed above in this article.

2025-05-21T15:52:11.000Z,"The Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Explained and What BSR Means for the US Economy","The United States government is considering alternative “budget neutral” methods of funding its new bitcoin strategic reserve, creating lots of excitement worldwide in the cryptocurrency world. The radical shift in monetary policy—a reserve supply of bitcoin—dramatically changes how the U.S. approaches financial negotiations. This all comes after President Donald Trump's Executive Order of March 6, which established the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. His order put a freeze on any further sales of the U.S. 's bitcoin—a move some feel could ensure the U.S. becoming the dominant force in the worldwide cryptocurrency market. Our comprehensive analysis goes back to the origins of the U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve: we examine the economic rationale for the reserve and its potential implications. We also explore the legislative framework, its funding mechanisms, and the macroeconomic impact of the U.S.’s groundbreaking bitcoin initiative. There’s also some key concerns the reserve raises, and it has some limitations to consider. Let’s go! The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Origins and Legislative Framework Legislative efforts beginning back in mid-2024, mark both the origins of the bitcoin strategic reserve, and an incredibly significant shift in how the U.S. government views and handles digital assets. Unlike current traditional monetary policies, the bitcoin initiative represents a deliberate attempt to integrate cryptocurrency into the national financial strategy. The BITCOIN Act of 2024 and its core provisions Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming introduced The Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act in 2024, establishing the foundation for the U.S.’s national bitcoin policy. Her legislation aims to create a comprehensive framework for management of government bitcoin holdings by authorizing multiple key provisions: Establishment of a decentralized network of secure bitcoin storage facilities spread across multiple U.S. locations Implementation of purchasing program to purchase 200,000 over five years, totaling 1 million Acquisition of approximately 5% of the world’s total bitcoin supply—a goal mirroring U.S. gold reserves’ percentile Funding by diversifying existing resources already within the Federal Reserve System Protection of the rights of bitcoin holders to self-custody their asset without a third party Additionally, the legislation mandated that quarterly reports via an auditing practice known as \""proof of reserves\"" are maintained, which is to ensure transparency and accountability of government-held bitcoin’s management. Furthermore, the sale of bitcoin under federal control became prohibited by Trump’s March 6 executive order, requiring all bitcoin to be transferred to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve once legal title has been secured. President Trump's executive order and political motivations When Trump formalized the bitcoin strategic reserve via signature on the executive order titled \""Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,” the order directed the Treasury Department to establish an office to administer the reserve. Bitcoin seized through criminal and civil asset forfeiture proceedings and currently held by the government formed the strategic reserve’s initial capital. Trump’s executive order contained several key directives: Government-owned bitcoin would not be sold, but instead held as a reserve asset Both the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments were authorized to develop \""budget-neutral\"" strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin without tax dollars All federal agencies were required to provide a complete accounting of digital assets in their possession within 30 days A separate \""Digital Asset Stockpile\"" would be created for cryptocurrencies and digital assets other than bitcoin The initiative moves towards fulfillment of Trump’s various cryptocurrency-related campaign promises, including to make America \""the undisputed bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world.\"" According to Trump's digital assets advisor, aka “Crypto Czar David Sacks, previous government sales of approximately 195,000 bitcoin have cost taxpayers an estimated $17 billion in lost value. The reserve now represents an attempt to transform this perceived mismanagement into strategic advantage. Role of Senator Cynthia Lummis and state-level initiatives A years-long bitcoin advocate, Senator Cynthia Lummis emerged as the primary congressional spokesperson and champion of the bitcoin strategic reserve. She reintroduced the BITCOIN Act following Trump’s executive order to codify the initiative into permanent law. Lummis framed the reserve as addressing America's \""$36 trillion national debt\"" and strengthening the country's \""economic foundation for generations.\"" State-level initiatives are also gaining momentum. By early 2025, twenty-eight states had proposed allocating public funds to bitcoin, with eighteen actively progressing through legislative channels 6. Notable examples include: Texas: Considering Senate Bill 21 to create a state-managed investment fund for Bitcoin and high market cap cryptocurrencies 7 Kentucky: Enacted legal protections for Bitcoin users, exempting node operators from money transmitter licensing 6 Arizona: Advanced its Bitcoin Reserve Bill through the House Committee 6 Oklahoma: Passed House Bill 1203 establishing a state Bitcoin reserve by a 77-15 vote 6 The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal, operating under the authority of the state Comptroller, would be financed through legislative appropriations, dedicated revenue sources, and private donations 7. This initiative reflects growing interest in cryptocurrency as a potential hedge against inflation and economic volatility at both federal and state levels. Economic Rationale Behind a Bitcoin Reserve Beyond politics, economic justification for the bitcoin strategic reserve rests on three main ideas: inflation protection, reserve diversification, and debt reduction. These aspects form the foundation of what proponents describe as a forward-thinking monetary strategy. Bitcoin as a deflationary hedge against inflation The core economic rationale behind the bitcoin strategic reserve lies in its inherent design as a deflationary asset. With a permanently capped supply of 21 million, bitcoin stands in stark contrast to traditional fiat currency, which gets printed indefinitely, causing inflation. This artificial digital scarcity gives bitcoin intrinsic value and positions it as a potential shield against price and dollar depreciation. The only potential caveat at the moment, is how long it takes Bitcoin to send and receive , with some estimators ranging from 1 to 1.5 hours. Bitcoin's deflationary mechanisms, including a fixed supply and halving events reducing its issuance totals, make it resistant to inflationary norms. Bitcoin is widely considered a viable store of value, just like gold. Being a digital asset with proven scarcity and this hard limit means bitcoin could increase its value as demand rises worldwide, a counterbalance to the declining purchasing power of fiat currencies. Bitcoin notably operates independently of geopolitical tension and the economic policies typically affecting traditional assets. This independence provides a unique security layer for national reserves during periods of inflation, economic uncertainty or currency debasement. Diversification of U.S. national reserves For the federal reserve, bitcoin represents the opportunity to extend its portfolio beyond traditional assets like gold and foreign currencies. Diversifying into bitcoin offers the nation enhanced economic resilience through exposure to different asset classes, each of course with varying risk profiles. Holding, or “hodling,” bitcoin follows the same logic as maintaining national gold reserves, foreign currencies, and other assets. However, bitcoin offers many distinct advantages: 24/7 market liquidity, fast cross-border transactions, and lower transaction costs make bitcoin a highly flexible reserve asset 1. Despite its volatility, bitcoin's value has surged over 10,000% since inception, consistently outperforming every other traditional asset in existence. This growth potential makes bitcoin an attractive addition to the federal reserve bitcoin strategy, and some suggest it could be used to strengthen the dollar's role as the world’s reserve currency. Potential to reduce long-term federal debt burden Perhaps the most compelling reason for the reserve is bitcoin's potential impact on the U.S.’s national debt. Asset management firm VanEck projects that the U.S. establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve could cut the national debt by up to 35% by 2049. $42 trillion of the projected $119.3 trillion national debt in 2049 could be offset through this strategy, according to estimates from the firm. Optimistic assessments continue to come from Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) who believes a strategic bitcoin reserve could cut the national debt in half by 2045—a projection which aligns with analysis suggesting that if bitcoin growth continues to be strong, by 2045 the U.S. Treasury could reduce its federal debt by as much as $50.8 trillion. The mechanism for this debt reduction could involve innovative financial instruments like \""BitBonds,\"" which would allow the government to finance debt for around 1% interest instead, opposed to the typical 4.5% for 10-year Treasury notes—a shift which would translate to roughly $70 billion in savings annually, or $700 billion in the first decade. The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve represents more than a technological initiative, but proof of a burgeoning economic paradigm shift. Bitcoin offers inflation protection, reserve diversification, plus a pathway toward addressing America's substantial debt—all without taxpayers footing the bill. Materials and Methods: Funding and Acquisition Strategy The bitcoin strategic reserve seeks out novel ways to acquire the asset without placing any further burden on the taxpayers. The U.S. government was previously said to be holding approximately 200,000 bitcoin, worth roughly $18.5 billion, primarily obtained through law enforcement seizures. A scheduled audit of the government’s holdings has to date failed to materialize, and the held bitcoin may have suffered mismanagement by various parties unfamiliar with the technology, but whatever remains of the existing stockpile forms the foundation for an ambitious expansion plan. Use of seized crypto assets by federal agencies Several federal agencies have historically auctioned off any seized cryptocurrency assets, placing the sales’ proceeds into the Department of Justice’s Asset Forfeiture Fund. The establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has changed this approach dramatically, as the executive order mandates that all cryptocurrency seized through criminal or civil forfeiture proceedings must now be transferred to the Treasury Department instead of the general fund where it had normally been flowing to eventually. The U.S. Marshals Service previously managed the auctions of similarly forfeited assets in the past—like artwork, vehicles, etc. This fragmented approach, however, led to several inefficiencies: The captured digital assets were scattered across multiple federal agencies among people who may not have been familiar with the new technology. The reserve’s new centralized management structure addresses these issues, originally by requiring agencies to provide a complete accounting of all of the varying digital assets each had in their possession within 30 days. To date however, the accounting of the nation’s bitcoin is still a grey area. Annual acquisition cap of 200,000 BTC The BITCOIN Act proposed by Senator Lummis calls for a “structured acquisition program” targeting the purchase of 200,000 bitcoin per year over the next five years. This carefully calibrated approach aims to accumulate 1 million bitcoin in total. If successful, these acquisitions would leave the U.S. holding about 5% of all bitcoin that can ever exist. To implement the bitcoin reserve strategy, the Treasury Secretary is directed to \""establish a decentralized network of secure bitcoin storage facilities distributed across the U.S.” These facilities are said to be selected based on comprehensive risk assessments that prioritize geographic diversity, security, and accessibility. This structured approach could allow the government to add to its holdings without also disrupting markets. Reallocation of Federal Reserve surplus and gold certificates To fund the bitcoin strategic reserve, the government is turning to some innovative sources that do not require any additional taxation, including: Reduction of Federal Reserve banks' discretionary surplus funds from $6.83 billion to $2.40 billion Allocation of $6 billion from Federal Reserve annual net earnings for fiscal years 2025-2029 Revaluation of Federal Reserve gold certificates to reflect current market values By far, reevaluation of the gold certificates represents reserve’s the most substantial proposed funding source. Currently, the certificates are valued at their 1974 price of $42.22 per ounce; spot gold trades above $3,000 per ounce today however. Simply updating these certificates to reflect their current fair market value, the reserve could generate nearly $700 billion and not increase the national debt. Senator Lummis has emphasized that this approach is entirely “budget neutral” because it would not use any additional taxpayer funds to acquire bitcoin. Similarly, presidential advisor Bo Hines described the strategy as realizing unrealized gains on existing holdings, effectively just repurposing assets already on government balance sheets. Results and Discussion: Macroeconomic Implications Establishment of the bitcoin strategic reserve creates far-reaching consequences beyond mere asset accumulation, with effects rippling through domestic and international economic landscapes. Monetary policy dynamics and geopolitical relationships are being reshaped. Impact on U.S. dollar stability and inflation control Dollar stability could significantly be affected by the U.S. introduction of bitcoin as a reserve asset. Some proponents argue that a strategic bitcoin reserve would strengthen the dollar's position, but there are also critics suggesting that such bitcoin adoption might signal weakening confidence in traditional monetary systems in general. Indeed, such a reserve could lead to a broad depreciation and underperformance of U.S. financial assets on the global market. Moreover, the impact of bitcoin on inflation remains contested. Bitcoin's deflationary nature theoretically offers protection against excessive inflation, a weakening dollar could create inflationary pressure by raising imported goods costs. However, benchmark estimates suggest these effects may be relatively small. Geopolitical leverage and global digital leadership By establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, the U.S. aims to position itself as the \""crypto capital of the world,” securing geopolitical advantages amid growing competition from China. This move represents a calibrated action that embraces cryptocurrency's future influence without undermining confidence in the dollar. Certainly, such leadership could enhance America's standing in global financial diplomacy, providing additional leverage over foreign adversaries. Furthermore, the initiative sends a clear message that the United States intends to lead in crypto innovation while maintaining the dollar's central role. Potential risks of de-dollarization and market manipulation Dangers of publicizing bitcoin must account for the fact that new payment systems, facilitating cross-border transactions and already without U.S. bank involvement, have been rapidly evolving, potentially undermining dollar hegemony. Despite having clear benefits, the bitcoin strategic reserve also faces substantial risks, among the most substantial, sparking global de-dollarization trends. This will no doubt accelerate the pace at which nations increasingly diversify away from the U.S.-engineered dollar-centric system. There are also legitimate concerns about market manipulation because government purchases or sales of bitcoin may have great psychological impact on bitcoin's already volatile price swings. Senator Warren has brought some questions about possible market manipulation, following price surges right after the reserve announcements. Finally, if the U.S. and a few other major powers accumulate significant amounts of bitcoin, they will effectively control the market, in contradiction of bitcoin's foundational principle: decentralization. Limitations and Criticisms of the Bitcoin Reserve Plan The bitcoin strategic reserve’s ambitious vision will never overcome its criticisms for some, unless “time tells” them otherwise. Dissenting economists and financial experts fuel policymakers, who, new to bitcoin, question both the reserve’s economic viability and its overall governance structure. Volatility and lack of intrinsic value concerns Critics highlight that bitcoin's known price volatility is a—perhaps the—most fundamental obstacle to accepting it as a reserve asset. Historically, bitcoin has experienced violent drops in price, sometimes seeing 50%+ drawbacks in short periods. Despite always recovering and rebounding even higher to date, many still call into question its reliability for a federal reserves fund. This volatility prompted the UK Treasury to reject a bitcoin reserve themselves. \""Bitcoin and other crypto assets have been historically volatile, relative to stable fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and commodities, such as gold,\"" they stated. Beyond volatility, critics also challenge—or perhaps, misunderstand—bitcoin's fundamental value proposition, citing: Lack of intrinsic utility: Unlike the American Strategic Petroleum Reserve, bitcoin lacks any known “utility”---a use or purpose—likely to be found helpful in critical infrastructure, defense, or disaster response scenarios Speculative nature: Some financial experts characterize bitcoin as a “high-beta” speculative asset, and not a true inflation hedge by any means No backing: Unlike dollars or gold certificates, bitcoin is not backed by physical assets or government guarantees, which inspire confidence in stores of value The Swiss National Bank, National Bank of Poland, and Singapore's central bank have all rejected the asset class for their own reserves. Singapore additionally stated that cryptocurrencies \""do not align with long-term investment strategies due to their speculative nature.” ==== Political conflicts of interest and transparency issues Senator Warren has raised continuous concerns about potential conflicts of interest in the strategic reserve's implementation, particularly regarding Trump and his administration officials with cryptocurrency investments and, in trump’s case, memecoins. The strategic reserve’s announcement triggered not-unexpected market volatility—initially causing surges in trading value then sharp drops—leaving some asking questions about the obvious potential for market manipulation inherent. Bloomberg news once characterized the bitcoin reserve as an \""abysmally bad idea\"" creating a \""ready-made vehicle for corruption.\"" Critics argue the reserve effectively functions as a wealth transfer mechanism, which will merely enrich current large bitcoin holders (aka “whales”) and at taxpayer expense. Transparency remains problematic; critics point to the Trump administration's close ties to the cryptocurrency industry. His businesses create undeniable conflicts when establishing regulations for the industry; his administration officials have their own clearly stated financial interests. The inclusion of cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin—a commodity, not a security— in the reserve has been described as wide open to influence by even more special interest influence groups. Conclusion A United States of America strategic bitcoin reserve represents a watershed moment in U.S. and world monetary policy, marking a bold sovereign step into federal management of digital assets. Through careful acquisition of up to 200,000 new bitcoin per year for five years, the U.S. initiative aims to strengthen its own national economic security and address its long-term national debt challenges as well. Despite stated objections, several other economic projections suggest significant potential benefits of the U.S. bitcoin reserve, especially to reduce national debt. VanEck research firm estimates a possible debt reduction of 35% by the year 2049, while new financial mechanisms, like BitBonds, could save another $70 billion annually. Bitcoin's deflationary nature is yet another compelling argument for the bitcoin national strategic reserve. Yet substantial challenges remain. Bitcoin's still-eyebrow-raising price volatility, transparency concerns, plus the political conflicts of interest outlined above demand scrutiny. Critics rightfully question whether cryptocurrency holdings align with traditional reserve asset requirements, particularly given their speculative nature and lack of intrinsic value, Ultimately success depends on the balanced addressing of these valid concerns, while not ignoring a focus on potential—some say probable, others inevitable—long-term economic benefits for the United States of going through with their strategic reserve plan, and fully funding their 1 million bitcoin target—a move which will reshape financial dynamics worldwide and for decades to come.

After being under the radar for a prolonged period, the Tron network seems to be finding its footing again. Recent activities have suggested renewed traction towards the ecosystem, which is evident in user influx and liquidity provision.Tron Network’s Daily Transaction Up 95%CryptoQuant’s Maartunn recently highlighted an impressive uptick in daily transactional activities on the Tron network. The Tuesday commentary shows that the 30-day daily transaction moving average has increased from early 2024 to mid-May 2025.Specifically, the numbers grew from 4.3 million to 8.4 million in the aforementioned timeframe, culminating in a 95% uptick. Notably, there were average transaction spikes on some days, like October 20, 2024’s jump to 10.46 million and May 15, 2025’s upsurge to 9.47 million. Tron 30D Average Daily Transaction However, the 30-day moving average sieved the spikes and presented a clear picture of the network's actual activities. Meanwhile, Maartunn stressed that the glaring traction, possibly steered by factors like growing user interaction and increased stablecoin transfers, indicates stable and increasing user influx to the Tron network.Tether Mints $2B on the Tron NetworkMarket intelligence platform Arkham reported minting activity between the Tether Treasury and the Tron network. The prominent stablecoin issuer created and moved 2 billion USDT from its “Black Hole Address” to the Tether multisignature wallet over two distinct transactions before deploying the tokens on Tron. Tether $2B Minting on Tron As usual, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, confirmed the transaction, noting it is authorized but not issued, specifically for inventory replenishment on the Tron network. However, Tether’s transparency page shows that the minted USDT is already in circulation, as just $126 million is left in that category, signaling rapid demand for stablecoins on the chain.Meanwhile, today’s transaction takes the total authorized minting on the Tron network to $75.7 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s $74.5 billion to become the leading chain in USDT supply. Furthermore, Tron’s $75.6 billion net circulation also trumps Ethereum’s $71.2 billion.Tether’s market cap has now reached $152 billion, making it the third most valuable cryptocurrency, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.Possible Market ImplicationsMeanwhile, TRON has barely reacted to the escalating bullish momentum around its ecosystem. The 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap is up a moderate 12% in the past month and down slightly in the last seven days, despite the broader market's positive trend.However, on a larger scale, Tether’s liquidity injection into the crypto market precedes higher prices. On-chain analytical firm Lookonchain highlighted what this trend means for Bitcoin in a tweet today, providing context for a possible rally to a new all-time high.For perspective, Lookonchain identified a correlation between Tether’s minting and a Bitcoin rally. The tweet noted that Bitcoin reclaimed $100,000 after three months, owing to the leading stablecoin issuer’s $6 billion USDT minting between April 23 and May 7.It observed a similar occurrence on May 15, when Bitcoin broke through $105,000 after Tether minted $2 billion USDT. With the latest minting, the analytical firm suggested that the pioneering cryptocurrency could surpass $109,300 if the upsurge pattern repeats.

2025-05-21T15:46:40.000Z,"As Bitcoin Matures, Each Milestone Demands Exponentially More Capital: Glassnode","As Bitcoin matures, its growth rate slows, with each new valuation milestone requiring exponentially more capital, according to analytics firm Glassnode. Bitcoin extended its bullish streak into the third week of May, rising from around $101,000 on May 15 to over $109,000 by May 21. At press time, Bitcoin had established a new all-time high of $109,500, following an intraday gain of 3.6%. The rally builds on last week’s momentum, during which Bitcoin closed at $106,487, its highest weekly close on record. Slower Capital Inflows with Network MaturityAmid Bitcoin’s continued ascent, analytics firm Glassnode presented data signaling a long-term slowdown in capital inflow relative to earlier growth phases. According to its chart titled “Logarithmic Milestones (Realized Cap),” Bitcoin’s realized capitalization, defined by valuing each coin at the price it last moved on-chain, has increased at a decelerating pace as the asset matures. From early 2011 to February 2013, realized cap jumped from $1 million to $1 billion, reflecting the rapid accumulation of value during Bitcoin’s early adoption phase. However, the following years exhibited slower growth. The realized cap reached $10 billion in November 2013 and did not hit $100 billion until May 2017. Notably, Glassnode’s data shows it has taken nearly six years since then to approach the $1 trillion threshold in 2025. This trend, as highlighted by the flattening curve on the chart, suggests that each subsequent growth milestone requires increasingly more capital inflow.The implications of this data suggest Bitcoin’s expansion is no longer driven by speculative surges but by broader, more gradual adoption. Glassnode attributes this change to the asset’s maturity, stating that each leap in value as Bitcoin evolves becomes more capital-intensive.Bitcoin is Still Setting New Records In spite of the broader slowdown in long-term capital growth, Bitcoin has continued to post new milestones in recent days. The digital asset notched its highest daily closing price in its 15-year trading history on May 20, with market data from Barchart confirming a close at $106,909. This figure surpassed the previous record of $106,487, which had been set just two days earlier.This record-breaking daily close followed another significant achievement, Bitcoin’s highest-ever weekly close. As the market maintained its bullish tone, breaking an all-time high, many industry commentators like Arthur Hayes are expecting BTC to reach a $1 million value someday.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/21/as-bitcoin-matures-each-milestone-demands-exponentially-more-capital-glassnode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=as-bitcoin-matures-each-milestone-demands-exponentially-more-capital-glassnode,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways:Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV.

Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average.

The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems.

In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‘address poisoning’ attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence. That’s what institutions have been waiting for,” Grachev told Cointelegraph during the Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on May 20, adding:“Stablecoins aren’t a crypto experiment anymore. They’re a better form of money. Faster, simpler, and more transparent than fiat.

Monthly remittances typically range from $131 to $648, representing between 6% and 23% of the sender’s average income.“Remittances are lifelines in this region, but they’re broken,” Lapchik told Cointelegraph. “Guatemala alone sees $21 billion in remittances every year, and families are losing 6% to 10% of that to fees and delays. These are people sending $300, $400 a month, and they can’t afford to wait days or pay that much just to get money home,” he said, adding:“Crypto solves this when it’s used the right way. It lets us move money instantly and at a fraction of the cost, integrated into the bank apps people already use.” Latin America is the second-fastest growing region in terms of crypto adoption, though Guatemala lags behind regional leaders Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, according to a 2024 Chainalysis study.The study cited stablecoins as a primary adoption driver in the region. Crypto adoption in Latin America by total value received.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders.

The platform will be powered by Maia, an AI core engine developed by My Aion, and aims to optimize and manage systems across mobility, energy, education, healthcare and digital services. My Aion CEO Daniele Marinelli said the AI will know the user well enough to “recommend the perfect place for your anniversary dinner and book it for you without you lifting a finger.”The project will debut in Abu Dhabi before expanding internationally. It is expected to launch in 18 months. Multibillion-dollar AI project to create jobs for UAE nationalsThe project is structured under a $2.5 billion Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, a public-private partnership model for large-scale infrastructure and technology projects. Under the model, private sector entities construct the infrastructure, run and manage the system for a certain period. The companies usually recoup their investments and earn profits during the operational phase. At the end of the period set by the parties involved, ownership and control of the systems developed through the BOT model are transferred to the government or a public sector entity. Bold Technologies CEO Thani Al Thani Al Falasi said the initiative will support UAE job creation. “This initiative will support job creation for UAE nationals, foster local innovation and contribute meaningfully to the national AI ecosystem,” he said. My Aion’s Marinelli said that relocating to Abu Dhabi provides their global operations with a new chapter. “The UAE offers the infrastructure and institutional support needed to scale responsibly and strategically,” Marinelli said.Cointelegraph has reached out to Bold Technologies and My Aion for more information. Related: Decentralized OORT AI data hits top ranks on Google KaggleCrypto proponents say AI could benefit from digital assetsOn May 20, Catena Labs, a project led by Circle co-founder Sean Neville, announced that it will create an AI-native financial institution.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case. In August 2024, NFT trading platform OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC, alleging that NFTs traded on the marketplace could qualify as unregistered securities. On Feb. 22, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the SEC has officially closed its investigation into the platform. The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries. The lawyers urged the SEC to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws.”Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-royalties-not-securities-sec-peirce?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T08:27:53.000Z,"South Korea tightens crypto rules ahead of institutional market entry","South Korea is tightening rules around digital asset transactions as it prepares to allow institutional players into its crypto market, introducing new guidelines for nonprofit crypto sales and stricter listing standards for exchanges.On May 20, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea said during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting that it had finalized sweeping new measures.Set to take effect in June, the updated rules allow both nonprofit organizations and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies, but under new compliance standards.Nonprofit entities must have at least five years of audited financial history to be permitted to receive and sell virtual asset donations. They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations. Source: FSCRelated: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFsExchange sales to be restrictedCrypto exchanges will be allowed to liquidate user fees paid in crypto, but only to cover operational costs. Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors.Cointelegraph contacted South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cardsSouth Korean candidates push pro-crypto agendaSouth Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, aiming to curb capital flight and bolster the country’s financial autonomy.Speaking at a recent policy forum, Lee said a won-based stablecoin could help retain domestic wealth and reduce dependence on foreign-backed digital currencies such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC).The initiative is part of Lee’s broader push for digital asset reforms, which also includes legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party, has also expressed support for introducing spot crypto ETFs, signaling bipartisan momentum on the issue.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-tightens-kyc-rules-ahead-of-institutional-crypto-entry?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC. There is little doubt that institutional buying remains the primary catalyst for Bitcoin to break above the $108,000 level. Such a move would trigger the liquidation of heavily leveraged bearish positions, likely accelerating the push to a new all-time high. However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation.

Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some.
