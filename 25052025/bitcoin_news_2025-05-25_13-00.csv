2025-05-25T10:43:27.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC at $107,911 After Big Week — Will Lower Volume Drive Volatility to $115K?","Bitcoin is holding at $107,911 down 1.10% in the last 24 hours with $46.17B in trading volume. As we head into the Memorial Day weekend all eyes are on whether reduced liquidity will lead to big moves to $115,000. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Renewed Institutional Confidence Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw significant inflows between May 17 and May 23, totaling $2.75 billion, a 4.5× increase from the previous week, according to Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out, continuing its eight-day streak of inflows. Supporting this, Coinglass data reveals heightened spot exchange activity. On May 23, the BTC spot exchange net inflow heatmap shows Binance leading with $19.87 million in net inflows over a 1-hour window, while Bybit, OKX, Kraken, and Bitstamp saw smaller inflows. Bitcoin Spot Data Analysis – Source: Coinglass Spot exchange volume heatmaps confirm Binance’s dominance with $92.84 million, followed by Bybit’s $42.71 million. Bitcoin Spot Data Analysis – Source: Coinglass Key highlights: Spot ETF inflows : $2.75B between May 17–23; $5.39B total for May Spot exchange inflows : Binance $19.87M net inflow, Bitstamp $1.91M Exchange volume : Binance $92.84M, Bybit $42.71M, OKX $22.34M This data aligns with Bitcoin’s recent rally to $111,970 on May 22 and suggests renewed institutional and exchange-driven interest. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index cooled from 78 (“Extreme Greed”) to 66 (“Greed”), reflecting a slight pullback in sentiment. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Key Levels for the Weekend On the 2 hour chart Bitcoin is testing supports as it’s below the 50 period EMA at $108,315. Price is pressing against the ascending trendline at $107,000 and the Fibonacci retracement levels from the $102,190 low to the $111,958 high have $107,074 as a key pivot. Supports : $107,074, $105,905, $104,289 Resistance : $108,315, $109,637 Indicators : Bearish MACD crossover, indecision candles, trendline pressure If BTC goes below $107,000 expect drops to $105,905 or $104,289. But if it goes above $108,315 it could regain bullish momentum and target $109,637 and above. Hence, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish under $107,.000 and vice versa. Will Thin Liquidity Cause a Weekend Spike? With the long weekend ahead reduced liquidity will amplify price movements. If ETF inflows continue and technicals recover BTC might go to $115,000. But if indecision and low volume persists BTC could move big in either direction. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.33M Cap as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With BTC/USD falling below $108,000, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.33 million has been raised out of a $7.33 million cap. The presale is closing in on its limit, next presale price jump closes in fast. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher Bitcoin’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with Bitcoin’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of Bitcoin-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,329,314.26 / $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

2025-05-25T10:40:35.000Z,"Bitcoin trader closes $1.2 billion position following $13 million loss","James Wynn, a Hyperliquid whale who shot into the limelight for profitable trades, has recorded $13.39 million in losses in his long position with Bitcoin. The trader had been bullish on Bitcoin, predicting it would reach as high as $118,000. According to on-chain analyst EmberCN, Wynn liquidated his $11,588 BTC ($1.2 billion) long position on Bitcoin after the flagship asset dropped to $107,000. His actual liquidation price is $105,180, but he chose to close all positions, complete the process within 47 minutes, and take over $13 million in losses. Interestingly, the decision to liquidate comes less than 24 hours after he posted on X that Bitcoin would reach $110,500 today and should climb up to $121,000 by next week. While many people praised his bullish post then, his decision to close all his positions was a surprise. However, Wynn justified closing the positions, noting that technical analysis showing a golden cross spooked him and made him close his positions. While the golden cross is considered a bullish signal, it is usually preceded by a dip in price. Crypto analyst Kyle Chasse had predicted that Bitcoin could drop between 10% and 15% before seeing another liftoff that could send it to a new high. Chasse added that altcoins could even fall further. Despite closing his biggest Bitcoin at a loss, the trader reportedly made $8.45 million in combined profits on all his Bitcoin positions over the last few days, benefiting from BTC’s recent rally. Market volatility leaves Hyperliquid whales with mixed result Meanwhile, this is not the first time Wynn would take a loss on a trade, even though his cumulative PNL remains positive. According to Lookonchain, the trader took a $5.3 million loss after closing his ETH and SUI long positions on May 24. However, he also made $25.19 million in total profits on his PEPE memecoin longs, which were held for more than 2 months. During that period, PEPE gained a 62% increase in value. Another popular whale, Machi Big Brother, made $2.1 million in profits on Hyperliquid after opening long positions on ETH and HYPE tokens with $6.04 million. He made over $669,000 on the trade and used all his funds to buy almost 219,000 HYPE tokens, which he staked. With all the massive trading on Hyperliquid, which has seen the decentralized exchange dominate trading volume for decentralized perps, the HYPE token has been rising in value. In fact, it is up more than 5% in the last 24 hours and trades around $35 after gaining more than 100% in the last two months. Interestingly, HYPE’s performance, which has seen it gain 30% in the past week, has forced some traders who short the token to capitulate. One trader has lost $23.5 million on shorting HYPE on Hyperliquid and had to close all their short positions after more than four weeks. Over $180 million liquidated in 24 hours as crypto futures dominate trading Meanwhile, Wynn’s decision to close his long positions is unsurprising, given that the recent price correction has liquidated several long positions. According to CoinGlass data, $182.82 million of positions have been liquidated, and $138.57 million are long positions. ETH bulls are the most affected, with $43.46 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin with $20.82 million. SOL bulls also lost $7.20 million in liquidation after the recent drop in price. With longs getting liquidated, it is not surprising that short positions over the last 24 hours have increased and now account for almost 52% of open positions. Meanwhile, the market volatility is attracting more speculative trading, with the Spot to Futures ratio on Binance now at 4.9, the highest in 18 months. The 4.9 ratio means the futures volume is 4.9 times bigger than the spot volume. Futures to Spot Volume Ratio on Binance hits 18-month high (Source: CryptoQuant ) Despite the volatility, experts believe that Bitcoin would still go higher. Crypto analyst Crypto Dan said a few days ago that the market had not reached overheated territory as metrics such as short-term capital inflows and funding rates remain low compared to previous peaks. Thus, BTC might still set a new high in this cycle. The recent drop appears only to be a price correction in reaction to the announcement of a potential 50% tariff against the European Union and a 25% tariff on Apple iPhones if it continues to manufacture outside the US.

2025-05-25T10:29:09.000Z,"Elon Musk’s Company Tesla (TSLA) Owns 11,900 BTC Worth $1.2 Billion","Tesla (TSLA), an Electric Vehicle company owned by Elon Musk, has 11,900 BTC worth around $1.2 billion. Arkham Intelligence revealed the latest estimates after analysing blockchain data. Tesla first announced its strategy to buy Bitcoin in Q1 2021. In a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, on February 8, 2021, Tesla reported the purchase of 43,200 BTC worth around $1.5 billion. At the time, Tesla introduced various measures to incorporate Bitcoin into the company, such as an option to pay for EV cars with BTC. However, Tesla abandoned this option when there were concerns regarding Bitcoin’s use of proof-of-work methods that negatively impact the environment. In May 2021, the option to buy Tesla cars with Bitcoin was removed. Tesla employs Coinbase Prime Custody to handle its large Bitcoin treasury. The company has been interested in cryptocurrencies for some time, but has had to reconsider some use cases due to the ongoing concern regarding Bitcoin’s use of fossil fuels. Tesla aims to promote EV cars to support sustainable practices. Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm relies on large amounts of electricity, which still depend on fossil fuels and coal production. There is speculation that Musk will integrate tokens such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin into his businesses. Musk bought $1.5 billion Bitcoin in 2021, but had to sell many of the tokens to pay for expenses. Musk may be reconsidering his sales due to the increasing wealth that crypto adds to his balance sheet. On April 22, Tesla revealed that it owned 11,509 BTC, worth around $1.05 billion on its balance sheet. However, due to the current rise in price and an all-time high (ATH) of $111,000 for Bitcoin, Tesla’s holdings have gone up to around $1.2 billion. Tesla may have missed many opportunities due to its back-and-forth policy regarding digital assets. For example, in March 2021, Tesla added the option to buy electric cars with Bitcoin. However, the EV maker flip-flopped in May 2021 because of concerns that Bitcoin was reversing the positive aspects of Tesla due to its reliance on fossil fuels. Further, during Q1 2021, Tesla sold 10% of its Bitcoin holdings, making a $272 million profit. Then Tesla sold 75% of its remaining Bitcoin in Q2 2022, leaving only 9,720 BTC in its treasury. Elon Musk said that he sold Bitcoin because the company needed the money. However, if Musk held onto the 43k BTC, the company would have nearly $5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Other companies also hold Bitcoin treasuries, which can be compared to Tesla’s approach. Strategy holds 576,230 BTC and made its latest purchase of 7,390 BTC on May 19 for around $764 million. With a Bitcoin price of $111,000, Strategy would own around $63 billion. Metaplanet, a Tokyo-listed company, also creates a large Bitcoin treasury. Metaplanet recently added 1,004 BTC to its treasury, falling short of 2,000 BTC from its target of 10,000 BTC. Governments are also interested in Bitcoin treasuries. President Trump has approved a Bitcoin treasury that uses seized assets from federal investigations. Meanwhile, at the state level, New Hampshire and Texas have approved local treasuries, further boosting the popularity of cryptocurrencies. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changed the rules regarding digital asset holdings. Many investors complained because the old rules required a public company to use cost accounting methods to list crypto assets. The problem with cost accounting methods is that the crypto assets are listed at their bought price and are changed if the asset drops in value, which may severely undervalue the asset. The new changes allow companies to report the fair value of their digital assets. For example, when Tesla bought Bitcoin at $30k, the company reported the value of each Bitcoin at $30k. When the price fell to $15k, Tesla reported the value of each Bitcoin as $15k. However, when Bitcoin bounced back up in value, Tesla continued to report that it had a value of $15k. In fact, from 2022 to 2024, Tesla reported the same amount of $184 million in Bitcoin holdings, despite a price change.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/elon-musks-company-tesla-tsla-owns-11900-btc-worth-1-2-billion/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk",cryptocompare
2025-05-25T10:20:04.000Z,"Pakistan to allocate 2000-MW electricity for Bitcoin mining","Pakistan’s government has moved to allocate 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national plan to support Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. According to Pakistan’s Finance Minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, this is the country’s first significant step towards becoming a digital economy. He said, “This allocation of power is not just about crypto or AI—it’s about shaping a digital future for the country.” The minister added that excess electricity could now be used as a “source of national income.” A Finance Division statement mentioned that the initiative, backed by PCC (Pakistan Crypto Council), a government-backed body, is following a broad strategy to create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions in government income. PCC CEO, Bilal bin Saqib said, “This energy-backed digital transformation not only unlocks high-value investment but enables the government to generate foreign exchange in USD through bitcoin mining.” The statement further added that Pakistan is both economically and geographically positioned to become a “global hub for data centers” because it is a digital bridge between the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Pakistan government to introduce tax incentives Sources close to the Ministry mentioned that the government may soon introduce tax exemptions to boost the development of blockchain infrastructure and AI. These incentives may include an easing of income tax and import tariffs for companies investing in data centers. The government also revealed its plans to develop renewable energy-powered data centers in the next phase. Officials have already confirmed that the new Africa-2 Submarine Sable Project will boost the country’s internet connectivity. This undersea cable links 46 landing stations with 33 countries across Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. It is expected to boost the country’s bandwidth, add backup routes, and lower latency, all of which are essential for data-intensive blockchain and AI operations. Earlier this week, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir met with Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib to explore the country’s move into digital finance. During the meeting, Saqib highlighted the key part young Pakistanis will play in this shift. He said, “The Pakistan Crypto Council exists because our youth demand a seat at the global tech table. We are building for a generation that sees digital finance, decentralization, and AI as opportunities to lead, innovate, and uplift the nation.” Saqib then briefed the army chief on the council’s recent activities. He noted a visit by a World Liberty Financial delegation and by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. He also spoke about ongoing talks to shape regulations and about partnerships meant to build digital skills and boost the country’s standing on the world stage. Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) has also signed a Letter of Intent with the Pakistan Crypto Council. The goal is to speed up blockchain projects, stablecoin use, and wider DeFi adoption in Pakistan.

2025-05-25T10:03:19.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Displays Signs of Weakness Following New All-Time High","Bitcoin surpassed its all-time high of $109K earlier this week, reaching a new high of $112K. Despite this, the price exhibits slight bullish momentum, suggesting a potential consolidation at this level for the short term. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Bitcoin has officially broken above its previous all-time high of $109K, establishing a new peak around the $112K region. This breakout underscores strong buyer interest and highlights the bullish sentiment that continues to fuel this cycle. However, the recent price action suggests that bullish momentum is softening, with BTC beginning a minor pullback toward the broken $109K level. This area now acts as a crucial support zone. If renewed demand materializes at this level, Bitcoin could resume its upward trajectory toward the $115K mark and potentially higher. Conversely, if selling pressure intensifies and the $109K level fails to hold, a deeper correction may unfold. In this scenario, a retest of the psychological $100K support becomes increasingly probable, potentially classifying the breakout as a bull trap, shaking investor confidence, and introducing volatility in the short term. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, BTC maintains a bullish market structure, with a clear sequence of higher highs and higher lows. The price has consistently respected an ascending trendline, which remains a key dynamic support. Following the breakout, Bitcoin is currently retracing toward this trendline as well as the broken $109K swing high. This confluence zone will play a pivotal role in determining the next move. Should it hold, a renewed rally toward the $115K resistance zone becomes highly likely. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold this level and breaks below the trendline, it would signal short-term weakness, opening the door for a correction toward the $100K range. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets While BTC has reached a new all-time high at $112K, a wave of profit-taking is naturally expected, particularly from short-term traders securing gains. However, a deeper look into on-chain metrics reveals a contrasting narrative among long-term holders, investors who have held BTC for over 150 days. The LTH-SOPR has remained relatively low during this rally, especially when compared to the levels seen during Bitcoin’s surge to $73K in late-2024. Despite the price now being significantly higher, long-term holders are not showing signs of major profit realization. This indicates ongoing accumulation behavior, reflecting confidence in higher future valuations. This divergence in behavior highlights that the current consolidation phase is likely driven by short-term holders and retail participants, rather than broader market distribution. If long-term holders continue to display conviction, Bitcoin is well-positioned to resume its uptrend following this short-term pause, with the potential to set new ATHs in the mid-term.

2025-05-25T10:00:45.000Z,"VanEck Exec Slams SEC For Delay On Bitcoin ETF Options – Details","Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, has criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a delayed response on a proposal to list options trading on the firm’s Bitcoin Spot ETF. Notably, the Commission has continued to issue delayed responses to all recent digital asset-related ETF proposals/amendments despite a crypto-friendly policy of the Donald Trump Administration. SEC Delay Is Frustrating, Offers No Feedback, VanEck’s Sigel Says On April 3, 2025, the Chicago Board of Exchange (Cboe) filed a proposed rule change to list options trading on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL). For context, options trading grants investors the right to buy and sell an asset at a specific price before a certain date. Following the resounding success of the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs, options trading became a potential mode of market expansion, with several asset managers submitting applications to offer options to their respective ETFs. Notably, the SEC has granted approval for this request for multiple Bitcoin ETFs, including the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), among others. However, following the initial 45-day review, the Commission has delayed a response on Cboe’s proposal to list trading options on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL). In an X post on May 23, Matthew Sigel strongly criticized this decision, which he described as “frustrating” and offered no transparency to investors. While tagging Hester Pierce, the Head of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, Sigel complained that the Commission had issued a delayed response while offering no comments or feedback along with this decision. The VanEck Exec explained the asset manager’s objection to this development while responding to a user comment. He said. This was the first decision date, so it has not been rejected, just delayed, even though the SEC’s initial comments were addressed. It’s the lack of any feedback that is particularly irksome… It is highly worth noting that delayed responses by the SEC have been quite a common response for digital assets ETF-related proposals. The Commission can choose to wait till the final decision deadline, i.e., 240 days after the application, as seen with the Bitcoin Spot ETFs in 2024. However, Sigel’s concerns stem from an absence of an explanation on this delayed ruling, especially considering that options trading has been approved for certain other Bitcoin Spot ETFs.

Yet, while these established assets anchor portfolios, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly registering the heaviest surge in community activity and presale demand—making it the most-watched early-stage contender for 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Breakout Presale, 50% Bonus, and Unmatched Community Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining early-stage momentum, with Stage 8 live and over $8 million raised as buy activity accelerates daily. The project’s scarcity-driven tokenomics—a capped 100 billion supply, HashEx audit, and viral narrative—are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy, valued at over $133,000, marks the largest early-stage purchase of 2025 and underscores growing institutional confidence. Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those seeking transformative gains. With Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the go-to allocation for those seeking the next crypto supercycle winner before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth and Institutional Adoption Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a possible breakout above $2,700. Institutional adoption and ongoing upgrades continue to support ETH’s long-term outlook, but its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Positive Trend and Ecosystem Expansion Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183. The network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding DeFi ecosystem are attracting both users and developers. While Solana’s growth is robust, its upside is steadier than the presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Steady Inflows Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with forecasts suggesting a range of $111,000–$115,000 for late May and potential highs of $140,000 if bullish momentum continues. While BTC remains the market’s anchor, its upside is now more measured—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the clear destination for investors targeting higher-growth opportunities. Stellar Lumens (XLM): Quiet Strength, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Stellar is projected to trade between $0.65 and $0.80 in 2025, with technicals and institutional interest supporting long-term gains. While XLM’s fundamentals are strong, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Ethereum and Solana’s steady advances are noteworthy, but the heaviest community surge and most dramatic growth potential are now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 40x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

Ethereum ETFs : $58.63M invested, 22,000 ETH added. ETF Activity (May 23): Approximately 1,900 BTC and 22,000 ETH were purchased. #Bitcoin ETFs recorded $211.74M in net inflows. #Ethereum ETFs saw $58.63M in net inflows. — Pushpendra Singh Digital (@PushpendraTech) May 24, 2025 These flows show ETH is back in favor. The renewed interest is likely due to recent regulatory clarity, improving macro and network upgrades. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Caution on Key Levels On the 2-hour chart, ETH has broken the trendline and is stuck below the 50-period EMA at $2,555 which is now resistance. Given the bearish breakout of an upward trendline at around $2,500 area, the Ethereum price prediction remains bearish. Candlestick patterns at $2,523 are showing hesitation and the widening MACD histogram is bearish momentum. Key levels to watch: Support : $2,378, $2,272, $2,172. Resistance : $2,555, $2,626. Indicators : Bearish MACD, EMA acting as resistance, trendline break is bearish. For traders, patience is key. A confirmed break below $2,378 could mean more downside until $2,300. Above $2,555 and we could see a rally back to $2,800. Will Memorial Day Liquidity Cause a Ethereum Price Squeeze? With volume likely to be thin over the long weekend, ETH could see bigger moves. If ETF flows continue and sentiment stays positive, we could see a break above resistance. But if the market is hesitant, we may see ETH test lower support early next week. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.33M Cap as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With ETH/USD falling below $2,500, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.33 million has been raised out of a $7.33 million cap. The presale is closing in on its limit, next presale price jump closes in fast. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher Bitcoin’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with Bitcoin’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of Bitcoin-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,329,314.26 / $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel. In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country. The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility.

Officials confirmed that multiple foreign delegations have visited Pakistan in recent months to explore potential partnerships. To further incentivize investment, the Ministry of Finance announced a package of tax incentives for AI centers and duty exemptions for Bitcoin miners. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of Pakistan’s Crypto Council, reportedly welcomed the development, calling it a “turning point” for the country’s digital economy. Saqib claimed that with clear regulations and a transparent framework, Pakistan could emerge as a significant player in the global crypto and AI sectors. Saqib first proposed using the country’s runoff energy to fuel Bitcoin mining at the Crypto Council’s inaugural meeting on March 21. The meeting included lawmakers, the Bank of Pakistan’s governor, the chairman of Pakistan’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SECP), and the federal information technology secretary.

2025-05-25T09:45:23.000Z,"Hackers steal company’s data, demand ransom in Bitcoin","The central cyber police in Mumbai have arrested unidentified individuals for hacking into an advertising company’s server in Kurla. According to the authorities, the hackers stole tons of company data and demanded a ransom of about Rs. 4.5 lakh (approximately $5,283) in Bitcoins. According to the police, the hackers, upon gaining access and stealing the data, threatened to delete the important ones if the company refused to comply with their ransom demands. This move is defined as ransomware, where hackers or malicious entities gain access to a system or important information and threaten to delete it if the victims do not comply with payments. Over the years, there has been a series of ransomware cases, involving even entities with the most sophisticated security. Hackers demand Bitcoin to return the company’s sensitive data According to the authorities, the issue came to light on May 3, after the company’s staff started encountering issues while logging into its servers. The police mentioned that after gaining access to the servers using the “forgot password” option, they realized that a lot of data was missing. The company proceeded to hire third-party IT contractors to look into the issue, and it was then that they found a note from the hackers detailing their activities. According to the police, the hackers left a note in the form of a text file for the company on their server, which stated that they were able to carry out the activity because the company lacked better security measures. They also added that the company would have to pay a big ransom in order to protect their files and not have them damaged beyond repairs. The text file also mentioned that the hackers would completely damage the stolen data should the company make any attempt to either recover them or delete files on its server. The hackers added that if the company refused to comply with their demands and pay the ransom soon, they would either delete the stolen data or leak it online. Finally, they said it was a one-time deal, adding that they could even go ahead to give the company tips on how to strengthen its security after the ransom is paid. Police to charge suspects as global crypto-related crimes rise According to the police, when the advertising agency enlisted the services of a cyber security expert to look into the issue, they submitted a report saying that the hackers had used the Brute Force Attack method to gain access into their server. The cyber security firm mentioned that the hacker used trial and error methods until they were in the company’s servers. The police mentioned that they received a complaint from 33-year-old Pranay Ramaiyaa, who is a resident of Thane and an employee of the advertising agency. The police have also proceeded to register a case against the unknown suspects, charging them under sections 43 (penalty and compensation for damage to the computer, computer system, etc.), 65 (tampering with computer source documents), and 66 (computer-related offenses) of the Information Technology Act and under sections 308 (extortion) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Meanwhile, this is not the first case of ransom demands related to digital assets over the last few months, with criminal elements now upping their activities, targeting influential entities in the sector. For instance, some months ago, the father of a crypto millionaire was kidnapped, with his son urged to pay ransom in digital assets or else they would kill him. The criminals even went ahead to mutilate the man, using it as a pressure tactic to force his son to pay the ransom. Another incident that happened recently was that of crypto investor John Woeltz, who kidnapped and tied up a tourist for weeks, forcing him to give up the passwords to his account. The tourist, who coincidentally was a long-time business partner of the suspect, said the assailant inflicted many wounds on him and took pictures of it to either blackmail him into giving up his assets or scare his family into paying a ransom.

With Chainlink steady and XRP whales accumulating, institutional and retail investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Bitcoin as the top contenders to watch for Q3 2025’s breakout. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Moves, 50% Bonus, and Early-Stage Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming 2025’s most-watched presale, with over $8 million raised and a record-setting 72.95 ETH whale buy marking the largest early-stage purchase of the year. The project’s capped supply, HashEx audit, and scarcity-driven tokenomics are driving unprecedented demand. Early buyers can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those seeking exponential upside. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. As Stage 8 nears completion, smart money is positioning ahead of listings, recognizing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity before price discovery goes public. Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support Bitcoin is trading in the $110,000–$115,000 range, with technicals showing strong bullish momentum and support at $110K. The breakout above April’s highs has ended a long consolidation, and BTC is now in price discovery mode. Institutional inflows remain robust, and as long as BTC holds above $110K, analysts expect a push toward $112K–$115K in the coming sessions. This steady foundation is prompting investors to rotate some capital into higher-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Sentiment XRP is consolidating near $2.42, with recent whale transactions totaling over $300 million signaling confidence in the token’s future. The number of large XRP wallets has surged, reflecting growing influence from major investors. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if momentum persists. As XRP holders seek sharper upside, many are reallocating to early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK): Steady, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana is trading between $158 and $175, consolidating after a recent high near $183, with technicals suggesting a potential breakout if resistance is cleared. Chainlink remains steady, with price forecasts between $10.32 and $16.47 for 2025. However, both are being outpaced in sentiment and capital flows by the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion With Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana providing stability, the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Stage 8 nears completion and the 50% PATRIOT50X bonus remains, this may be the last low-entry window before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next breakout, MAGA is the name to watch for Q3 2025.

2025-05-25T09:26:11.000Z,"Is Strategy (MSTR) facing a 25% drop?","Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is on a wild ride as it runs up by 119% over the past year. Mostly seen as the Bitcoin proxy stock now boasts a staggering $101 billion market cap. However, its recent bet on Bitcoin might have opened a crack beneath the surface. 10X Research warns that Strategy’s days of high-flying volume may be over. Retail traders who were chasing the rally could soon shift toward even riskier, more volatile names like Metaplanet. This comes in when BTC went on to hit a fresh all-time high (ATH) of over $111,900 on May 22 before tracing back to the $107k zone. Strategy risks steep pullback Options traders say the days of 200–300% implied volatility are gone. Strategy’s at-the-money options now sit at 76%, which is still high, while the realized volatility is collapsing. For MSTR, declining volume also means less opportunity to source cheap volatility and sell it at a premium. The report highlighted that the market could enter a phase where Strategy can acquire significantly less Bitcoin than it has over the past six months. 10x Research stated that it would “consider shorting MicroStrategy at $400, setting a stop loss at $430, and risking $30 to potentially gain $100 if the stock retreats to $300.” It added that the momentum is fading as bearish divergences are flashing, and all three major reversal indicators have flipped negative. The 21-day moving average is sitting at $390, and below that level, long positions start looking shaky. A pullback could happen simply due to a compression in net asset value or, more broadly, if Bitcoin begins to consolidate. It is inevitable unless Strategy continues to drive it higher. If MicroStrategy fails to hold the $400 level, the door to $300 swings is wide open. And as BTC volatility cools, the upside chase might move elsewhere, it added. MSTR’s Bitcoin bet grows As of May 2025, Strategy holds 568,840 Bitcoin (approx. worth $60 billion), after adding a massive 80,715 BTC just in Q1. It is suggested that the pace of Bitcoin accumulation may slow as the past six months saw unprecedented BTC purchases. Maintaining that momentum will be tough without further capital or massive Bitcoin price surges. Strategy stock price has dropped by 7.5% in the last trading session to stand at $369.51. After-hours trading data shows that it might drop by another 3% to touch the $366 zone. However, it is still up by 23% year to date (YTD). Bitcoin has seen a week full of fluctuations. On Monday, BTC was trading around $103K and went on to knock $106K in a few hours and saw a dump to straight $102K area. The original crypto then hovered above the $111K, trying to breach into $112K, but failed. Bitcoin is trading at an average of $107,380 at press time with a trading volume of $45 billion.

In a new interview with Jimmy Conor, Alden says she’s expecting more or less “stagnant” markets in the near future. However, Alden says there will be “pockets of opportunity” – one of which is US financials, which she says she’s bullish on. “I think that’s kind of the phase we’re entering, so that’s why I expect a generally more stagnant market with pockets of opportunity. I’m public that I’m actually bullish on US financials at the current time. Ironically, as the US enters a slow-motion fiscal crisis, one of the winning sides is the private sector financials because everybody is fighting the last battle of what banks are going to be in trouble, or are we going to have a big credit event… I think that the biggest one is on the sovereign level, and that tends to be pretty decent for the private entities in the ecosystem… Basically, this gets taken out in terms of fiscal dominance, running things hot for a long period of time, taking it out on the currency rather than through major private sector deleveraging. So I think right now US banks on average are pretty cheap and they’re pretty well capitalized, so outside of certain rare pockets, I’m pretty bullish on US financials and US banks in particular. No one’s really interested in buying them right now, but I find them interesting. It’s not the only asset I’d own, but I’m a lot less bearish on them than the market seems to think.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Frenzy, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the early-stage pack, with every presale stage selling out faster than the last and over $8 million already raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand. Key reasons traders are watching MAGA closely: Community-driven narrative that cuts through market noise and builds lasting engagement. Early-stage positioning with robust tokenomics and a strict supply cap. Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target, with analyst forecasts pointing to 18,500% upside if momentum holds.

Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Ecosystem Growth Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183. The network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding DeFi ecosystem are attracting both users and developers.

Ethereum (ETH): Steady Climb and Institutional Interest Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a possible breakout toward $2,800–$2,900 if bullish sentiment holds. Analysts expect that sustained momentum above $2,650 could open the door to $2,900 and beyond, with some forecasts even targeting $4,500 by year-end if institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth persist. While ETH remains a core holding, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and June Outlook Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with forecasts suggesting a range of $113,000–$136,700 for June if bullish momentum continues. BTC’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, but its upside is now more measured—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the clear destination for investors targeting higher multiples. XRP and TRON: Steady Progress, MAGA Steals the Spotlight XRP is trading near $2.50, showing a solid uptrend supported by bullish technicals and whale accumulation. TRON is consolidating around $0.27, with forecasts suggesting a climb to $0.32 in early June. While both assets remain strong, their growth is more gradual compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Solana and Ethereum are gaining traction, but the heaviest community surge and most dramatic growth potential are now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 35x–50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for June and beyond.

2025-05-25T08:48:39.000Z,"XRP Price Prediction: XRP Holds $2.31 Before Memorial Day Volume Decline — Will Reduced Institutional Activity Spark Rally to $2.75?","XRP is holding at $2.31 as Memorial Day (Monday, May 26) approaches, down 1.55% in the last 24 hours and $1.49 billion in trading volume. While this price stagnation is due to broader market uncertainty, the potential for a post-holiday bounce is growing especially with Ripple’s recent foray into real estate tokenization in the UAE. UAE’s Real Estate Tokenization Boosts XRPL; XRP Supported Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL) has been chosen by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) as the blockchain for its real estate tokenization project. According to DLD’s senior executive Mahmoud AlBurai, over 3,000 investors have registered interest in the pilot, strong demand for tokenized property ownership. Currently, participation is limited to Emirates cardholders who are official UAE residents. Key points: Partnerships with Prypco Mint and Ctrl Alt to tokenize ownership deeds for government properties. Ripple’s $10M investment in tokenized US Treasury bills on XRPL via OpenEden. $5M stake in a tokenized money market fund by UK-based Abrdn last year. This real-world asset (RWA) initiative is the first of its kind in the MENA region and strengthens XRPL’s case for institutional adoption. Ripple’s payments service is already onboarding institutions, licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). XRP/USD Technical Analysis: Descending Triangle in Focus XRP price prediction seems bearish for now as on the 2-hour chart, Ripple is in a descending triangle, a pattern that often precedes breakouts. It’s hovering around horizontal support at $2.2856, with recent candlesticks (spinning tops and doji) indicating market indecision. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview 50-period EMA ($2.3600) and horizontal resistance at $2.3557 cap the upside. MACD histogram is flattening, bearish momentum is slowing. Targets : Break above $2.3600 could be $2.4098 and $2.4756. Failure to hold $2.2856 could be $2.2440 or $2.1970. New traders should wait for a confirmed breakout above trendline resistance and EMA to be reclaimed before going long, with stops below $2.2440. XRP Outlook: Will Lower Volume Spark a Rally? With volume thinning out during holidays like Memorial Day , institutional activity tends to slow down—sometimes creating a perfect storm for a squeeze. If XRP holds $2.31, a light market could be a quick bounce to $2.75. But with the SEC’s XRP stance still unclear and broader market uncertainty, be prepared for volatility. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.33M Cap as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With XRP/USD steady at $2.31, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.33 million has been raised out of a $7.33 million cap. The presale is closing in on its limit, next presale price jump closes in fast. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher Bitcoin’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with Bitcoin’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of Bitcoin-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,329,314.26 / $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

2025-05-25T08:36:00.000Z,"Cardano Holders Eye the Next Big Thing as ADA Lags Behind a Surging PayFi Rival","Is it time to hold a farewell party for Cardano? While Cardano is certainly a great project, it has just not found its market. After several false starts, the Cardano price is frustratingly low and even the extreme 25-year Cardano price predictions show the token price flat. Considering Bitcoin has just hit an all-time high and the markets are white hot, seeing Cardano slip down the ranks to ninth place is quite disheartening. Fortunately, the new PayFi token Remittix is dominating the presale market and Cardano’s unrealized gains can be made up with Remittix. Source: Coingecko Cardano ( ADA ): Technical perfection means nothing if you can’t sell it From the outset, Cardano made it its mission to create a technically perfect blockchain. According to many, it has succeeded. The Cardano chain ticks all the boxes: it is secure, robust, scalable and can handle just about anything one hands it. This perfection comes at a cost, though. The Cardano blockchain is too slow for retail applications and expensive to operate. It’s a superyacht in a world of speedboats. Not everyone needs Cardano’s robust infrastructure; for most applications, Cardano is overkill. Cardano is perfect for governmental and institutional use , but until the world goes full blockchain, Cardano will not get its moment in the sun. Coincodex shows that Cardano’s price will be steady even over the next 25 years and adjusted for inflation, shows Cardano may even lose money. Source: Coincodex Maybe the time has come to thank Cardano for its service, but let the newer, faster chains take it from here. As for Cardino investors? They are finding solace in the potential of Remittix. Remittix (RMX): New PayFi token shows huge promise PayFi is a brand-new concept pioneered by Remittix . It brings the capacity to use blockchain tech and cryptocurrency to make direct-to-fiat bank account payments to almost any account in the world. If that does not sound like a big deal, here’s the lowdown: Global payments are incredibly slow and prone to delays, they cost a fortune with fees levied on both the sender and receiver of the funds, and, on top of that, require lots of administrative duties. International cross-currency payments could not be more expensive or cumbersome if they tried. With Remittix, payments clear almost instantly and cost a fraction of the price. As for the paperwork, what paperwork!? This means global transactions are much more economical and now possible where previously it would have been impractical. Remittix greases the wheels of trade and industry, opens up the free markets and even gives the world’s unbanked a chance to partake in the formal economy. For companies, this reduced hassle and overheads will greatly impact the bottom line, giving all parties an easier path to economic freedom. Remittix is now in presale and has gained over $15.3 million in liquidity thus far. Once the presale ends and the token goes mainstream, its use case could propel Remittix into the top-ranked coins. Even YouTube is enthused about the potential behind Remittix. Conclusion Cardano will always have a place in the cryptosphere and it has some institutional support, but from an investment perspective, Cardano just is not worth it anymore. Remittix , however, is taking up the slack and thanks to its massive use case and unique market positioning, Remittix could be the best-performing token of the year. Remittix is now available at $0.781 directly from their website.

2025-05-25T08:35:31.000Z,"XRP News: As Bitcoin & Ethereum Rally, Investors Flock To XpFinance, The First Lending & Borrowing Platform On The $XRP Ledger","Bitcoin has hit its all time high and Ethereum poised to break new yearly highs as the broader crypto market is awash in fresh liquidity. While notable altcoins gain the headlines, an emerging project on the XRP Ledger is quietly capturing the imagination of forward-looking investors. XpFinance , the first fully decentralized lending and borrowing protocol engineered specifically for XRP, has already filled more than twenty percent of its one-hundred-thousand XRP presale soft cap in only a few days. Buy XPF Tokens Market participants who booked profits during the recent Bitcoin and Ethereum surge are actively rotating capital into early-stage opportunities with strong fundamentals and real utility. XpFinance is quickly becoming the top destination for that capital. By delivering a noncustodial lending engine that harnesses XRP Ledger speed and near-zero fees, the protocol positions itself as the missing cornerstone of decentralized finance on XRPL. A clear solution to XRP’s DeFi gap Centralized lenders have dominated the XRP landscape for years, often charging opaque fees and forcing users to surrender custody of their coins. XpFinance eliminates those pain points through an on-chain architecture that gives users full control over their assets at every step. Loans are overcollateralized, transparently managed by smart contracts, and settled in seconds through XRP Ledger consensus. Investors who hold the native XPF token receive three immediate advantages. First, borrowing fees drop significantly for token holders, creating tangible savings for active users. Second, a share of all protocol fees is distributed to stakers in XRP, establishing a stable passive-income stream. Third, governance rights allow the XpFinance community to vote on new collateral assets, interest curves, and strategic upgrades, ensuring that platform evolution remains user centric. Joining Xpfinance Presale offer an instant upside XpFinance has reserved sixty million XPF , exactly thirty percent of the fixed two-hundred-million supply, for its limited presale. Tokens are sold at a transparent price of one XRP for two-hundred XPF. Upon the conclusion of the sale, XPF will list directly on XPMarket, the leading decentralized exchange on XRPL, at one XRP for one-hundred-forty XPF. Early buyers therefore secure a built-in thirty percent price advantage the moment public trading begins. Join Xpfinance Presale First look demo coming next week The development team has confirmed that a working demonstration of the lending dashboard will be released next week. Prospective users will be able to connect an XRPL wallet, simulate deposits, and preview real-time loan creation inside a web interface that mirrors the final production version. The demo is expected to serve as a powerful catalyst for the remaining presale phases, as investors will see first hand how fast and easy decentralized lending on XRP can be. How to participate in the Xpfinance presale Purchase XRP on a reputable exchange such as Binance, Coinbase, or Bybit. Transfer XRP to a self-custody wallet that supports trust lines, for example Xaman, XUMM, or Ledger Nano. Visit the official presale portal at xp.finance/presale and send XRP to the address displayed. Add the XPF trust line in your wallet so tokens are delivered automatically when the sale closes. The presale is filling rapidly. Analysts who track on-chain inflows expect the soft cap to be met well ahead of schedule and anticipate strong demand once XPF goes live on decentralized exchanges. About XpFinance XpFinance is building the first noncustodial money market on the XRP Ledger. The project’s mission is to unlock idle XRP liquidity, provide frictionless borrowing, and distribute protocol governance to a global community of token holders. By merging the speed of XRPL with a transparent fee model, XpFinance aims to set a new standard for decentralized finance. Secure your allocation before the window closes and position yourself at the forefront of the XRP DeFi renaissance.

While ADA’s resilience and ongoing upgrades are impressive, the spotlight is increasingly shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin that’s rapidly establishing new support levels and capturing attention as a top early-stage contender for 2025. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, 50% Bonus, and New Support Zones MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating early-stage watchlists, with Stage 8 live and over $8 million raised as demand accelerates. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling unprecedented buy activity.Key reasons investors are watching MAGA closely: Political narrative that energizes the community and drives organic growth. Early-stage positioning with robust tokenomics and a limited supply structure. Rapid stage progress —Stage 8 is nearly full, with a $0.007 listing target and analyst forecasts pointing to 15,000%–18,500% upside if momentum holds. Early participants can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those seeking exponential returns.

Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Momentum and Market Foundation Bitcoin is holding firm above $110,000, with technicals showing a bullish bias and institutional inflows supporting the current uptrend. Analysts expect BTC to test $113,000–$115,500 by the end of May, with a breakout potentially extending gains into June. While Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, its upside is now more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Kaspa (KAS): Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Kaspa is trading around $0.089, with analysts forecasting a range of $0.059–$0.119 for May 2025. While KAS’s fundamentals and unique GHOSTDAG protocol are attracting attention, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. Ethereum (ETH): Stability and Institutional Confidence Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a possible breakout above $2,700. Institutional inflows and Layer 2 growth continue to support ETH’s long-term outlook, but its near-term trajectory is steady compared to the rapid momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Cardano’s strength above $0.75 and Bitcoin’s bullish momentum are impressive, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE.

2025-05-25T08:30:45.000Z,"Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Healthy – Data Shows No Signs Of Overheating","Bitcoin is wrapping up the week with strength, trading above the $105,000 mark after a sharp rally that pushed prices to a new all-time high near $112,000. The move reignited bullish momentum across the market, with traders and analysts now turning their focus to what could be the next phase of this cycle. Related Reading: Tron Bulls Regain Control – On-Chain Data Shows Fresh Buying Pressure Despite the aggressive push higher, on-chain data suggests the market remains healthy. Top analyst Darkfost highlighted that net realized profits are still within normal levels for a bull run. According to his analysis, profit-taking is not a sign of weakness—it’s a necessary part of market structure during uptrends. “This is what keeps investors engaged and prevents parabolic exhaustion,” he noted. The recent price action points to a potential shift in market dynamics, as Bitcoin breaks out of its post-halving consolidation phase. With weekly support forming above $105K and realized profit metrics staying in check, bulls are eyeing higher levels. If this momentum holds, the $112K rejection may only be a short-term hurdle. As always, volatility remains in play—but this week’s close sends a strong signal: the bull market structure is still intact. Bitcoin Has Room To Grow As It Prepares For Historic Weekly Close Bitcoin is on track to record its highest weekly close in history, signaling growing strength as it prepares for what many believe could be the next major bullish phase. After surging to a new all-time high near $112,000 earlier this week, BTC is now stabilizing above the $105,000 level—positioning itself above key short-term support going into next week. Still, while price action paints a bullish picture, macroeconomic conditions continue to pose risks. High interest rates, tightening financial conditions, and broader market uncertainty remain major factors. Investors are cautiously optimistic, but volatility could quickly return if global risk sentiment deteriorates. On-chain data offers a more grounded view of the current cycle. According to Darkfost, CryptoQuant data shows that realized profits currently stand at 104,000 BTC, or around $11 billion. While that number may seem large, it’s still well below the historical danger zone of 350,000 BTC—a level that typically signals euphoric conditions or overheating. This suggests the market remains in a healthy profit-taking zone. “Profit-taking is not a red flag during a bull market,” Darkfost noted. “It’s necessary. It helps maintain momentum and keeps participants engaged.” The coming week will be critical. A confirmed weekly close above $105K could solidify this level as new support and set the stage for further upside. But if bulls fail to hold ground, the rally risks losing steam. For now, Bitcoin appears strong, but the market is entering a zone where conviction will be tested. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back To Daily EMA 8 – Can Bulls Hold Momentum? BTC Holds Key Support After Rejection From New ATH Bitcoin is currently trading around $107,750 after a volatile week that saw prices hit a new all-time high near $112,000. The daily chart shows BTC pulling back from overbought conditions but holding firmly above the 34-day EMA at $100,886—a level that has consistently acted as dynamic support during this uptrend. Price remains well above the 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, confirming a strong bullish structure. The key horizontal support at $103,600—now reclaimed—is another crucial zone. This level previously acted as a resistance ceiling during the March-April range and now serves as a potential launchpad if BTC consolidates above it. Volume appears to be declining slightly on the pullback, which may suggest this is a healthy retrace rather than a reversal. As long as Bitcoin maintains above the $103,600–$105,000 zone, bulls remain in control. A deeper correction would find initial support around the 34 EMA and then the 100 SMA near $91,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger For now, the bullish trend remains intact. However, rejection at $112K and slowing momentum call for caution. A weekly close above $105K would confirm strength, while a break below $103K could trigger short-term weakness.

2025-05-25T08:25:28.000Z,"Scammers Send Fake Ledger Letters in Latest Crypto Phishing Scheme","Key Takeaways: Scammers are mailing fake Ledger letters via USPS, urging crypto users to “validate” wallets to steal private keys. Physical phishing tactics mark a shift from online-only attacks, raising new concerns for crypto security. Fake Ledger Live apps are targeting macOS users with trojanized malware designed to steal recovery phrases. A new phishing scam is targeting crypto holders through traditional mail, with scammers impersonating hardware wallet maker Ledger and sending fake letters urging users to “validate” their wallets or risk losing access to funds. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe was among the first to flag the attack, sharing an image of the fraudulent letter, which included a QR code — likely linked to a phishing site designed to steal private keys. Crypto Scammers Turn to USPS in Shift to Physical Phishing Attacks The letters have reportedly been delivered via the United States Postal Service (USPS), signaling a shift in tactics from digital to physical social engineering. Troy Lindsey, another recipient of the letter, warned others on social media: “These are all scams. Do not fall for any of these.” I got the same one last week I took and had @grok analyze it. These are all scams do not fall for any of these!! pic.twitter.com/ZFNpQpujqA — Troy Lindsey (@TroyandOlga) May 24, 2025 The warning echoes growing concerns about phishing schemes that leverage physical credibility to trick crypto users into exposing sensitive data. The attack comes amid a rise in crypto-related phishing cases. In April, $330 million in Bitcoin was stolen from an elderly victim, a heist confirmed by blockchain investigator ZackXBT. He linked the crime to individuals operating from a scam call center in Camden, UK. Meanwhile, Coinbase disclosed earlier this month that it was the target of a ransom attempt after customer support contractors leaked user data. The attackers demanded $20 million, which the exchange refused to pay. While Coinbase stated that no private keys or account access were compromised, the leaked data included names and contact information. TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington criticized the exchange , warning that breaches of this kind could lead to real-world harm for exposed customers. Fake Ledger Live Apps Target macOS Users Last week, cybersecurity firm Moonlock warned that a wave of malware attacks targeting macOS users is exploiting trust in Ledger Live, a popular crypto wallet management app. Moonlock warned that malicious actors are using trojanized clones of Ledger Live to trick users into entering their recovery phrases through convincing pop-ups. “Within a year, they have learned to steal seed phrases and empty the wallets of their victims,” the team stated, noting a major evolution in the threat. One of the primary infection vectors is the Atomic macOS Stealer, a tool designed to exfiltrate sensitive data such as passwords, notes, and crypto wallet details. Moonlock discovered it embedded across at least 2,800 compromised websites. Once installed, the malware quietly replaces the genuine Ledger Live app with a fake one that triggers fake alerts to harvest seed phrases. The moment a user enters their 24-word recovery phrase into the phony app, the information is sent to servers controlled by the attacker.

Following Bitcoin’s surge past $111,000. Farina compared potential returns from Bitcoin to those from XRP. He emphasized that buying Bitcoin at current levels and expecting it to reach $500,000 would yield only a 355% gain, whereas buying XRP at $2.40 and seeing it rise to $100 would result in a 4,066% gain. “Make the right choices,” he concluded, suggesting that while Bitcoin may seem like a good option, a critical look at both assets shows that XRP will give much better returns. Let’s do some math: Buy BTC at $110K, it goes to $500K → ~355% gain Buy XRP at $2.40, it goes to $100 → 4,066% gain Make the right choices!

He argues that most crypto holders do not own a full Bitcoin and are unlikely to see life-changing returns from the asset at current prices. According to Farina, “Most investors don’t even have $10,000 in their bank accounts,” and buying BTC now provides limited growth potential compared to alternative digital assets. This limited growth is clear when comparing both assets, as a recent analysis showed that XRP has grown 490% since 2022 , while Bitcoin has risen by only 10%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Manipulation Concerns and Utility-Based Alternatives Farina argues Bitcoin’s surge is driven by propaganda and low liquidity, not real demand. He claims manipulation via Tether (USDT) skews prices, and public celebration over Bitcoin reaching six figures is misplaced, as most investors won’t benefit. Farina highlights XRP, XLM, HBAR, and Algorand as better risk-reward plays, citing their real-world utility and lower market caps. He notes XRP’s rise from $0.50 to $2.40 as a strong example. He believes buying XRP at current prices is a no-brainer , and contrasts its growth with Bitcoin’s 30% gain during the same timeframe, despite significantly higher volatility and far lower upside. Questioning Bitcoin’s Long-Term Viability Farina questions Bitcoin’s long-term viability, citing high fees, poor scalability, and criticism from institutions like the IMF and ECB. He claims utility-based assets like XRP and XLM have more potential. He recalls selling his car to invest in Bitcoin at $16,000, only to cash out at $64,000 for a 4x return. He says those gains were modest compared to his returns from XRP bought at lower prices. For new investors, he sees limited upside and advises focusing on undervalued projects with real-world use , not hype-driven legacy assets, as Bitcoin’s big gains have been in the past.

HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Accelerating Presale, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as 2025’s most dynamic presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling record demand from both retail and institutional investors.Key highlights: Scarcity-Driven Model: Only 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to presale, creating a strong supply squeeze as demand rises. Community Surge: Over 20,000 holders and growing, with social buzz and presale trackers consistently ranking MAGA as a top pick. 50% Bonus: Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus, amplifying upside ahead of the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. With every stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trendline is steepening—making it the cycle’s breakout contender before listings ignite true price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Sideways Action and Steady Inflows Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals hinting at a possible breakout above $2,700 if bullish sentiment returns. Institutional inflows remain robust, and analysts expect ETH to test $2,800–$2,900 in June. While ETH remains a foundational asset, its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the rapid acceleration seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Upside Potential Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 and even $200 if momentum persists. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract capital, but the most aggressive traders are now rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. Aptos (APT): Quiet Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Aptos is trading around $4.09, with forecasts suggesting a range of $2.79 to $5.38 for May 2025. While APT’s fundamentals remain solid, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with strong institutional support and technicals pointing to a possible move toward $115,000 if momentum hold. As BTC’s growth steadies, more investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins—where MAGACOIN FINANCE is now leading sentiment and capital flows. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Ethereum’s sideways movement is providing a stable backdrop, but the steepest trendline belongs to MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus , and analyst forecasts up to 35x–50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout name to watch as Q3 approaches.

Many altcoins have posted notable gains on a weekly scale, led by HYPE, while SUI and XRP have retraced the most from the larger caps. BTC to $108K It all began last Sunday evening when BTC broke out of its weekend calmness and shot up from $103,000 to almost $107,000. It faced immediate resistance there and was pushed south on Monday. The scenario repeated once again as the business week progressed, but the bulls took complete control of the market on Wednesday. After a minor pullback, the cryptocurrency went hard on the offensive in the afternoon and jumped past $109,100 to market a new all-time high. The bears were quick to intercept and drove bitcoin back down to $106,500, but that was another short-lived correction. By Thursday morning, BTC had resumed its run and skyrocketed to almost $112,000 (on Pizza Day) to register a new all-time high. More volatility ensued on Friday when US President Trump recommended new tariffs against the EU, and bitcoin slipped by several grand almost immediately. It now trades at around $108,000 after a quiet weekend , but it’s still 4% up weekly. Its market cap remains close to $2.150 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is above 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Volatile Alts The altcoins seem to be led by a new megastar: HYPE. Its price charted a new all-time high on Friday, and even a compromised Hyperliquid X account couldn’t halt its momentum. It’s up by 30% on a weekly scale and has become the top performer. AAVE follows suit with a 19% weekly jump, while XMR is third with a 17.7% such increase. PEPE and BCH are next in line. In contrast, SUI has dropped by 5% since this time last Sunday, and XRP has slipped to $2.3 after a 2.8% weekly decline. The total crypto market cap has shed around $30 billion since yesterday and is down to $3.5 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 66,400 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is at risk of repeating its 2021 bull market top, when BTC lost all momentum after failing to rally above a cycle high of about $69,000. “We had a breakout [at $60,000 in 2021]. You really don’t want to see that breakout get stuffed. And the moment we closed below $60,000, I was like, ‘Okay, this is kind of [messed up].” Source: DonAlt/YouTube After Bitcoin failed to hold $60,000 in November 2021, BTC witnessed a multi-month downtrend that drove the crypto king to prices below $20,000. Now, DonAlt is warning that Bitcoin might be in a similar position as it struggles to convincingly take out its last resistance at $110,000. “And you can argue the same here. I don’t necessarily think $104,000 is good enough, but it would be an early warning sign if we start losing it. And then you can make the comparison easier. And then a little bit of a better warning sign, I think, is around $100,000, where we start getting into danger territory. And then if we start dipping down there, all bets are off, and then time to run probably.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $107,590.

2025-05-25T07:01:10.000Z,"Crypto investor charged with kidnapping, torturing an Italian for passwords","A Manhattan crypto investor is facing serious charges after allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian man in a disturbing bid to extract access to digital assets. John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month. According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice. The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse. Source: Mario Nawfal Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investors Crypto victim beaten, electroshocked The victim described being beaten, shocked with electricity, assaulted with a firearm and even dangled from the upper floors of the five-story building. He also told police that Woeltz used a saw to cut his leg and forced him to smoke crack cocaine. Threats were also reportedly made against his family. Photographic evidence found inside the property, including Polaroids, appears to support claims of sustained abuse. The victim managed to escape on Friday and alert authorities, leading to Woeltz’s arrest. Woeltz was charged with four felony counts, including kidnapping for ransom, and entered a plea of not guilty. Judge Eric Schumacher ordered him to be held without bail. He is expected back in court on May 28. A 24-year-old woman was also taken into custody on Friday in connection with the incident. However, she was seen walking freely in New York the next day, and no charges against her were found in the court’s online database. Authorities have yet to clarify the relationship between the suspect and the victim or whether any cryptocurrency was ultimately stolen.

Yet, as the market’s attention sharpens, early-stage capital is rotating into Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE—two assets now highlighted for their explosive upside potential in the next cycle. Bitcoin, XRP, and Litecoin round out the list of key names to watch as Q3 2025 approaches. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, 50% Bonus, and 10,600%+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the breakout presale of 2025 , with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full.

Secure and transparent: HashEx-audited contracts and rapid community growth. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Structure and Institutional Inflows Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a potential breakout above $2,700 if bullish sentiment holds. The network’s resilience and growing institutional adoption are fueling optimism, with price forecasts for June targeting $2,700–$2,900. While ETH remains a core holding, its near-term upside is now being matched by the rapid acceleration of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is trading above $108,000, with strong institutional demand and technical support at $107,000–$111,000. While BTC remains the market’s foundation, its upside is increasingly seen as more measured, prompting many investors to diversify into high-growth altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Volatility and Rotating Capital XRP is consolidating between $2.35 and $2.65, with analysts forecasting a move to $2.80–$3.40 if momentum returns. However, short-term volatility and profit-taking pressure have led many traders to seek sharper returns in early-stage projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Litecoin (LTC): Bullish Signs, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Litecoin is holding above $90, with technicals suggesting a bullish continuation toward $100–$110. While LTC remains a reliable hold, its upside is less dramatic than the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE.

2025-05-25T07:00:32.000Z,"Bitcoin To $125K By End Of Q2? Bold Call From Bybit Executive","Bitcoin could climb higher before June wraps up, if today’s momentum holds. According to Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, the world’s second-largest crypto exchange, a move to $125,000 by the end of Q2 is on the table. That’s a jump of about 16% from current levels near $108,000. It’s a bold call, but Jan ties it to clear rules, steady fund flows and a sliding US dollar. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Bitcoin: Bold Price Forecast Jan set the $125,000 target in a market update on Thursday. He argues that if big players keep buying, Bitcoin can make that climb from roughly $108,100 today to $125,000 in five weeks. It’s a tight window. The weeks ahead will matter most as prices test new highs and traders look for clues on follow-through. Bybit’s Head of Derivatives Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $125K by End of Q2 — WF (@WhaleFUD) May 24, 2025 Three Main Drivers Regulatory clarity tops Jan’s list. Based on reports, the new GENIUS Act gives stablecoins defined rules, which could help banks and funds feel safer about crypto. He also mentions spot Bitcoin ETFs. These funds have pulled in fresh capital, offering a straight path for institutions to own Bitcoin. Finally, Jan points to a weaker US dollar. When the dollar dips, Bitcoin often shines as an alternative store of value, his view goes. Altcoin Outlook Mixed While Bitcoin gets the green light, Jan warns that smaller tokens may struggle. He says high interest rates and global uncertainty might limit gains for Ethereum and other major altcoins. If money slows or risk appetite wanes, altcoins could lag behind Bitcoin’s rally. Traders aiming beyond BTC may need to pick their spots more carefully. Other Expert Predictions Jan’s view isn’t alone. Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast, thinks Bitcoin could hit $250,000 by December 31, 2025. He notes BTC’s volatility has fallen from about three times that of the S&P to under two times. On another front, Adam Back of Blockstream sees an even steeper climb to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin this cycle. Michael Saylor, CEO of Strategy, adds that recent hiccups below $150,000 are tied to short-term holders exiting. He says longer-term investors are moving in through spot ETFs and corporate buys.

2025-05-25T06:36:53.000Z,"Ripple CEO declares crypto ETFs the gateway to financial power","In a special “Crypto in One Minute” episode, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse spoke on the growing momentum of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) when answering, “Why are Crypto ETFs exciting?” He described them as a new gateway to crypto markets, particularly for institutional investors. Garlinghouse emphasizes the ETF’s pivotal role in bridging traditional finance with the burgeoning crypto industry. Ripple’s CEO argued that ETFs institutionalized the crypto industry Speaking on Ripple’s “Crypto in One Minute” podcast episode, Garlinghouse explained two key reasons behind the increasing momentum for crypto ETFs. First, he claimed ETFs offered a direct trading option for institutional investors. Before these exchange-traded funds, investors could only trade through exchanges or self-custody, and ETFs changed that. He commented, “This was really the first time you had institutions be able to go on Wall Street and trade directly in crypto.” He added that ETFs allow capital previously excluded to enter the market through a familiar and regulated structure, enabling institutional investors to avoid the complexities and risks of self-custody and centralized exchanges. Second, he argued that ETFs are institutionalizing the crypto industry, changing perception among traditional investors. He even cited Bitcoin ETFs as evidence, hinting that investors view these crypto products as legitimate asset classes similar to gold ETFs. So far, multiple institutions have submitted filings to the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), seeking approval for their XRP, Litecoin, Solana, and Dogecoin spot ETFs. Many crypto analysts believe the SEC will most likely approve spot XRP ETFs next. According to Polymarket, traders are placing the probability of a Ripple spot XRP ERF being approved in 2025 at 83%. CME’s head of crypto products, Giovanni Vicioso, agreed that interest in XRP has risen, adding that market participants are seeking regulated derivatives tied to a broader array of digital assets. Garlinghouse’s comments are making the rounds on social media, with many lauding his ability to articulate how game-changing the crypto ETFs’ on-boarding of institutions could be. These developments come as the crypto ETF market matures in a defining moment for embedding digital assets into traditional financial systems. Volatility Shares introduced Ripple-backed XRP Futures ETF Recently, Volatility Shares launched its XRP Futures ETF. According to their SEC filing on May 21, the ETF will indirectly invest in the future of the Ripple-linked token via its Cayman Islands subsidiary. The new product, $XRPI, will also invest at least 80% of its net assets in XRP-linked instruments, including futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Volatility Shares is preparing to release a 2x XRP futures ETF, designed to deliver twice the daily returns of XRP by providing double leveraged exposure to XRP futures. Teucrium already launched a 2X XRP ETF in April and trades roughly $35 million daily. Seeing Teucrium’s success, Balchunas believes there will be good demand for Volatility Shares 2X XRP ETF. John Deaton argues Ripple executives could be excellent picks for a crypto Mount Rushmore Lawyer John Deaton believes some of Ripple’s executives could make the cut for a crypto Mount Rushmore for their contributions to the crypto industry. Deaton explained that Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb could be a perfect pick for the crypto Mount Rushmore for his efforts in creating XRP and the XRP ledger. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also caught the lawyer’s attention for his work in developing the XRP ledger and an early patent predating blockchain technology. Deaton also mentioned Ripple CEO Brad GarlingHouse for launching the RLUSD stablecoin and acquiring Hidden Road . Also on Deaton’s list were the anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He argued that Buterin makes a list for introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Deaton also named Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, and Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long as potential candidates.

2025-05-25T06:33:13.000Z,"Bitcoin to $121K Next Week? Mega Whale Wynn Bet $1.25B on It","After recently hitting a new all-time high, Bitcoin (BTC) has retraced to the $108,000 level. Still, one whale is betting billions that the number one cryptocurrency will defy the chaos caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff bombshell and rocket to $121,000 within days. The $1.25B Gamble High-stakes trader James Wynn, known for his jaw-dropping leverages, has doubled down on a $1.25 billion BTC long position with 40x leverage, despite a rollercoaster week that saw his unrealized losses briefly hit $321 million. “THE SWINGS ARE INSANE,” Wynn tweeted Thursday after clawing back to a slim profit. “WHALES WANT ME GONE!!!” According to market tracker Lookonchain, his liquidation price is $105,180, which, at Bitcoin’s current value, is just a 3.5% dip away from total wipeout. However, the razor-thin margins seem not to have affected the trader’s bullishness, proclaiming a target for BTC in the coming week. “$118k – $121k next week,” he posted on X Saturday morning, doubling down even as volatility surged. Not long after, he returned to the social platform, sharing a screenshot showing $4.2 million in unrealized profit on one of his trades, which had earlier been $59 million underwater. “Built different,” the self-described meme coin maxi flexed. Can the Market Keep Up? But not everyone is buying the hype. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades called Wynn’s trade “insanity,” arguing that closing even a fraction of his position could shift Bitcoin’s price. “Every 1% BTC candle equals a $10M PNL swing,” he warned. Another pseudonymous market watcher, Innerdevcrypto, speculated that Wynn’s public bravado might be a play for clout. “That liquidation price is too close,” he pointed out. “I wonder if there is not some ulterior motive to him doing this.” To add fuel to the fire, President Trump’s latest tariff threats, including a 50% import tax on EU goods and a 25% Apple-specific levy, have shaken global markets. Bitcoin slipped over 3% on Friday, briefly dipping to around $107,600, with crypto intelligence platform Santiment warning the development had caused traders to change strategies to “holding and ‘hoping for the best.’” Meanwhile, Lookonchain revealed that Wynn had dumped his ETH and SUI longs, burning $5.3 million in losses, to go all-in on BTC. That kind of conviction, or recklessness, depending on your point of view, has set the stage for what is sure to be an interesting new week. Will the maverick whale’s $121,000 prediction come true to see him win big, or will he be eaten alive by the sharks circling around $105,000? UPDATE: More recent data from Lookonchain, though, shows that Wynn closed the entire $1.25 billion long position a few hours ago, which even caused a price slip for BTC on Hyperliquid.

Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said.“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.”Source: Gerard RennickBitcoiners across the world were quick to respond to Rennick’s comments. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) said Rennick’s remarks about “Bitcoin reveal a deep misunderstanding.” The ABIB added:“This matters, because misunderstanding leads to misrepresentation. And misrepresentation leads to bad policy.”Unchained podcast host Laura Shin said, “You also can’t eat the internet, so do you oppose that too?” Bitcoin Marathon team lead Jimmy Kostro said, “This is definitely going to age well. Please enlighten us with more of your deep and nuanced understanding of Bitcoin.”Source: CoinvisionRennick responded to the criticism and said he doesn’t “need to explain anything.”“It’s pathetic how the Bitcoin community needs reassurance from a politician - the very people they claim they want to be free from,” Rennick said.The Bitcoin community has frequently spoken out when prominent individuals have expressed anti-Bitcoin views.

Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.Cathie Wood spoke to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas at Solana Accelerate on May 23. Source: SolanaSince spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US in January 2024, approximately $44.49 billion in inflows have been recorded, according to Farside data. Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs have seen approximately $2.77 billion in inflows since launching in July 2024.Wood said that spot Ether ETFs were “less successful than people were expecting” because the US Securities and Exchange Commission did not allow staking. On May 21, the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund.However, Wood still views Ether as the entry point for new investors to familiarize themselves with smart contracts before exploring other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL). “So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” Wood said.Related: ‘We are worried about a recession,’ but there’s a silver lining — Cathie WoodWood said that the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), in January on the Solana network may have caused investors to be skeptical of Solana.“Institutions and you’re saying 60-year-olds…I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” Wood said. Just days after its launch on Jan. 17, TRUMP slid around 50% after the president made no crypto-related “day one” executive orders.“I mean, that might scare them,” Wood said. Her comments came in response to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterating the point that Bitcoin is “so easy” to explain to a “boomer or adviser” as being digital gold, but other cryptocurrencies “are tougher.”Wood said her Solana price target is in progress and that she will share it once the research is complete. In April, ARK raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, primarily driven by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as “digital gold.”Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-etfs-wallets-bitcoin-solana-ether-ark-invest-cathie-wood?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-24T20:26:01.000Z,"Bitcoin inflows projected to reach $420B in 2026 — Bitwise","Key takeaways:Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It’s not taking place here at the White House.”Related: Pictures give glimpse inside Trump’s memecoin holder dinnerTrump features presidential seal at private propertiesThis isn’t the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties.

Eisenberg was in Puerto Rico at the time of the trades, and the court found that no meaningful activity tied to the alleged crime occurred in New York.The DOJ had cited a Poughkeepsie-based Mango user and a third-party vendor in Manhattan, but the judge ruled these were not enough to establish proper venue.The US government must now decide whether to refile the vacated charges, though the Trump administration has recently signaled a reduced focus on crypto enforcement. Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material chargesEisenberg charged with child pornographyIn a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico.

The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership.

Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization.

The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections.   Related: Ukraine strategic Bitcoin reserve bill reportedly in final stagesOn May 6, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte was the first to sign a Bitcoin reserve bill into law. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs later approved a law allowing the state to claim ownership of unclaimed crypto.

2025-05-23T20:00:00.000Z,"Crypto Biz: From shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar to shorting the US dollar","When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo.Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructureBanco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily.SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services.Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik.Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claimsAmerica’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell.In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets. At the time of its launch, the YLDS stablecoin offered a yield of 3.85%.Pi Protocol and Spark Protocol have also developed interest-bearing tokens. Source: Austin CampbellStrategy continues to stack satsWith Bitcoin back above $100,000, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm, Strategy, has resumed its buying spree by acquiring 7,390 BTC last week for approximately $765 million.The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, with an unrealized gain of around $20 billion.The announcement came just two days before Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time high, climbing above $109,000 for the first time since January.

Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.”May 22 letter to DOJ official calling for investigation into Trump memecoin dinner.

That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:52:03.000Z,"Who attended Trump’s controversial memecoin dinner?","The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.However, some attendees spoke to the press or took to social media to talk about the dinner. Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why?

Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit.

With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice?

Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.

2025-05-23T08:47:40.000Z,"DeFi near-zero onboarding costs can help 1.4B unbanked: 1inch co-founder","Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have a major cost advantage over traditional banks when it comes to onboarding new users, according to Anton Bukov, co-founder of decentralized exchange (DEX) 1inch.Speaking at a panel during Dutch Blockchain Week on May 22 in Amsterdam, Bukov said traditional banks spend between $100 and $300 per user to verify documents and set up accounts. Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.On May 20, the US Senate voted 66-32 in favor of advancing discussion on the stablecoin-regulating Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The bill outlines a regulatory framework for stablecoin collateralization and mandates compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. The bill is now headed to debate on the Senate floor.Earlier this week, White House crypto czar David Sacks said he expects the bill will be passed and that it will receive bipartisan support.However, high-ranking Democrats plan to amend the bill to include a clause prohibiting President Donald Trump and other US officials from profiting from stablecoins.Trump and his family launched the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, which created the USD1 stablecoin in March.

It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices.Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.Total Bitcoin futures OI. Source: CoinglassWhen OI surges, it indicates massive leveraged positions are built up in the market, with lots of traders holding large positions with borrowed money. If Bitcoin’s price moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated, and the flushout can create selling pressure on Bitcoin, which can cause a rapid drop in prices and high volatility.However, analysts suggest the surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which have seen more than $2.5 billion this week, can counter some of that extended leverage.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s MersingerBitcoin options markets show a similar pattern with open interest over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Ives simply referred to them as a “new design movement” that would be similar to Apple’s family of hardware and software integrations. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from investors, who view the company as a stalwart in the AI industry following the overwhelming success of its ChatGPT large language model (LLM). As of May, ChatGPT had nearly 800 million weekly active users, according to industry data. These usage trends were behind OpenAI’s massive $157 billion valuation as of October 2024 — a figure that nearly doubled to $300 billion by March 2025.ChatGPT usage trends.

It’s unclear whether the new social media platform would launch as a standalone product or be incorporated into ChatGPT.The blend between AI and social media has also bled into the blockchain industry, with several startups utilizing these technologies to build AI agents, LLM tools and decentralized social media networks.As Cointelegraph reported, Validation Cloud recently deployed an LLM on the Hedera network, giving decentralized finance users the ability to query blockchain data more easily. Related: OpenAI’s Altman appears to reject Musk’s $97.4B bid for control",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/openai-100-million-pocket-sized-ai-devices-everyday-use?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.Solana 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated. The support range is a daily order block, which should provide higher time frame (HTF) support in case of a price correction. Related: Bitcoin could go much higher due to lack of FOMO and futures market euphoria — AnalystsSolana price fractal aims for $260Crypto trader Robert Mercer shared a chart identifying a price fractal pattern similar to October 2024.

Source: CoinalyzeThe chart illustrates that the current BTC funding rate is significantly below previous market highs observed during March and November 2024. The funding rate was six times higher in Q1 and three times higher in Q4 last year.These low rates indicate minimal speculative activity in the futures market, with the rally driven by spot buyers rather than leveraged traders, reducing the risk of over-leveraged corrections. Such a scenario also indicates that Bitcoin might not have reached a state of euphoria yet. The availability of untapped liquidity in the crypto ecosystem underscores the potential for further growth.
