2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin bottleneck: Demand outmints supply, who’s to blame?","A dramatic supply crunch is reshaping the Bitcoin market as institutional investors ramp up purchases, hoard millions of coins, and dry up available liquidity. With daily corporate acquisitions far outpacing mining output, experts warn of a looming imbalance that could redefine Bitcoin’s role from a volatile asset to a strategic reserve. New forecasts predict trillions of dollars in institutional inflows, while long-term holders and governments show no intention of selling. As centralized exchanges run dry and regulation looms, Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be on the brink of a structural transformation—one that could permanently limit access to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. 2,000 bitcoins a day? Bitcoin treasury company Strategy buys over 2,000 bitcoins on average daily, while miners produce only 450 units per day. The real gap is much higher as more institutions join the Bitcoin race. How this impacts the future of Bitcoin remains to be seen, but a new report provides a clue. UTXO’s Guillaume Girard and Will Owens predict that by the end of 2025, institutions will invest $130 billion in Bitcoin. In 2026, this amount will grow to $300 billion. According to Girard and Owens, the total amount of bitcoins purchased by institutions will hit 4.2 million, which is 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply (if we don’t take millions of lost bitcoins into consideration). https://twitter.com/RichardByworth/status/1925645051633303630?t=eUnI45wGSBfAABKnMZJzIQ&s=35 According to the Bitcoin Treasuries website, as of May 2025, 3.35 million bitcoins were held in corporate, state, and various other treasuries. Only nearly 800,000 bitcoins are held on corporate balance sheets now. How is Bitcoin getting sold off from the circulation? According to Strategy chair Michael Saylor, the company is not going to sell any of its bitcoins. Assuming Strategy and other entities copying its playbook won’t be selling bitcoins, then we should acknowledge that Bitcoin’s supply is shrinking at an ever-increasing speed. As governments, along with private and public companies, continue to buy bitcoins without the intention of selling, more coins will disappear from circulation at an ever-growing speed. https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1921143381440283077 CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju claims that Bitcoin’s annual deflation rate is -2.23% thanks to Strategy’s activity. In the first third of 2025, corporations purchased 196,000 BTC while the mined amount is only around 60,044 BTC. The amount acquired by long-term holding companies already outperformed the entire amount of bitcoins projected to be mined in 2025 (164,250 BTC). As the new Bitcoin treasuries continue to occur (Nakamoto and 21 Capital are the latest high-profile launches), Bitcoin will increasingly lose liquid supply. The market situation may drastically change. According to the UTXO forecast, 2026 may see less volatility, increased transparency or reserves, and a change of Bitcoin’s role from a seized asset to a strategic reserve asset. Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (“BTCfi”) platforms will allegedly get bigger. The new era may see drastically lower circulation of Bitcoin. Read more: The rise of BTCFi: From passive asset to financial powerhouse? | Opinion Much depends on regulation. At least two U.S. bills may seriously impact the Bitcoin sector: the Bitcoin Reserve Act, which suggests that the U.S. should purchase Bitcoin, and the Genius Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins, making it easier for institutions to enter the crypto markets. Furthermore, if they are adopted, various bills that establish state-level Bitcoin reserves may boost BTC purchasing as well. Supply shock and possible implications Centralized exchanges are running out of Bitcoin. In April 2025, its supply on exchanges was the lowest since November 2018. In 2025, exchanges lost 21% of BTC stored on their balances. Traders move their bitcoins to wallets and don’t seem to be eager to sell them. As of May 2025, nearly two-thirds of Bitcoin addresses have been motionless, at least since the beginning of the year. https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1924302191004676130 While many expect that institutional investors buying millions of bitcoins will push the BTC price up, not everyone believes so. Investor and trader Willy Woo doesn’t think that an institutional buy influx may drive the BTC price. He explains that institutional investors buying large amounts of Bitcoin offset risks through parallel respective short sells. https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1924717563378073855?t=W1s1ARRziHPpNBvL95Dsnw&s=35 High demand, shrinking supply Matt Hougan, a CIO of Bitwise, predicts Bitcoin’s price may reach $200,000 in 2025. He says the gap between increasing demand and shrinking supply will also eliminate the four-year cycles with their several-fold ups and 90% drops. All in all, the Bitcoin supply shock is already here. Increased buyer pressure in the conditions of dropping supply may make the BTC price more stable or pave the way to new highs. Selling BTC at a preferred price will be easier; buying it back will become harder. Bitcoin may lose its vulnerability to macroeconomic factors and cement its reputation as a safe haven and strategic asset.

He tells us that individuals continue to be poor because they break what he calls the “two most important money laws.” Last week, Kiyosaki warned in an online announcement that fiat currency saving in dollars is no longer a safe wealth option. Instead, he advises investing in assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, which he views as being nearer to economic reality. Bitcoin and the Power of Networks Kiyosaki highlighted the importance of Metcalfe’s Law, which speaks about how network value increases exponentially with each new user. He mentioned profitable examples like FedEx and McDonald’s, compared to smaller, non-network businesses that cannot grow. “I invest in Bitcoin because it is a network. Most cryptos are not,” Kiyosaki stated. His message: don’t buy assets—invest in systems that appreciate with user adoption, because these are the true engines of long-term value. Why He Doesn’t Like the U.S. Dollar Kiyosaki reaffirmed his antipathy toward dollar savings, stating they’re “phony money.” Instead, he is a proponent of real and decentralized assets. His plan was guided by views from MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, who also advocates for Bitcoin as a store of wealth popular among the rich. Bond Market Warnings and Price Forecasts Kiyosaki further sounded warning alarms on the American bond market, stating that a recent Federal Reserve auction had no outside buyers, allegedly forcing the Fed to buy $50 billion of bonds with “phony money.” In consequence, he predicted price booms: Gold: $25,000 Silver: $70 Bitcoin: $500,000 to $1 million These predictions capture his inference that fiat-based financial systems are imploding—and only physical, scarce assets will endure. Final Thoughts Kiyosaki’s warning isn’t new, but it’s becoming louder: stop saving in fiat, invest in networks, and follow the real laws of money—or risk staying broke.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/kiyosaki-warns-savers-break-these-laws-and-you-stay-broke/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Blockchain|Regulation",cryptocompare
2025-05-25T19:30:02.000Z,"Bitwise CEO Spotlights Elon Musk Warning on Growing US Debt Amid Bitcoin Boost","Elon Musk, one of the richest men in the world, once again sparked debate with a bold warning about America’s growing debt. In a recent X post , the billionaire entrepreneur voiced deep concerns over the country’s financial future. Musk believes the U.S. could face bankruptcy if it does not take urgent steps to grow its productivity and reduce government spending. His remarks have drawn responses from other financial leaders, including Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, and sparked fresh interest in Bitcoin. Musk’s Call for Productivity Over Austerity Elon Musk thinks the United States can solve its money problem by increasing productivity. He believes that the economy will grow if people and companies in the U.S. become more productive. This could help the country avoid a financial collapse. Musk’s view also does not support strict spending cuts, also known as austerity. He believes those measures could hurt people and make things worse. Expert Says Inflation Is Reducing the Value of the Dollar Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley also responded to Musk’s comments. He says the U.S. dollar is losing value because of inflation and warned that it will keep getting weaker if the government does not act. Adding to this concern, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar’s strength against other currencies, has dropped by 10%. This means the dollar is not as strong as it used to be. A weak dollar can make imported goods more expensive and lower confidence in the U.S. economy. Notably, the ongoing trade war caused by Trump’s tariffs also adds to the economic strain. Experts warn that if the dollar continues to fall, more people and businesses might turn to other assets like Bitcoin. While many consider the flagship crypto a haven against inflation and economic turmoil, some are unconvinced about Bitcoin’s value. Australian Senator Gerard Rennick recently called Bitcoin a “Ponzi scheme,” which caused an uproar in the crypto space. Elon Musk Heads DOGE: A Push for Government Efficiency Elon Musk is helping lead a new government group called the Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE. This department was created to stop wasteful government spending and help officials spend public funds wisely. In February, DOGE targeted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), urging the public to report any evidence of “waste, fraud, and abuse” within the agency. Despite Musk’s broader push to root out inefficiencies in federal agencies, many say the efforts are not strong. Economist Peter Schiff, a staunch Bitcoin critic, says the government’s financial problems are already out of control. He believes a financial crisis has already begun in the United States, and DOGE may not be able to stop it.

2025-05-25T19:07:35.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Solana Ignites a Future of Universal Investing","At Accelerate 2025, Solana Foundation’s non-CMO Akshay BD laid out a vision that could redefine how we invest. He argued that tokenization on Solana will open private markets to anyone with a smartphone, shattering long-standing barriers for retail investors. This shift isn’t just about new tech—it represents a shift in economic power and wealth distribution. As blockchain blurs the line between asset owner and onlooker, savvy investors will seek the best crypto to buy now in anticipation of mainstream micro-ownership. Why Solana Believes Tokenization Is the Future of Everyday Investing Akshay BD, Solana Foundation’s non-Chief Marketing Officer, kicked off his Accelerate 2025 panel by highlighting a stark disconnect in today’s financial landscape: investors are increasingly uneasy. With bond yields stuck at historic lows and public markets flirting with bubble territory, traditional portfolios—think the old 60-40 split—haven’t delivered consistent returns in years. Investment managers report a nagging anxiety among clients who feel boxed in by a system that rewards only those with deep pockets. After all, private markets remain the exclusive domain of accredited investors, leaving retail players to scramble for scraps on public exchanges. Meanwhile, data from market analytics firm Multpl shows the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio has sat above 19.6 since December 2018—well north of its long-term average of around 16.1—underscoring investors’ willingness to pay a premium for earnings these days. Low interest rates, robust corporate profits and an enduring tech optimism have driven valuations higher, yet they also set the stage for sudden corrections, as seen in the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis. On the flip side, BD argues blockchain could be the equalizer. He posed a provocative choice: do we lean into universal basic income to soften job losses from AI, or do we embrace “universal basic ownership,” whereby anyone with a smartphone can buy fractional stakes in everything from energy ventures to local cafés? By tokenizing real-world assets on Solana, users might soon scan a QR code to own a piece of their favorite coffee shop—or an energy grid—and participate directly in economic growth. In a nutshell, what starts as a quirky DeFi experiment could quickly become a profound shift toward inclusive ownership. Best Crypto To Buy Now The idea of universal tokenization on Solana shifts the investment landscape—suddenly, every asset class is within reach. As micro-ownership gains traction, certain tokens stand to benefit most. From memecoins with cult followings to BTC derivatives and native layer-one plays, here are the Best Cryptos To Buy Now. Mind of Pepe A tongue-in-cheek nod to meme culture, Mind Of Pepe is a project that blends humor and functionality. And when tokenization meets internet humor, this one could rally on sheer community momentum. Who would have thought? Merging the iconic Pepe the Frog meme with cutting-edge AI technology is shaking up the entire crypto world. The project has recently surpassed the $10 million mark in its presale—a remarkable milestone. Unlock real-time intelligence with Hive-Mind analysis. Purchasing MIND tokens during the presale gives users a first-mover advantage. This advanced intelligence enables users to access the latest trading signals, gain instant access to token purchasing pages, view in-depth market analysis, evaluate risk/reward ratios, and explore real-time chart displays. It’s a perfect glimpse into the future—power-packed with token deployment capabilities designed to identify market gaps and create crypto projects to fill them. With Bitcoin on the verge of retesting its all-time high, crypto YouTuber ClayBro predicts MIND could be one of the top-performing tokens. All metrics and signals are examined through a rigorous framework that pinpoints genuine alpha opportunities, effectively separating them from empty hype and market noise. BTC Bull Token Bridging Bitcoin’s legacy with DeFi’s innovation, BTC Bull offers leveraged exposure to the original crypto king. For those wanting a turbocharged BTC play, this derivative token packs a punch. It stands out in the crypto token presale sector with its novel two-pronged incentive scheme, offering investors an easy way to mirror Bitcoin’s success without requiring institutional-sized capital. First, it receives Bitcoin airdrops when Bitcoin hits key milestones, rising in $50K increments—such as at $150K, $200K, and $250K. Second, it destroys a certain portion of its token supply, which helps increase the potential value of BTC BULL tokens. On top of that, it is designed to reward long-term believers through a staking mechanism, where rewards are issued to users for the duration of the community sale. BTC Pizza Day hits different. 🍕📈 pic.twitter.com/ItX1JjOs3J — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 22, 2025 To support this level of generosity in rewards, the BTC Bull community required a wallet with advanced capabilities. As a result, it chose Best Wallet—a multichain crypto wallet that enables seamless Bitcoin airdrops directly into buyers’ multi chain wallets. Solaxy Solaxy embodies Solana’s ethos of seamless finance. As more projects launch native tokens, Solaxy’s staking rewards and governance perks position it as a must-watch for hands-on investors. One can observe an impressive surge in buying activity over the past two weeks, highlighting growing investor confidence as this presale nears its close. It’s safe to say that Solaxy is blasting through the crypto-verse. What triggered this upward momentum? A series of significant developments: easing US-China trade tensions, Bitcoin achieving its highest-ever weekly close, and Coinbase’s recent inclusion in the S&P 500. Solaxy is determined to redefine blockchain performance for Solana—the home of next-generation meme coins and the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency. As a Layer 2 blockchain, Solaxy addresses Solana’s key pain points, including network congestion, failed transactions, and scalability limitations. By merging Ethereum’s deep liquidity and ecosystem compatibility with Solana’s lightning-fast speeds, Solaxy delivers a dream solution for DeFi users and meme coin traders looking for a competitive edge. Bitcoin (BTC) The cornerstone of digital assets, Bitcoin remains the most liquid and battle-tested option. In a world shifting toward tokenized ownership, BTC’s store-of-value narrative only grows stronger. With Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $110K, it shows no signs of slowing down, leaving many analysts continuously predicting new record highs. One major contributing factor is the progress of a key crypto bill in the U.S. Senate—GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins). This bill has received bipartisan support and is expected to benefit those operating crypto businesses across the country. Recently, the crypto community celebrated Bitcoin Pizza Day, commemorating a historic milestone. On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz made the first documented purchase using Bitcoin, offering 10,000 BTC for two pizzas—marking a turning point in cryptocurrency history. In technical terms, it is currently trading at around $108,373 with a market cap of $2.15 trillion, positioning it in 1st place. However, over the past 24 hours, it has been declining, creating an opportunity for potential buyers to benefit from the dip. Little did he know, those 10,000 bitcoins would one day be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, the Bitcoin Pizza Index now stands at $1,115,411,643! Conclusion Akshay BD’s vision at Accelerate 2025 underscores a pivotal moment: blockchain is no longer a fringe tool but a gateway to mass participation in asset ownership. As tokenization on Solana scales, we’ll see increased institutional interest and a more level playing field for retail buyers. The rise of universal basic ownership reflects broader trends in financial democratization, from DeFi to real-world asset tokens. For investors eyeing strategic entry points, focusing on tokens that harness Solana’s capabilities, Bitcoin’s resilience, and community-driven dynamics will be key. After all, with tokenization rewriting the rules, these picks could be the best cryptos to buy now. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD. Bitcoin ( BTC ) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations.

Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 While the long-term picture looks promising, traders need to be careful in the near term. The failure to swiftly push the price back above $109,588 could attract profit-booking by short-term traders. If Bitcoin pulls back, several altcoins could also give up some of their recent gains. Could Bitcoin rise back above $109,588, pulling altcoins higher? If it does, let’s look at the cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin dropped back below the breakout level of $109,588 on May 23, and the bears thwarted attempts by the bulls to push the price back above the overhead resistance on May 24. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will again attempt to drive the price above the $109,588 to $111,980 overhead resistance zone. If they manage to do that, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the target objective of $130,000. The 20-day exponential moving average ($104,199) is the critical level to watch out for in the near term. If the support cracks, the pair could plummet to $100,000 and later to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,916). BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bears have pulled the price below the 50-SMA. The 20-EMA has started to turn down, and the relative strength index has dipped into negative territory, signaling that the bears have the upper hand. If the price sustains below the 50-SMA, the pair could descend to $102,500 and later to $100,000. Buyers will regain control if they push and maintain the price above the $109,588 resistance. The pair could then challenge the $111,980 level. A break above $111,980 could open the doors for a rally to $116,654. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid (HYPE) has broken above the $35.73 resistance, indicating that the bulls have kept up the pressure. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price sustains above $35.73, the HYPE/USDT pair could pick up momentum and surge to $42.25. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $42.25, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could skyrocket to $50. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below the breakout level of $35.73. If they do that, the pair could drop to the $32.15 support, where buyers are expected to step in. HYPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair bounced off the 20-EMA and cleared the overhead barrier at $35.73. If the price remains above $35.73, it suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. The pair could then attempt a rally to $42.25. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the 20-EMA. That could trap several aggressive bulls, pulling the pair to $32 and subsequently to $28.50. Monero price prediction Monero ( XMR ) soared above the $391 resistance on May 21, indicating that the bulls remain in control. XMR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The sharp rally of the past few days has kept the RSI in the overbought zone, suggesting that the bulls remain in command. If buyers maintain the price above $412, the XMR/USDT pair could resume its uptrend toward $456. Sellers will have to yank the price below the $375 level to weaken the bullish momentum. That could attract selling by short-term buyers, pulling the pair to the 20-day EMA ($347). A break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests a short-term trend change. XMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair is finding support at the 20-EMA, indicating that the bulls remain in control. If the price rises above $412, the uptrend could start the next leg of the uptrend to $456. Alternatively, a break and close below the 20-EMA suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could tug the price to the 50-SMA, which is likely to witness buying by the bulls. A bounce off the 50-SMA could face selling at the 20-EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a break below the 50-SMA increases. The pair could then tumble to $332. Related: What's the HYPE about?

Edit the caption here or remove the text The rising 20-day EMA ($231) and the RSI in the overbought zone show that the bulls have the edge. The AAVE/USDT pair could rally to the $285 level, which is expected to behave as a strong resistance. If buyers overcome the barrier at $285, the up move could extend to $300 and later to $350. Any pullback is expected to witness solid buying at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to pierce the overhead resistance. The bears will be back in the game on a break below the 20-day EMA. AAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has pulled back to the 20-EMA, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will try to propel the pair above $285. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $300. Conversely, if the price breaks below the 20-EMA, the pair could slide to the 50-SMA and later to $240. A bounce off $240 is expected to face selling at the 20-EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-EMA, it increases the risk of a drop to $217. Worldcoin price prediction Worldcoin’s (WLD) recovery is facing selling at $1.65, but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($1.20). WLD/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. If the price turns up from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to shove the price above the $1.65 resistance. If they can pull it off, the WLD/USDT pair could rally to $2.50. There is resistance at $1.89, but it is likely to be crossed. This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.99). WLD/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bears have pulled the price below the 20-EMA, indicating the start of a deeper correction toward the 50-SMA.

If the price turns down from the 20-EMA and breaks below the 50-SMA, the pair could plunge to $1.09. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the downtrend line.

In a post on the social media platform X, Scott Bessent says the White House is going all out on digital assets because the “anti-innovation agenda and regulation-by-enforcement approach” of the previous administration nearly destroyed the industry. “We are going big on digital assets. The Trump administration has made digital assets a priority. The past administration starved and almost made extinct a lot of these companies and pushed them offshore.” He says the government is particularly focused on stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to commodities and or fiat currencies such as the US dollar. “What we want to do is apply the highest US regulatory and AML (anti-money laundering) standard to digital assets, especially stablecoins.” Bessent also says stablecoins can ultimately drive strong demand for US debt. “I’ve seen estimates that just over the short term, stablecoins could create $2 trillion of demand for US Treasuries and Treasury bills. Put that in context, the number is probably about $300 billion right now… Digital asset companies deserve regulatory clarity – and that’s exactly what we are working toward.

2025-05-25T18:32:00.000Z,"SHIB whales are betting on MUTM as analysts call it the best crypto to buy","May 2025 marks the beginning of altcoin season, after Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high. Traditionally, a new all-time high for BTC is often marked by investors pouring into new and promising projects in the altcoin market. Thus far, one project that whales from Shiba Inu (SHIB) seem to be circling is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . On-chain data shows small transfers into MUTM, as the whales hope to quietly take advantage of this massive opportunity before the broader market can spot it. However, the market is already taking note of it, and they could soon go all in. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is currently in phase 5, having already raised over $9 million from nearly 11K supporters. The token is going for $0.03, with the price set to increase 16.67% to $0.035 in phase 6. With nearly 5% of the phase 5 tokens having been sold already, barely 24 hours after it started, this project could turn out to be the biggest gainer this month. As such, experts have described it as one of the best cryptos to buy in May 2025. Here is a deep dive on why experts are so optimistic. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) claims the DeFi throne Mutuum Finance is a project built on the foundation of innovation and long-term utility. It aims to transform decentralized finance into a worthy opponent for the mainstream financial sector. One of its most unique features in the lending protocol that combines peer to contract, and peer to peer lending capabilities. Within P2P, lenders will have an opportunity to participate in the low liquidity crypto market, where returns are also high. In contrast, P2C lenders will deposit their funds in a liquidity pool, where the annual percentage rate is dynamically set via smart contracts. For instance, a lender can deposit $15,000 worth of ETH in a pool and earn passive income from it for as long as they like. In return, they will receive mtTokens, which, in this case, are mtETH tokens. These mtTokens comply with the ERC20 token standard, and they can be freely exchanged on secondary marketplaces. Additionally, holders of mtTokens can also use them as collateral for loans within Mutuum Finance (MUTM). On redemption, holders will get their share contributed to the pool, plus any interest accrued during the staking period. The unique design of the mtTokens ensures that while users hold their assets in the lending pool, they can still unlock their value as they earn interest on them. The platform features a dynamic dashboard that allows users to track their contributions to the platform in real time. The project will also feature a real-time leaderboard, with the top contributors receiving a share of the platform’s revenue as MUTM tokens. This gamification process is expected to provide a massive boost to participation, which will further boost the value of the native tokens.The platform Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on innovations that will keep layer 2 fees to the minimum through cost optimizations. These efforts will ensure that even retail investors looking to make their name in the future of finance do not face the same obstacles that are imposed on them in the mainstream financial sector. A $100,000 reward for the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recognizes the power of community in building a powerful platform. To do this is it offering a $100K token reward program with plans to award 10 lucky winners with $10,000 each. The project has also launched a robust referral program, which is designed to build a powerful, and lasting community. Holders of MUTM tokens will also get access to numerous exclusive perks, and updates that are designed to ensure an active and thriving community. Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales are smart crypto investors who can tell a project is going to succeed based on specific parameters. Looking at the current presale number for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), and the massive social media following, it is not surprising they are quietly shifting their holdings into the MUTM token.

2025-05-25T18:30:00.000Z,"Ripple (XRP) to $10? Some Analysts Are Betting on This Cheap Crypto to Rise from $0.03 to $3 First","Ripple (XRP) has long been considered one of the best altcoins to invest in, especially with its ongoing push for global adoption through cross-border payments. With its current price hovering around $2.35, and bullish analysts predicting a surge to $10 during the 2025 crypto bull run, XRP could deliver solid long-term returns. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with strong fundamentals and low entry points is now catching investor attention. Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale offers tokens at a price of $0.03 per token. Acquisition by more than 11,500 presale buyers has produced a robust investor backing that has raised $9.2 million. Buyers of Mutuum Finance tokens during this phase get 100% profit at the projected $0.06 launch price. While XRP remains a top crypto to buy, this new contender could outperform it in 2025. Ripple (XRP) Eyes $5 as Regulatory Clarity Drives Momentum Ripple’s XRP trades at approximately $2.35 today, a healthy bounce and regained investor confidence. Standard Chartered analysts predict XRP to reach $5.50 by the year 2025 driven by Ripple’s strategic push into asset tokenization and the anticipated approval of an XRP spot ETF. The recent inclusion of XRP in the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, along with leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, reaffirms its growing institutional appeal. The launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and ongoing innovation in cross-border payments solutions further places XRP well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving digital asset landscape. While the journey to $5 is not straightforward, the intersection of technological advancements and favorable regulatory shifts renders XRP one of the tokens to keep an eye on in the crypto universe today. Emerging tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also gaining traction for their potential in decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance Presale The project has surpassed a significant milestone as its presale accumulates more than $9.2 million from participants who have exceeded 11,500 in number. Since presale initiation the MUTM token value has increased to $0.03 and will steadily grow up to launch at $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Lending System Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. This features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish direct loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P model, a superior way of managing assets. Users benefit from increased security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to an external audit by Certik and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings on exchanges will improve user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant set to receive $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. Ripple (XRP) continues to solidify its position as a leading altcoin, with analysts projecting a potential rise to $5.50–$10 fueled by regulatory clarity and the expansion of tokenization initiatives. However, the spotlight is now shifting toward Mutuum Finance, an emerging DeFi project that has already raised over $9.2 million from more than 11,500 participants in its Phase 5 presale. At just $0.03 per token, with a projected launch price of $0.06, early investors stand to gain 100% profit.

2025-05-25T18:30:00.000Z,"Kiyosaki warns savers: Break these ‘laws’ and you stay broke","Personal finance author Robert Kiyosaki is warning that many people remain poor because they fail to follow what he calls the “two most important laws of money.” In a recent statement, the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” argued that traditional savings in fiat currency like the U.S. dollar are becoming obsolete, urging individuals to store value in assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. He also emphasized the power of networks in creating wealth, comparing successful platforms like FedEx and Bitcoin to small-scale businesses and lesser-known cryptocurrencies. Kiyosaki’s message reiterates his long-standing belief that financial success hinges on smart investing and understanding the systemic forces that shape money and value. See below. ARE YOU BREAKING the LAWS? Most poor people are poor…. because they break the 2 most important laws of money. LAW #1: GRESHAM’s LAW: “When bad money enters a system….good money goes into hiding” In Rich Dad Poor Dad….I stated…. “ Savers are losers.” In 2025 poor people… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 24, 2025 Kiyosaki references Metcalf’s law The bestselling author also referenced Metcalf’s Law and focused on the power of networks in deciding investment value. He compared established franchise systems like McDonald’s to independent operations. Kiyosaki also noted that network-based businesses consistently outperform isolated competitors. “I invest in Bitcoin because it is a network. Most cryptos are not,” Kiyosaki stated. He also drew parallels between successful delivery networks like FedEx and individual operators without established distribution systems. The financial educator emphasized that his asset choices align with these economic principles. He also explained why he avoids holding U.S. dollars while accumulating gold, silver, and Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to Kiyosaki, these assets comply with both laws he considers essential for wealth preservation. Referencing advice from MicroStrategy executive Michael Saylor, Kiyosaki highlighted the importance of investing in assets that wealthy individuals would purchase. In a separate X post , Kiyosaki warned about what he perceives as deteriorating conditions in the U.S. bond market. He claimed that recent Federal Reserve bond auctions experienced insufficient demand and forced the central bank to purchase its own securities. “The Fed held an auction for US Bonds and no one showed up. So the Fed quietly bought $50 billion of its own fake money with fake money,” he stated. The author predicted major price increases for other assets. He projected gold could reach $25,000, silver might hit $70, and Bitcoin could surge between $500,000 and $1 million.

2025-05-25T17:30:27.000Z,"Bitcoin At Crossroads After Trump Tariff Shock: Breakdown Towards $106K Or New ATH?","Bitcoin is grappling with intensified volatility following a sharp selloff triggered by US President Donald Trump’s abrupt announcement of a sweeping 50% tariff on all EU imports starting June 1. The unexpected macroeconomic move sent shockwaves through assets, and Bitcoin was no exception, dropping aggressively from all-time highs near $111,800 to lows around $107,500 in a matter of hours. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Although there was a brief recovery towards $109,000, the ensuing price action now shows an intense battle between the bulls and bears, with technical analysis on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe showing the two ways Bitcoin can play out this week. Bitcoin Compression Structure Between Fair Value Gaps According to crypto analyst TehThomas, Bitcoin’s current price structure is defined by two opposing 1-hour fair value gaps (FVGs). The lower FVG zone identified by the analyst is around $107,500, which showed up during the rally towards $111,814 ATH and is now acting as the first significant reaction point post-rally. The upper FVG range is between $109,800 and $110,700. This level, previously the base of a breakdown candle, flipped into strong resistance on Friday. Interestingly, a rejection was confirmed inside this upper FVG, which showed there were many sellers present in that zone. Notably, the 1-hour chart shared by the analyst points to a deadlock scenario for the Bitcoin price. A breakout above or below the identified fair value gaps will likely define the directional bias for Bitcoin’s next major leg. Bitcoin’s next impulsive move will likely come with volume confirmation, either with a bullish displacement above resistance or a bearish rejection that pushes the Bitcoin price toward a lower demand target. Chart Image From TradingView Bullish And Bearish Scenarios For Bitcoin Interestingly, since the analysis, the ensuing price action has been marked by Bitcoin’s failure to reclaim the upper FVG and more of a consolidation around the lower FVG at $107,500. This places the most significance around this level, as Bitcoin’s reaction here could either cause a rebound upwards or a significant price retracement. For the bullish scenario, a bounce at the lower FVG will send the Bitcoin price towards the upper FVG. A sustained move above the upper FVG at $110,700 would indicate a bullish reclaim and might bring a new all-time high around $113,000 back into focus. Related Reading: Think Big? Multiply It By A Billion — XRP Tied To ‘Greatest’ Global Meeting: CEO For the bearish scenario, especially with a clean loss of the $107,500 level, the path opens for a move toward $106,000.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $107,017.

2025-05-25T17:28:49.000Z,"Metaplanet becomes top option for Japanese investors seeking Bitcoin exposure and tax advantage","Metaplanet’s board director, Shinpei Okuno, posted on his X account that the firm’s stock was the most bought security last week via NISA. Metaplanet recently partnered with SBI Holdings, a major player in Japan’s financial services industry and the parent company of SBI Securities. It is now seeing its stock surge to first place on the list of most purchased stocks in Japan. One of the factors driving the surge is the country’s high taxes on direct crypto holdings. Metaplanet becomes top pick for Japanese investors Metaplanet Inc., a Tokyo-listed investment company, became a top pick for Japanese investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and hoping to evade Japan’s high taxes on direct crypto holdings. In the latest rankings released by SBI Securities, which is Japan’s largest online brokerage, Metaplanet was first on the list of the most purchased stocks last week through the newly enhanced NISA tax-free investment accounts. The company’s rise to the top of the NISA purchase rankings was confirmed by both CEO and board directors, Simon Gerovich and Shinpei Okuno. Okuno posted on X, “I happened to be checking my timeline and noticed that MetaPlanet was ranked first in the NISA purchase rankings of SBI Securities customers last week.” Gerovich responded to his post, emphasizing the feature responsible for the company’s popularity. “Metaplanet was the #1 most bought stock last week via NISA accounts at SBI Securities, Japan’s largest online broker,” he said . “Japanese investors are using NISA, a tax-free investment scheme, to get exposure to Bitcoin without paying capital gains tax. Bitcoin + zero tax + leverage = Japan’s ultimate Bitcoin proxy.” In the same post, Okuno also acknowledged that the company has yet to appear in the rankings for balance of holdings, which is based on how much of investors’ portfolios are made up of Metaplanet stock. “On the other hand, our balance of holdings is not ranked,” Okuno said . “So we feel that we need to further strengthen our educational activities so that we can move up the rankings in terms of balance and have people consider Metaplanet as one of their long-term investment options!” Japan’s leading Bitcoin proxy Metaplanet initially operated in the hotel and hospitality space before the firm restructured in 2024 and officially announced its Bitcoin-first strategy. The company committed to regularly converting its cash holdings into Bitcoin to hedge against the economic instability in Japan, the chronic inflation, and the ballooning government debt. Since that restructuring, the firm has acquired over 1,700 BTC, worth roughly $171M, and has announced ambitious plans to raise capital and acquire even more. The company’s goal is to have acquired 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by 2026. The market responded enthusiastically to Metaplanet’s ambitious strategies and the company’s stock surged more than 3,600% in 2024. This surge in value made Metaplanet one of the best-performing equities on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Its total assets increased by 1,720%, while revenues climbed 306% year-over-year. The company’s appeal rose another notch when it introduced the now-overhauled NISA program in January 2024. The new Nippon Individual Savings Account (NISA) program allows individuals to invest in approved securities, which of course, includes Metaplanet, without paying capital gains tax. This is especially attractive for Japanese investors as Japan has taxes as high as 55% on direct Bitcoin holdings. As a result, Metaplanet has become the de facto “Bitcoin ETF” of Japan, despite the country not yet approving an official spot Bitcoin ETF like the U.S. did in early 2024.

2025-05-25T16:59:54.000Z,"Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Experts Reveal: Bitcoin Solaris Offers 10X Greater Wealth Potential at Just $4","The post Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Experts Reveal: Bitcoin Solaris Offers 10X Greater Wealth Potential at Just $4 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Ethereum continues its evolution through rollups and staking infrastructure, most 2025 price prediction models reflect a path of stable, moderate growth. Forecasts from leading analysts project a 2x to 3x gain from current levels, driven by institutional adoption, Layer-2 integrations, and increased on-chain activity. But with Ethereum now deeply embedded in the existing market structure, its asymmetric upside is largely behind it. That has led early-stage investors and crypto analysts to search for assets that mirror the early dynamics of Ethereum or Bitcoin. Bitcoin Solaris has emerged as one of the few candidates with a combination of fixed tokenomics, decentralized user rewards, and a performance-ready blockchain — all available at a fraction of Ethereum’s current market value. Protocol-Level Earnings Without Technical Complexity The foundation of Bitcoin Solaris lies in its mobile-native mining architecture. Through the upcoming Nova App, users will be able to mine BTC-S tokens directly from their smartphones by allocating 1–5 GB of storage and light background CPU. No validator setup or staking knowledge is required. Earnings are issued automatically based on device uptime. This structure lowers the barrier to entry and restores the participatory model that once defined Ethereum’s early days — where value was earned through protocol contribution, not price speculation. It opens the door for retail users to build wealth through network activity, not just capital exposure. Network Architecture Designed for High Speed Bitcoin Solaris leverages a dual-layer blockchain system to ensure scalability and decentralization. The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to secure the chain, while the Solaris Layer operates with Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) to manage smart contracts and real-time mining execution. The system supports 10,000+ transactions per second with 2-second finality. This throughput ensures seamless global reward distribution and application performance — without congestion, bottlenecks, or reliance on off-chain scaling solutions. The result is a protocol prepared for mass participation and mobile-driven mining at scale. Audit-Backed Infrastructure Provides Verifiability Bitcoin Solaris has completed comprehensive third-party verification. The Cyberscope audit confirmed the smart contract and token behavior, while the Freshcoins audit validated scalability under mobile mining conditions. The team has also passed full KYC verification , ensuring transparent governance and operational oversight. This level of infrastructure validation separates Bitcoin Solaris from speculative projects, grounding it in a secure framework where emission and participation rules are enforced at the protocol level. The Window Before Mass Adoption Remains Narrow Bitcoin Solaris is now in Presale Phase 4, with BTC-S priced at 4 USDT. Of the total fixed supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens, 4.2 million (20%) are allocated to the entire presale. There is no inflation mechanism or future minting, making this distribution final. Early participants are not only purchasing BTC-S at a discount but also securing mining priority before public rollout and rising competition. As more users join and difficulty increases, mining yields will tighten — making early positioning a defining factor for long-term returns. In a recent review, Crypto Nitro examined why Ethereum’s growth outlook, while strong, cannot match the early-stage potential of Bitcoin Solaris. He details how BTC-S’s fixed pricing, mobile mining, and launch-stage tokenomics create a path for outsized returns in 2025 — particularly for retail users seeking real protocol exposure. Ethereum will likely remain a core player in the blockchain ecosystem — but its wealth-generation phase has moved from exponential to linear. Bitcoin Solaris provides an alternative for those seeking early-phase upside through fixed supply, real user rewards, and decentralized access. Now in Presale Phase 4 at 4 USDT, BTC-S offers a defined window to enter a system designed for participation-based returns — before its performance, mining activation, and global visibility change the opportunity permanently.

The unnamed victim says that she received a text message that appeared as an alert from Bank of America telling her that $400 was charged to her account at a Walmart and that she had a pending wire transfer worth $9,400, reports the CBS-affiliate WFSB News. After replying, she received a phone call from someone she believed was a Bank of America employee. The victim says she was instructed to green light a wire transfer, promising her that the funds would be returned to her account. Matt Antonetti, the victim’s father, says he abruptly called BofA after hearing that her daughter transferred the funds, hoping that the transaction could still be stopped. But his efforts did not pay off, as his daughter’s account was wiped out to the tune of $5,050 the next day. Antonetti says he spoke with BofA multiple times to recover his daughter’s funds. “Yes, our daughter fell victim to a scam, but we immediately notified our bank, who we entrust with our money to do the right thing.” But BofA denied Antonetti’s claim, saying that the bank “does not offer compensation in matters such as this.” When WFSB News tried to intervene on behalf of the Antonettis, a BofA representative said, “Consistent with federal law, we reimburse clients when a transaction is not authorized by the account holder. In cases like this, we attempt to recover the money from the bank that received the wire, but there is no guarantee once the client has authorized the payment.

2025-05-25T16:53:21.000Z,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $1.00 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $3.29. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $10.31 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7396 Market Cap $26.13 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $599.94 Million Circulating Supply 35.32 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7618 24-hour Low $0.7299 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.24% 50-day SMA $ 0.702805 14-Day RSI 50.18 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart on May 25, Cardano (ADA) is currently consolidating around the $0.75 mark, showing signs of cautious bullish sentiment. The price is positioned between the mid and upper Bollinger Bands, indicating mild upward pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 56.03 suggests the asset is in neutral territory, with no immediate signs of overbought or oversold conditions. This offers room for potential upside if bullish momentum strengthens. However, resistance around $0.85 remains a hurdle. Sustained movement above the $0.77-$0.78 range could confirm a bullish continuation, while failure to hold above the 20-day SMA could invite short-term corrective moves. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA), the price appears to be in a consolidative phase just below the upper Bollinger Band, indicating mild bullish momentum. The MACD is slightly negative, suggesting a neutral to weak trend with potential for reversal if momentum strengthens. The Balance of Power shows intermittent buyer strength, but without sustained dominance. ADA is trading above the middle Bollinger Band, a sign of potential upward continuation if volume increases. However, failure to breach the upper band could trigger a short-term retracement. Traders should monitor for MACD crossover or price breaking key support around $0.716 for clearer direction. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $0.697264 BUY SMA 5 $0.748025 SELL SMA 10 $0.778029 SELL SMA 21 $0.748071 SELL SMA 50 $0.691982 BUY SMA 100 $0.724535 BUY SMA 200 $0.678281 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $0.725761 BUY EMA 5 $0.699848 BUY EMA 10 $0.677602 BUY EMA 21 $0.682186 BUY EMA 50 $0.722112 BUY EMA 100 $0.756738 SELL EMA 200 $0.725851 BUY What to expect from Cardano price analysis next Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts of Cardano (ADA), the asset displays short-term consolidation with a cautious bullish bias. On the 4-hour chart, ADA is holding above the middle Bollinger Band, showing resilience, though the MACD remains slightly bearish and momentum is soft. The Balance of Power is neutral, suggesting indecision among traders. On the 1-day chart, ADA trades near the lower boundary of a recent upward channel, with the RSI at 50.86 reflecting balanced pressure. Overall, ADA may oscillate between $0.72 and $0.85 in the near term, with a breakout above resistance likely requiring stronger volume and macro support. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $1.00, with an average trading price of about $0.88 and a minimum price of $0.85. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $7.10. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.92 and $7.10, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to surpass $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $7.10. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $10 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $10.31. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.68, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $7.10. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano The Cardano Builder Fest #2 is scheduled for April 2025 in Vietnam. Developer Andrew Westberg has proposed reducing the treasury tax from 20% to 10%, which has been the subject of much discussion. Some argue that this would boost staking incentives and short-term price growth, while others worry about its impact on Cardano’s long-term sustainability. Cardano price prediction May 2025 By May 2025, Cardano is projected to have a minimum price of $0.6638, with forecasts showing a maximum price of $0.7468 and an average price of $0.7260.

By 2026, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $1.264 Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. In January 2025, Cardano traded around $1.02 and $1.09. However, the closing price for Cardano in January was $0.9. In February 2025, ADA surged toward $0.81 but it declined toward $0.64 by the end of the month. ADA value dropped further in March as it dipped to the $0.60 range. In April, ADA price dropped below $0.55 but it later surged toward $0.7. ADA ended April at $0.7030. At the start of May, ADA price skyrocketed to $0.8.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-price-prediction/,"ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|FORKS","Crypto Price Predictions|ADA",cryptocompare
2025-05-25T16:32:00.000Z,"Is this the best DeFi coin under $1 to buy right now?","As the crypto market explodes in value, one of the worst mistakes inexperienced investors make is to try to buy in at the top of the market. For instance, with Bitcoin (BTC) at over $110K, it is unrealistic to attempt to purchase it right now, as you could realistically only make very small gains in the coming weeks. However, there are still amazing opportunities for crypto investors right now. One of these is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently going for $0.03 per token. A proven strategy in crypto investment strategies is to find projects that have promising utility and get into them before their value inevitably explodes on the open market. None has demonstrated this concept so far better than Mutuum Finance (MUTM). At the enviable price of just $0.03, which guarantees a 100% return at the listing price of $0.06, it almost feels like you are getting the tokens for free. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is only in phase 5, with six more phases to go. Thus far, it has seen nearly 11K unique supporters join the project, contributing nearly $10 million to date. At this rate, the presale could be over sooner than previously expected. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price is set to rise to $0.035, marking a 16.67% increase, which means now is the best time to get your tokens. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utility In 2025, utility is king, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is pushing the boundaries of what is possible with DeFi technology. They are not simply looking to be one of the players in the DeFi sector; they are looking to be the main player in the DeFi sector. To achieve this, they plan to launch a unique lending protocol where users can deposit funds, and in exchange, they will receive an annual percentage yield based on the utilization of the pool. For instance, users will be able to deposit $20,000 worth of ETH, and in exchange get mtETH tokens. These tokens are part of a unique mtToken feature created by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that aims to allow users of the platform to unlock the full utility of their tokens while still earning interest on them. When a user deposits their mtTokens back to the pool, they will receive their principal amount back, plus the interest those tokens have accrued during the time. Additionally, they will benefit from the time-value appreciation of their assets while they are in the pool. Not only that, but they will also benefit from dividend distributions made by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The dividend comes from the platform’s revenue, which is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market and distribute them to stakers on the platform. It is designed to ensure that the biggest stakers get bonus rewards for helping to maintain a healthy ecosystem. To demonstrate these capabilities, the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. This will serve as an important means of testing the features, to ensure that when the live platform is launched, users get the full benefits from day one. The launch will also be a key demonstration of how committed the developer team is to transforming the DeFi industry with new lending capabilities. They will also use the beta platform as a way to gain feedback on some of the design aspects of the project, ensuring that when it goes live, everyone will be pleased to use it. To ensure that platform users keep as much of their profits as possible, the team plans to implement cost optimization on layer 2 (L2). To do this, they will focus on calldata, which is the main cause of high platform fees. They will do this by compressing all data into a single byte-encoded string, helping to cut back on the on-chain storage and transaction costs. The result will be fast, cost-effective user experiences on L2, which aligns with the project’s goal of delivering scalability at low cost. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) massive rewards To reward its supporters who have helped the project raise over $9 million, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a $100K giveaway. The campaign will select 10 participants, each receiving $10K. To qualify, users need to invest a minimum of $50 in MUTM during the presale. Every presale buyer is encouraged to take part in this reward program, as it adds extra value to what many experts see as one of the most promising projects in the DeFi space.

2025-05-25T16:30:11.000Z,"Bitcoin Nears End Of Post-Halving Consolidation Phase – Cycle Peak In Sight?","It’s been just over a year since the latest Bitcoin halving, and the price is now hovering near all-time highs after reaching $112,000 earlier this week. BTC is holding strong at current levels, consolidating just below peak resistance, and momentum is quietly building. Many traders and analysts believe a massive breakout could be on the horizon in the coming weeks. According to insights from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), this cycle is unfolding with some familiar patterns—and a few notable differences. Historically, Bitcoin tends to spend the first year after a halving in a prolonged consolidation phase before entering its strongest rally. However, this time around, BTC spiked earlier than expected but then paused for several months as high interest rates and tighter macro conditions weighed on risk appetite. Despite the delayed continuation, current price action suggests Bitcoin may be ready to break that consolidation range and enter the next leg of the cycle. With BTC firmly above $100K and institutional demand rising , the stage may be set. While macro risks remain, sentiment has shifted. Bitcoin isn’t just surviving the post-halving year—it may be setting up for its most powerful breakout yet. Bitcoin Sets The Stage For Uptrend Continuation Despite Uncertainty Bitcoin is holding steady near its all-time highs, and the market is beginning to show signs of renewed bullish momentum. As uncertainty grows in global markets, Bitcoin appears to be positioning itself for a continuation of its uptrend. Analysts with high conviction are now calling for major price surges, citing both technical strength and improving on-chain signals. According to insights from Sentora , Bitcoin’s current behavior aligns closely with historic cycle patterns. In past cycles, BTC typically spends the first post-halving year consolidating before entering a decisive breakout phase. While this cycle defied expectations by spiking early, momentum quickly slowed as high interest rates and tighter financial conditions weighed on investor sentiment. Still, the broader pattern remains intact. Sentora notes that in most cycles, Bitcoin peaks tend to emerge 1.5 to 2 years after the halving—a timeline that shifts the spotlight to 2025. This suggests that current consolidation, while frustrating to some, could be part of a healthy and structured market setup before the next explosive move. With price action stabilizing above $100K and key on-chain metrics remaining strong, the long-term outlook remains bullish. If BTC can maintain current support and break through resistance in the coming weeks, the groundwork for a much larger rally could soon be in place. For now, the market is watching closely—but conviction among seasoned analysts is building. Bitcoin may be entering the quiet before the storm. BTC Flirts With Highest Weekly Close Ever Bitcoin is closing the week near $108,000 after reaching a new all-time high, marking what could become the strongest weekly close in its history. The weekly chart shows clear breakout strength above the previous resistance zone around $103,600, now flipped into support. This level had capped price action for months, but the latest surge confirms bulls are firmly in control. BTC has posted four consecutive green weekly candles, with increasing body size and strong closes, indicative of a sustained trend. The 34-week EMA sits at $87,966, far below current levels, underscoring the strength of this move and how extended BTC is from mid-range averages. Importantly, volume has remained relatively stable during the breakout, showing that the move is being supported, not exhausted. As long as Bitcoin remains above the $103,600–$105,000 zone, the uptrend is intact. If the price consolidates around current levels without significant sell pressure, it could form the base for a push toward $120,000 and beyond. However, failure to hold $103K could invite deeper retracements.

2025-05-25T16:16:36.000Z,"Ex-IMF Chief Says Crypto Is Weakening US Dollar Power","Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff believes cryptocurrency is slowly weakening the global influence of the US dollar. In a recent interview, he said digital currencies are gaining ground in underground markets where the dollar once dominated. Rogoff warned that this shift could impact the U.S. economy and global financial power. The US Dollar Is Losing Strength While Crypto Gains Ground Kenneth Rogoff has held key roles in the global finance sector. He previously served as the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a Federal Reserve board member. Based on his years of experience, he believes the US dollar is no longer as dominant as it used to be. Rogoff said that other major currencies, such as China’s renminbi and the European euro, have been gaining more power in the global financial system for years. He noted that crypto is now speeding up this shift, with Bitcoin now considered a safe haven. This is especially true during market uncertainty and macroeconomic pressures. The former IMF chief says the dollar’s decline is partly due to crypto use in the underground economy. This includes unreported and illegal activities like tax evasion and unregistered deals. He noted that many in this $20–25 trillion market once used cash, but now prefer cryptocurrency. Rogoff Says Cryptocurrencies Threaten U.S. Financial Power Rogoff warned that the dollar’s loss of ground in the gray market could have real-world consequences. If the dollar becomes less important globally, interest rates in the U.S. could rise. This would make loans, mortgages, and Treasury bonds more expensive. The United States has long benefited from having the world’s top reserve currency. This unique position allows the U.S. to borrow money at lower interest rates. Rogoff emphasized that if that position weakens, everything will be more expensive for Americans. There is also a national security risk concern. The U.S. government tracks global financial flows to spot threats and enforce sanctions. However, when crypto is used in these transactions, it becomes harder for the government to trace the money and respond to potential dangers. Rogoff Agrees Crypto Has Real Value While many critics argue that cryptocurrencies are worthless or only useful for illegal activity , Kenneth Rogoff strongly disagrees with this view. He said that digital assets do have real value and act as a medium of exchange. Even if governments introduce stricter rules for crypto, it will likely continue to grow in the underground economy. He clarified that crypto cannot replace the dollar in the legal economy , where government oversight is strong. Nevertheless, crypto is already becoming a popular choice in the underground economy, where rules are often ignored or avoided.

The company's most recent purchase of 7,390 BTC on May 19, valued at nearly $765 million, brought Strategy's total holdings to 576,230 BTC. If Strategy completes the acquisition on May 26, it will mark the company's seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases. Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases over time and major metrics. Source: SaylorTracker Strategy has become synonymous with Bitcoin, as the company continues stacking large amounts of BTC for its corporate treasury and inspiring other companies to pivot to a Bitcoin treasury plan, creating a sustained demand for the digital asset from institutional players and helping bolster the price of BTC. Related: Jim Chanos takes opposing bets on Bitcoin and Strategy BTC to propel Strategy into a $10 trillion enterprise, leaving other companies in the dust? Market analyst Jeff Walton recently said that Strategy may become a $10 trillion company and potentially command the title of the most valuable publicly traded corporation in the world due to its growing Bitcoin stockpile. “Strategy holds more of the best assets, and the most pristine collateral, on the entire planet than any other company, by multiples,” Walton told the Financial Times in a documentary about the company. The analyst added that most companies typically face challenges raising hundreds of millions of dollars in capital, but Strategy has been able to raise billions of dollars in under two months. Whereas most companies would spend this capital to overhaul the production process or on operational costs, Strategy uses the depreciating fiat money raised from creditors and equity holders to purchase a rapidly appreciating asset for its balance sheet. Michael Saylor previously forecasted that the price of Bitcoin would reach millions of dollars per coin in the coming decades, arguing that the supply-capped asset features an asymmetric upside against all fiat currencies that have no supply cap. However, Bitcoin has struggled to reach the $150,000 level in the short term. Saylor blamed the sluggish price action on investors taking profits prematurely and rotating out of BTC due to a lack of long-term conviction.

2025-05-25T16:11:59.000Z,"Dogecoin price chart points to a 285% surge to $0.8630","Dogecoin price remains in a tight range, 53% below its highest point in November, but a forming cup and handle pattern points to an eventual surge to $0.8630 and beyond. Dogecoin ( DOGE ) token was trading at $0.2200 on Sunday, 68% above its lowest level in November. It is still the biggest meme coin in crypto, with over $32 billion in market capitalization. Dogecoin price technical analysis points to a rebound The weekly chart shows that the DOGE price peaked at $0.7390 in 2021 when Elon Musk was pumping it. It then plunged and bottomed at $0.048 in June 2022. The coin has slowly formed a cup-and-handle pattern whose upper side is at $0.4522, its highest point in November last year and May 2021. A C&H pattern has two parts. The cup section has a rounded bottom and horizontal support. The handle section has either a pullback or some consolidation. You might also like: BNB flashes a golden cross as DEX volume soars ahead of Maxwell upgrade In Dogecoin’s case, the handle part has been a pullback from a high of $0.4522 in November to $0.1295. A bullish breakout will happen when the DOGE price rises above the upper side of the cup at $0.4522. The profit target in a Cup and Handle pattern is determined by measuring the depth of the cup and projecting that same distance upward from the cup’s upper rim. In this case, the cup has a depth of 92%, giving the target price at $0.8630, up by 295% from the current level.

DOGE whale accumulation | Source: Santiment The other potential catalyst will be the approval of the four DOGE ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2025-05-25T16:01:25.000Z,"XRP Plunges Below $2.30 Amid Heavy Selling Pressure","Global economic tensions are weighing heavily on cryptocurrency markets as XRP experiences a significant correction amid heavy selling pressure. The recent announcement of potential 50% tariffs on European Union imports by the US government has triggered widespread market uncertainty, with XRP falling alongside most major cryptocurrencies despite Bitcoin recently reaching new all-time highs. Technical analysts point to critical support at the $2.25-$2.26 range, with market watchers warning that a break below this level could trigger deeper corrections toward the $1.55-$1.90 zone. Meanwhile, institutional interest remains strong with Volatility Shares launching an XRP futures ETF and leveraged ETF inflows surging despite the price dip, suggesting Wall Street continues accumulating positions during market weakness. Technical Analysis Highlights XRP underwent a notable 3.46% correction over the 24-hour period, with price declining from $2.361 to $2.303, creating an overall range of $0.084 (3.57%). The most significant price action occurred during the midnight hour (00:00), when XRP plummeted to $2.297 on exceptionally high volume (37.1M), establishing a strong volume-based support zone. A secondary sell-off at 08:00 saw price touch the period low of $2.280 with the highest volume spike (39.9M), confirming a double-bottom formation. In the last hour, XRP experienced significant volatility with a recovery attempt following the earlier correction. After reaching a low of $2.297 at 13:11, price formed a base around $2.298 before staging a substantial rally beginning at 13:27, peaking at $2.307 at 13:36-13:39 with exceptionally high volume (627K-480K). This bullish momentum created a clear resistance zone at $2.307, which was tested multiple times. The final 15 minutes saw profit-taking pressure emerge, with price retracing to $2.300, establishing a short-term support level that aligns with the psychological $2.30 threshold.

2025-05-25T16:00:22.000Z,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Distributing Again — Local Price Top Imminent?","After an impressive outing in the past week, the price of Bitcoin seems to be in a cool-off period, sitting nearly 4% away from its recent all-time high. This weekend’s performance somewhat looks like the typical movement of the crypto market at the end of the week in 2025. However, the latest on-chain observation shows that a group of investors might be responsible for the sluggishness of the Bitcoin price over the past day. These recent signs point to the possibility of the bull cycle entering its final stages. Here’s When BTC Price Could Begin To Witness Significant Correction In a new post on the social media platform X, investment data firm Alphractal revealed that the Bitcoin short-term holders (STH) are starting to distribute their coins. The short-term holders are known to be the most reactive group of investors, as seen with the BTC investors shaving off their holdings following the recent increase in the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back To Daily EMA 8 – Can Bulls Hold Momentum? This on-chain revelation is based on the changes in the Bitcoin Supply Held By Short-Term Holders indicator, which tracks the total amount of BTC owned by investors for less than 155 days. As shown in the chart below, this metric has been dwindling over the past few weeks, signaling ongoing distribution by short-term investors. From a historical perspective, when the supply held by STH witnesses an abrupt decline, the price of Bitcoin is likely near major cycle tops. In essence, the reactive investors offload their assets as the price increases, slowing down the coin’s demand. Alphractal noted that this is “a classic sign” that the bull cycle might be close to its final stages. The on-chain analytics firm also highlighted that the Short-Term Holder realized price currently sits at $94,500, acting as the final support level preventing this investor group from going underwater. On the other hand, the Long-Term Holder realized price currently stands at around $33,000, suggesting a clear behavioral divergence between long-term and short-term investors. In the end, Alpractal noted that the Bitcoin price still managed to reach new all-time highs in 2021 despite the STH distribution. Hence, the market intelligence platform believes that the BTC price still has room for some upside movement, even though macro on-chain signals and the halving cycle pattern suggest a significant correction could begin after October 2025. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just beneath $109,000, reflecting a 0.4% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by over 5% in the last seven days.

2025-05-25T16:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin to $200k or Mutuum Finance to $2 First? Analysts Debate the Best Crypto to Buy Now as BTC Hits New ATH","Bitcoin (BTC) has shattered expectations by reaching a fresh all-time high, reigniting bullish sentiment across the crypto market. With institutional adoption surging and Bitcoin ETFs gaining momentum, top analysts now forecast BTC climbing to $200,000 during the peak of the 2025 bull run. The surge is driven not only by macroeconomic factors but also by increasing scarcity post-halving. However, some experts argue that while BTC remains the dominant force, its upside may be limited compared to newer, undervalued projects. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has successfully completed Phase 4 of its presale, raising a cumulative total of $9.2 million from over 11,500 token purchasers. The structured presale model has currently set the token price at $0.03 in phase 5, accelerating progress toward a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM, a 16.67% rise. With a 200% gain already achieved since its initial launch, MUTM is set to officially launch at $0.06, offering current buyers a guaranteed 100% return on investment (2x ROI). Bitcoin’s Ascent: Eyeing $150K Amid Institutional Momentum and Regulatory Tailwinds Bitcoin (BTC) recently reached a new all-time high, sitting at some $110,887, on the back of a confluence of positive developments. The rally is a result of increased institutional adoption, with the likes of MicroStrategy increasing their positions, and the U.S. government’s realization of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, reflecting intense federal support. Analysts predict that if current trends hold, Bitcoin can hit $150,000 by the end of 2025, driven by sustained institutional interest and positive regulatory environment. As bright as Bitcoin’s outlook is, newer cryptos like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also attracting attention for their potential in delivering substantial returns. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s climb toward $200,000 continues to fuel optimism, but some analysts believe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could hit $2 first—offering a faster path to major gains. With over $9.2 million raised from 11,500+ buyers, and a current presale price of $0.03 set to double at launch, MUTM is gaining serious momentum. Backed by a hybrid lending model, deflationary tokenomics, and a fully collateralized stablecoin in development, MUTM stands out as a high-upside alternative to BTC. For investors seeking speed and scale in returns, this DeFi newcomer may outpace even Bitcoin’s record-setting rally.

2025-05-25T15:54:20.000Z,"Bitcoin Rainbow chart predicts BTC price for June 1, 2025","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) Rainbow Chart has issued fresh insights into how the asset will likely start June, just days after clinching a record high. Notably, this comes as Bitcoin’s bullish run has hit a bump. The asset lost the $110,000 support after briefly soaring above an all-time high of above $111,000 mid-week, a surge driven largely by institutional capital inflows. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $107,498, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours but up nearly the same value over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Amid the current momentum, Bitcoin is approaching overbought territory as the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) reads 63. However, the short- and long-term outlooks remain bullish, with the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ) sitting lower at $94,730 and $86,569, respectively. Bitcoin price prediction for June 1 The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, using a logarithmic growth curve to illustrate investor sentiment across price levels, offers a glimpse into what might lie ahead for June 1. Its nine color-coded zones span from “Bitcoin is dead” (severe bearishness) to “Maximum Bubble Territory” (extreme overvaluation). According to the chart, Bitcoin is projected to trade between approximately $32,787 and $372,813 on June 1, with each band representing a distinct level of sentiment. Bitcoin Rainbow chart. Source: BlockhainCenter At the lower end, prices below $43,000 suggest a “Basically a Fire Sale,” signaling that Bitcoin could be severely undervalued. The $43,000 to $58,000 range, the chart indicates a “BUY!” zone, encouraging accumulation. Moving higher, the $58,000 to $75,000 band reflects the “Accumulate” zone, suggesting cautious optimism. Between $75,000 and $97,800, the sentiment shifts to “Still cheap,” indicating that Bitcoin remains reasonably priced for long-term holders. Next, the $97,800 to $128,600 range enters the“HODL!” phase, a call to resist the urge to sell. Given the current price, this level is the most likely scenario for June 1. Beyond that, prices between $128,600 and $164,400 raise the question, “Is this a bubble?” hinting at potential overheating. Bitcoin’s extreme bullish zone If Bitcoin climbs into the $164,400 to $211,400 range, the market may experience intensified FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). A further surge into the $211,400 to $276,300 band would call for serious caution with a “Sell. Seriously, SELL!” label. Finally, prices between $276,300 and $372,800 would place Bitcoin in the “Maximum Bubble Territory,” indicating extreme overvaluation. Although the Rainbow Chart provides an insightful visualization of Bitcoin’s historical price behavior, it’s not a precise predictive tool. It extrapolates long-term trends based on logarithmic growth, but unpredictable factors like macroeconomic events, regulations, and technological changes can impact future prices. Still, it is a valuable guide for investors and traders gauging Bitcoin’s potential trajectory.

2025-05-25T15:40:39.000Z,"Bitcoin Drops Below $107.5K as Trump Tariff Threat Triggers Crypto Sell-Off","Bitcoin's recent pullback has established strong volume-based resistance near $108,300, with support forming in the $106,700-$107,000 zone. The correction accelerated with a notable price surge from $107,373 to $107,671 between 13:06-13:36, followed by a sharp reversal. Technical analysis suggests Bitcoin is now trading within a compression zone, trapped between two major fair value gaps that will determine the upcoming market direction. If bulls reclaim the $109K to $110K area, price could push toward resistance beyond $112K, while a break below $107,000 might test liquidity around $106K. Technical Analysis Breakdown The decline accelerated during the 22:00-23:00 hour on May 24th with exceptionally high volume (16,335 BTC), establishing a strong volume-based resistance near $108,300. Support has formed in the $106,700-$107,000 zone where buyers emerged during the 09:00-10:00 period on May 25th, though recovery attempts have been modest with price consolidating around $107,500. The overall technical structure suggests a short-term bearish trend with potential for further consolidation before directional clarity emerges. Bitcoin experienced significant volatility with a notable price surge from $107,373 to $107,671 between 13:06-13:36, followed by a sharp reversal that saw prices decline to $107,393 by 14:00. The most substantial price movement occurred during the 13:35 minute candle where BTC jumped nearly $150 with exceptionally high volume (148.76 BTC), establishing temporary resistance around $107,630. Support formed near $107,400 where buyers emerged during the final minutes of the period, though the overall technical structure suggests continued consolidation within the broader correction from the $109,239 high.

2025-05-25T15:13:32.000Z,"Surprise XRP Price Prediction: This Ripple Rival Is Tipped To Lead Altcoin Season Instead","XRP has long been seen as crypto’s remittance king, a sleek solution to cross-border payments, backed by Ripple’s bold vision to take on the banks. And with regulatory hurdles finally fading, many expected XRP to lead the charge into the next altcoin season. But that may no longer be the case. Enter Remittix (RTX) , a rising PayFi protocol priced under $0.10 and already drawing whispers from analysts who believe it, not XRP, could ignite the next altcoin rally. While XRP leans on legacy and legal victories, Remittix is building in real time: seamless crypto-to-fiat transfers, bank payouts without middlemen and a presale haul north of $15 million. It’s not just another token, it’s everything XRP promised to be, rebuilt on Ethereum with none of the baggage. And in a market where speed and utility are king, this dark horse might just run ahead of the pack. XRP stalls while Bitcoin soars and a new rival gains ground Just as Bitcoin soared to $111,807 on the back of $934M in daily ETF inflows, XRP moved in the opposite direction. While the broader market rallied, XRP slipped from $2.44 to $2.31 in a day, weighed down by macroeconomic pressures and sector-specific challenges. Source: Coingecko Geopolitical tensions added fuel to market uncertainty. Trump’s threat of a 50% EU import tariff shook global markets, boosting Bitcoin, but not XRP. While institutions piled into BTC, XRP saw little love. In the XRP price prediction space, this gap has sparked new concerns about Ripple’s resilience. Compounding the issue was JPMorgan’s announcement of a “Wall Street stablecoin” initiative in collaboration with three major U.S. banks. The project spooked investors and sent ripples through Ripple’s $300 million RLUSD market. Combined with the closure of several short positions, these moves magnified volatility and sparked concerns over XRP’s ability to hold ground in an increasingly crowded PayFi arena. Despite its struggles, XRP is far from down and out. The token remains one of crypto’s most recognized assets and its utility in global remittances still holds weight. But as competition heats up, from banks, blockchains and next-gen players like Remittix, XRP’s future will depend not just on the tide of Bitcoin’s rise, but on how it adapts to a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Investors eyeing their next move are watching closely. Remittix is racing ahead while Ripple watches from the sidelines While XRP fights headwinds, a rising star is quietly stealing the spotlight. Remittix, a PayFiupstart built on Ethereum, is redefining how money moves across borders. No intermediaries. No correspondent banks. Just clean, instant transactions, with transparent fees that leave both banks and traditional platforms in the dust. Source: YouTube The buzz is real. With over 536 million RTX tokens sold and $15.3 million raised in its presale at just $0.0781 per token, Remittix is closing in on 20,000 token holders. Momentum is accelerating as users flock to a platform that actually delivers on crypto’s original promise: faster, cheaper, and borderless finance. Behind the scenes, it’s more than hype. A powerhouse team of developers, blockchain engineers, fintech veterans, and compliance experts has quietly been assembled. Remittix has already locked in key licensing frameworks, ensuring that fiat payout corridors meet full KYC/AML compliance in every target region. That’s no small feat in a regulatory minefield. And now, the first look at the Remittix Wallet is out. Sleek, intuitive and built for real-world use, it’s a non-custodial wallet that holds $RTX and other tokens while linking seamlessly to fiat rails. If XRP is still asking how to bridge crypto and cash, Remittix may have already answered. Conclusion XRP’s legacy still holds weight, but in today’s fast-moving market, legacy isn’t enough. While Ripple watches from the sidelines, Remittix is executing in real time. With utility, speed and a $15.3M presale to back it, this Ethereum-based upstart might just rewrite the XRP price prediction playbook entirely.

Speaking at the Solana Accelerate event in New York, Wood highlighted that while crypto wallets offer added protection and independence, the ease and convenience of ETFs will keep them popular among traditional investors . She commented: I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button. – Cathie Wood Cathie Wood says wallets act as insurance policies for investors Wood argued that ETFs will remain attractive to those using them for convenience, though these crypto products may ultimately act as a bridge to wallet-based solutions. She added that investors are still drawn to the offer of decentralization wallets, saying they are “insurance policies” against failures in traditional financial systems . So far, there are roughly 200 million active Bitcoin wallets globally, per Bitbo’s data. Meanwhile, U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw around $2.75 billion in inflows during the trading week ending May 23, as Bitcoin surged to a record high of $111,970 on May 22. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have received over $44 billion in inflows, while spot Ether ETFs have only recorded $2.77 billion since launch. Wood explained that Ether ETFs saw less success because the US Securities and Exchanges Commission did not permit staking . Nonetheless, she believes Ether could be the gateway for new investors to understand smart contracts before moving on to assets like Solana. Eric Balchunas, interviewing Wood, also claimed that several investors are hoping for a Solana ETF more than Ether or XRP ETFs. Wood, however, claimed that President Trump’s decision to introduce his memecoin, TRUMP, on the Solana network may have altered some investors’ perception of the SOL token and network, making them more cautious and skeptical. Nonetheless, she said she would share her Solana price projection once she’s done with her analysis. VanEck criticizes the SEC for delaying its decision on ETF filings without proper communication VanEck recently aimed at the SEC for what it termed as delays on several Bitcoin ETF-related applications. The firm’s head of research, Matthew Sigel, argued that the commission’s postponements affect its options trading application tied to its spot Bitcoin ETF. The investment management company criticized the company for poor communication and unclear reasoning behind the delays. Sigel cited the delay of CBOE’s 19b-4 filing on the HODL options listing, claiming the regulatory agency postponed its decision without a proper explanation. While the commission put off its approval for several filings, it is still accepting new submissions. The SEC also delayed its decision on the firm’s in-kind creation and redemption for its spot Bitcoin ETF. Similarly, Fidelity’s filing on in-kind redemptions on its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs was postponed, and no decision timeline was provided. Additionally, on May 22, the agency put off its ruling on CoinShares spot XRP ETF application. However, it did provide a timeline, pushing its deadline from May 26 to August 24. The agency also asked for public input on the firm’s filing, which added more uncertainty. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-05-25T14:46:22.000Z,"Comparing Dogecoin (DOGE) and 'XRP 2.0' Remittix (RTX) Chances Of Hitting $10 In Future","In this article, meme king Dogecoin (DOGE) goes head to head against Remittix (RTX), a rapidly rising PayFi protocol dubbed XRP 2.0. Dogecoin is on a bullish trend after recovering from the slump of the last few months. Remittix , on the other hand, has appreciated by a whopping 420% in 2025 and doesn't seem to be slowing down. Which of these tokens has a better chance of hitting $10 in the future? Let's find out. Remittix: An ambitious PayFi solution that is heading to the top Cross-border transactions have been a global financial headache for many years. These payments are known to be expensive, slow, and at times, downright frustrating. The global remittances industry is worth over $800 billion but is still plagued by these issues. But the arrival of Remittixis set to put an end to these problems. This is because Remittix leverages the power of blockchain technology to provide faster, cheaper, and more efficient cross-border transactions. It connects over 30 blockchains with payment networks worldwide to allow its users to send crypto, right from their wallets, to any bank account in fiat. Such groundbreaking solutions are rare these days, and that is why Remittix has quickly gained traction. Even though it is still in presale, it has already earned the term \""XRP 2.0,\"" and investors are jumping onto its bandwagon in droves. With a potential big enough to disrupt global remittances, Remittix's current price of $0.0781 looks like a steal. The coin is up 4x already, with an additional 5x gain expected before its presale ends. And when the coin launches officially, the sky is going to be the starting point. Dogecoin jumps as Bitcoin hits a new high Bitcoin just set a new record high above $112K , and as usual, the whole crypto market went into overdrive. Dogecoin is a meme token that relies majorly on hype and favorable market sentiments, so the DOGE price also went up. Dogecoin's rise in the last 30 days. Source: Coinmarketcap Specifically, the DOGE price broke a ceiling of $0.244, a level it had been struggling with for weeks. In context, DOGE's price jumped by about 7%, beating Bitcoin's own gain on the daily scale. It takes Dogecoin's spike to 35% on the monthly scene. DOGE price prediction Dogecoin's price chart over the last couple of months has formed a \""cup and handle\"" pattern with a smooth rounded bottom. This signals price consolidation with the handle showing a shallow dip. Such a pattern is associated with low selling pressure and strong buyer interest. Source: BuddyKing/Coinmarketcap As a result, analysts believe that Dogecoin is on the verge of a breakout. The coin just broke the $0.244 resistance, and if this momentum holds volume, its next stop could be $0.35. Can DOGE or RTX hit $10 in the future? Despite its resilience and loyal following, DOGE faces stiff competition from newer, utility-driven projects. Its value is still heavily tied to social media trends and speculative trading, making it vulnerable to sharp corrections and seriously limiting its potential to hit $10. Remittix, on the other hand, packs real-world utility and has momentum on its side. Once this XRP 2.0 hits the limelight, nothing will be able to stop it. That's why experts believe it has a better possibility of reaching $10 in the future. When it hits that level, early adopters would've cupped a 100x ROI at least. That's why it's the go-to for smart investors.

2025-05-25T14:41:29.000Z,"Stellar (XLM) Could Be Breaking Out of an Ascending Channel, Sets Price Target","Stellar’s native token, XLM , is once again grabbing the spotlight as prominent crypto analyst Ali signals a potential breakout from its current ascending channel. According to Ali, XLM could soon target $0.26 if this bullish move is confirmed, sparking fresh excitement within the Stellar community and broader crypto market. #Stellar $XLM could be breaking out of an ascending channel, potentially targeting $0.26! pic.twitter.com/DLSOF4CQOe — Ali (@ali_charts) May 24, 2025 Technical Setup Signals Strength Ali’s analysis, shared on X, highlights the formation of an ascending channel pattern on XLM’s price chart. An ascending channel is typically seen as a bullish continuation pattern, where the price steadily moves higher within two parallel trendlines — each successive high and low higher than the last. A breakout above this channel signals that momentum is intensifying, often triggering a surge as buyers rush in to capitalize on the move. At the time of writing, XLM has been consolidating just below key resistance levels , and Ali suggests that a breakout could open the path toward $0.26, a level not seen since earlier bullish runs. Technical traders and market watchers are now closely observing whether XLM can maintain the necessary volume and strength to push decisively above this channel, confirming the bullish thesis. Stellar’s Ecosystem Growth and Broader Momentum Beyond the chart patterns, Stellar’s network fundamentals have shown consistent progress. As a blockchain designed for cross-border payments and asset issuance, Stellar has been expanding its use cases in emerging markets, financial inclusion, and remittance corridors. Over the past year, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) has also intensified its focus on stablecoin integrations, CBDC exploration, and partnerships with fintechs, helping to anchor XLM’s relevance in the fast-evolving blockchain economy. These fundamental drivers lend additional weight to the bullish sentiment reflected on the charts. While technical setups like ascending channels offer short- to medium-term price insights, long-term investors also keep a close eye on network adoption metrics, developer activity, and institutional collaborations, all of which Stellar has been actively nurturing. What to Watch Moving Forward For traders, the key level to watch now is whether XLM can break and hold above the upper boundary of the ascending channel. A clean break, especially accompanied by a spike in volume, could validate Ali’s $0.26 target and potentially spark further upside. However, as with all technical setups, failure to break resistance might result in a pullback toward the lower boundary of the channel or even a broader consolidation phase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 It’s worth noting that XLM’s movements often correlate with broader market sentiment, particularly Bitcoin’s (BTC) directional bias. If the overall crypto market remains bullish, it could act as a tailwind for XLM’s breakout attempt . On the flip side, any market-wide correction might dampen momentum, even if Stellar’s technicals appear strong. Final Thoughts Ali’s observation about Stellar’s potential breakout underscores the importance of combining technical analysis with an awareness of broader market dynamics and project fundamentals. As Stellar (XLM) approaches this critical juncture, traders and investors alike will be keenly watching whether the token can achieve the $0.26 target, reinforcing its position as a key player in the cross-border blockchain payments space. While breakouts always carry an element of risk, Stellar’s consistent ecosystem growth and rising market attention suggest that the coming weeks could be pivotal for XLM’s price trajectory. As always, participants should stay informed and exercise caution, keeping in mind that the crypto landscape remains highly volatile and fast-moving.

2025-05-25T14:40:00.000Z,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction Models Fall Short: Bitcoin Solaris Emerges as the True Wealth Multiplier for Average Investors","For years, Ripple XRP was seen as a dependable crypto investment—solid, secure, and built for utility. But 2025 is changing the narrative. Something bigger is brewing beneath the surface, and average investors are catching on fast. The focus has shifted to Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S)—a rising star that’s delivering not just promises, but actual wealth-building tools accessible to anyone with a smartphone. Right now, financial analysts are buzzing about this shift. The real surprise? It’s not just whales or insiders paying attention—everyday people are getting in early. XRP: Secure but Static Ripple’s XRP still plays a major role in cross-border payments and boasts partnerships with major institutions. It’s fast and energy-efficient, which is great. But what about growth potential? That’s where the cracks show. Despite its promise, XRP price prediction models have repeatedly missed the mark. The coin has struggled to reach new all-time highs, and its centralized structure leaves little room for true DeFi innovation. It’s safe, but safety doesn’t always lead to real gains. Bitcoin Solaris: The Wealth Multiplier Enter Bitcoin Solaris, the breakout ecosystem offering what XRP can’t: actual ownership and earning potential for regular investors. BTC-S isn’t just a token—it’s a decentralized movement backed by audited smart contracts ( see Freshcoins audit ) and full KYC verification . What sets it apart? Its dual-consensus architecture combines Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work security with the blazing speed and scalability of Delegated Proof-of-Stake. Key Tech Features: 10,000 TPS (transactions per second) 2-second finality 99.95% less energy use than traditional mining Mobile mining with Solaris Nova app (beta access available to select users) This means BTC-S isn’t just built for institutions—it’s designed for people like you. XRP vs. Bitcoin Solaris Feature Ripple XRP Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) Network Speed ~1,500 TPS 10,000 TPS Decentralization Semi-centralized Fully decentralized Mobile Mining Not supported Supported via Nova App Energy Use Low 99.95% lower than BTC Smart Contracts Limited Full DeFi & audited contracts Real-World Access Institution-focused Designed for public use Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed Presale Heating Up: Final Entry Point Before Lift-Off Now in Phase 4, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is drawing explosive interest. Here’s what investors need to know: Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% With a July 31, 2025 launch, the presale only lasts 90 days—making it one of the shortest in the market. Yet it has already raised over $1.2M and attracted more than 8,900 users. The numbers speak for themselves. Some early investors now have access to the Solaris Nova App beta, giving them a head start in mobile mining. It’s not open to everyone yet—but there’s still time for more users to get in before launch. For updates or to join the growing global community, follow the project on Telegram or X . Why Everyone’s Talking From Telegram chats to Twitter threads, Bitcoin Solaris is lighting up the conversation. And it’s not just noise—respected voices are validating the excitement. One standout review comes from Crypto Volt , who breaks down the key reasons this isn’t just hype—it’s a revolution. A Wealth Revolution for Regular People If you’ve been relying on XRP price predictions to build your portfolio, it might be time to reassess. Bitcoin Solaris is doing more than offering upside—it’s offering ownership. It’s giving users the tools to mine from their phones, interact with real DeFi tools, and be part of something truly decentralized. And with its scarcity-based supply, mobile mining innovation, and tech-backed infrastructure, BTC-S doesn’t just promise growth—it delivers real opportunities to multiply wealth in ways XRP simply can’t.

2025-05-25T14:30:23.000Z,"Here’s Where a 64,000% Rally Like 2017 Could Take XRP Price","Analyst \""GalaxyBTC\"" has reignited aggressive sentiment in the XRP community with a chart comparison showing XRP’s current price action closely mimicking its 2017 breakout. According to the chart, XRP has completed a six-year consolidation phase. This culminated in a breakout and retest that resembled the setup preceding XRP's legendary bull run from 2017 to early 2018.Two Key Historical Phases Defining XRP's TrajectorySpecifically, GalaxyBTC’s chart highlights two key phases of price behavior in XRP's history. The first was a 1,267-day consolidation period before the 2017 rally, following a cooldown from the earlier 2013 price surge when XRP traded above $0.05.However, XRP dipped massively after that and added another zero in the following years, until early 2017, when the trend dramatically reversed. XRP surged to over $3, marking a more than 70,000% gain from the end of that consolidation period to its peak.The second key phase in XRP's history was a much longer 2,471-day accumulation phase that ended in late 2024. GalaxyBTC's chart shows XRP breaking through a multi-year descending resistance line, nearly identical to the one that triggered the 2017 breakout.Notably, XRP’s recent breakout has already resulted in a 5X surge before experiencing a brief cooldown. GalaxyBTC emphasized that XRP closely mirrors its historical chart patterns. He suggested that an even more explosive move could follow the prolonged consolidation. XRP historical chart by GalaxyBTC While he provided no exact targets, the chart includes a potential upside to nearly $40 by next year. This would represent a 1,580% increase from the current price of around $2.38. However, some believe this is a conservative estimate based on XRP’s historical performance.XRP to Hit $1,700 in a 64,000% Rally?GalaxyBTC’s post drew attention from several XRP advocates, including commenter Remi Relief, who asserted that XRP would repeat history. He predicts a 64,000% increase that could send XRP to $1,700 by Q4 2025 or Q1 2026. For 2025 alone, his “conservative” estimate is $1,200 per XRP by year-end. Remi also mentioned his broader expectations of an 80,000% to 150,000% increase this cycle, should XRP follow the same trajectory as it did in 2017. “History will be made,” he added.https://twitter.com/RemiReliefX/status/1924886747948675091Reality Check: Market Cap Math Still MattersWhile excitement builds, such bullish forecasts raise eyebrows due to the sheer scale of the projections. A price of $1,700 per XRP would imply a market cap of approximately $100 trillion, which seems impossible and unrealistic.This far exceeds the combined capitalization of Bitcoin and gold and is nearing the total value of the global bond market.While projections of 64,000% to 150,000% gains are extreme, repeated calls for such outcomes highlight the community's optimism that this cycle could mark a new chapter in XRP’s history, after more than seven years below its all-time high.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/25/heres-where-a-64000-rally-like-2017-could-take-xrp-price/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-where-a-64000-rally-like-2017-could-take-xrp-price,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-05-25T14:30:12.000Z,"Bitcoin Advanced NVT Shows No Signs Of Slowing Bullish Momentum – Details","On May 22, Bitcoin registered a new all-time high at $111,970. Since then, market prices have retraced to around $108,000, largely influenced by macroeconomic pressures. Following this development, prominent crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci backs the premier cryptocurrency to soon return and surpass this current all-time high, based on recent on-chain data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back To Daily EMA 8 – Can Bulls Hold Momentum? Bitcoin Advanced NVT Holds Above Key Level: Bullish Continuation Remains In Play The Advanced Network Value to Transactions (NVT) metric is an on-chain valuation model that compares Bitcoin’s market cap to its daily USD transaction volume. It is used to evaluate whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued relative to usage. Generally, higher Advanced NVT values indicate heightened investor speculation, while sustained levels above key thresholds have often coincided with major bull runs. According to Burak Kesmeci in an X post on May 24, the Bitcoin Advanced NVT signal has recently crossed above the +2 standard deviation (+2xSD), a historically significant boundary that signals a period of bullish market strength and robust investor confidence. As seen in Q4 2023 and Q4 2024, an advanced NVT crossover above the +2xSD highlighted in orange in the image below has previously served as a launchpad for bullish continuations, resulting in extended periods of upward momentum. Although the Advanced NVT signal is presently turned downward, Kesmeci explains that as long as this metric remains above the +2xSD level, Bitcoin is likely to maintain its uptrend, indicating there is strong potential for the cryptocurrency to enter new price territory in the coming weeks. With Bitcoin surpassing its former all-time high in the past week, the premier cryptocurrency continues to look likely to attain the lofty price targets being set by several market analysts. However, macroeconomic factors, most notably US trade policy, remain a major influence capable of inducing significant setbacks as seen since the start of 2025.

Meanwhile, the market’s daily trading volume is down by 31.58% and valued at $45.94 billion. According to data from blockchain analytics firm Sentora, the Bitcoin network experienced a 51.03% increase in network fees, signaling a significant rise in transactions and user activities. Meanwhile, exchange inflows were valued at $184 million, which Sentora has described as “mild” relative to previous weeks. This development indicates that many investors opted against selling their BTC holdings despite a new all-time high, signaling long-term market confidence.

2025-05-25T14:30:00.000Z,"Shiba Inu enters the doghouse as whales bail, burn rate slows","Shiba Inu is nearing a local technical bear market after falling by over 17% from its highest point this month. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) was trading at $0.000014 on Sunday, with its 24-hour volume dwindling to $158 million. This volume is much lower than that of other popular meme coins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Pepe ( PEPE ), Official Trump ( TRUMP ), and Bonk ( BONK ). The underperformance is happening because of the ongoing whale and mart money selling and falling burn rate. ShibBurn data shows that the daily burn rate crashed by 85% to 2.14 million. Its weekly burn rate also dropped, with the biggest burn transaction being 23.5 million on Thursday. You might also like: Pepe price forms golden cross despite whale and smart money selling Shiba Inu price often does well when more tokens are being burned, as this reduces the number in circulation and boosts confidence among holders. Over 410 trillion tokens have been burned from the initial supply. Santiment data shows that whales have been on a selling spree since January. Their total supply stood at over 743 trillion on January 19 and has dropped to 725 trillion today. This means that these investors have sold over 18 trillion tokens, a sign that they expect it to keep falling.

2025-05-25T14:23:59.000Z,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Explores the Role and Importance of Crypto ETFs","As the market leader, bitcoin opened the doors for spot crypto ETFs in early 2024 when 11 (at first, then 12) such products were finally greenlighted in the United States following years and years of delays and rejections. Ethereum followed suit in July and now the question is not if but which cryptocurrency will have its own spot exchange-traded fund in the US, with some of the leading contenders being XRP, SOL, DOGE, and LTC. Trying to summarize the importance of crypto ETFs in just one minute, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, outlined two key reasons why these financial vehicles are so important. Institutional Access Before the January 2024 launch of spot BTC ETFs on Wall Street, institutional market participants had to rely on more unusual (for them) access points to get bitcoin exposure, such as cryptocurrency exchanges and self-custody. However, the introduction of these financial vehicles changed the game entirely for them, which is evident from the mindblowing demand for most spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially BlackRock’s IBIT. “So, this was really the first time you had institutions be able to go on Wall Street and trade directly in crypto,” Garlinghouse explained . Capital that previously couldn’t enter the cryptocurrency space, such as endowment, pension funds, or even mutual funds, now has a dozen options to do so. Institutionalizing the Industry The second reason complements the first, Garlinghouse noted, as it simply changes the focus in the cryptocurrency industry, at least for the bigger projects, mostly on larger investors and institutions. As mentioned above, BlackRock’s IBIT broke multiple records in terms of net inflows for its year and a half in existence. “It should be no surprise that a Bitcoin ETF was the fastest ETF ever to get to $1 billion in assets.” It has become a behemoth as its total holdings are double that of the rest of the Bitcoin ETFs combined. As of Friday’s close, BlackRock’s BTC ETF had almost $48 billion in AUM as it continues to dominate the net inflows. IBIT has not seen a single day in the red since the market-wide crashes in early April. Consequently, Garlinghouse predicted that it will eventually close in on the gold ETFs as well. In terms of a spot Ripple ETF, the news from the SEC is somewhat expected as the agency continues to delay making a decision on a couple of filings. Polymarket shows that the chances of an XRP ETF hitting the US markets this year stand at well over 80%, but the percentage drops to 21% when the deadline is set at July 31. Nevertheless, Ripple saw some success on the ETF front as a few futures-based funds went live for trading in the past month or so.

2025-05-25T14:14:29.000Z,"Where Do Crypto Casinos Excel Over Normal Ones?","The gaming industry has witnessed a gigantic transformation with the introduction and spread of crypto casinos, which have created a huge global presence. In 2025, the global crypto casino industry hit $81.4 billion in revenue, beating traditional gambling in some crucial aspects, such as speed of transactions and accessibility to users. In Canada, where gambling has long been a blend of regulated land-based establishments and online, crypto casinos are gaining popularity for their new features, and some of the old guard are getting on board by accepting crypto payments. This piece looks at the ways in which crypto casinos are superior to their traditional equivalents, with particular reference to Canada's changing gambling landscape. Speed and Efficiency of Transactions Cryptocasinos have introduced the standard for the speed at which players can deposit and withdraw funds. In contrast to traditional casinos, which use bank transfers or credit card deposits that could take days, crypto takes mere seconds. In Canada, players are allowed to deposit in Ethereum or Bitcoin and play in a matter of minutes. Withdrawals, being able to take seven days in the traditional setups due to banking delays, are normally taken in hours with crypto. This ease appeals to Canadians who value quickness, especially in an industry where offshore destinations dominate the bulk of sites due to the absence of local online options. Transparency of the blockchain also ensures secure, provable payments, eliminating the hassle of payment contests. But that is not to say that traditional online casinos don’t enjoy a popularity of their own, both due to familiarity and the ease of using traditional banking methods for deposit and payout, while the processing times don’t matter much. Another thing that retains player loyalty and attracts new ones, particularly in Canada, is bonuses like the ones on the Canada Casino Bonuses list, which covers an extensive selection of casinos, and a tactic more and more crypto casinos have adopted for promotion. Enhanced Privacy and Anonymity Crypto casinos score very high in terms of privacy. Traditional casinos require vast amounts of personal information in a bid to meet anti-money laundering laws. Crypto casinos, on the other hand, usually allow players to gamble with little personal data, using only a wallet address. Such anonymity will be attractive to players who prefer anonymity, particularly on offshore platforms operating in the grey market. While traditional casinos are bound by strict Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, crypto casinos tread the line between compliance and anonymity for players, offering a compromise that resonates in an era where privacy is paramount. Innovative Bonuses and Promotions Crypto casinos lead mainstream competition with pushy, tailored bonuses aimed at the population that adopted crypto. Some operators provide a match deposit bonus of up to 400% and free spins, a rate that few mainstream operators offer. These rewards are designed to be attractive to crypto users, leveraging cryptocurrencies' lower cost per transaction to offer more rewards. In Canada, where some casinos have started accepting payments in cryptocurrency, traditional casinos are integrating retro loyalty programs with crypto-appealing rewards, such as instant cashback rewards in Bitcoin. However, crypto casinos lead the charge by incorporating blockchain-based rewards like tokenized loyalty points that bricks-and-mortar casinos can't keep up with due to their reliance on centralized systems. Global Access and Market Presence Crypto casinos break down geographical barriers that encumber traditional casinos. In Canada, while provinces like Alberta legalized online gambling for private operators, crypto sites thrive by catering to players across borders without the currency conversion hassles. Old-fashioned brick-and-mortar casinos, even those that have an online extension, tend to be rooted in local banking systems and currency controls. The borderless nature of crypto ensures that players can easily join international sites with stablecoins or big cryptocurrencies. Such convenience has fueled the industry's $81.4 billion revenue, as crypto casinos poach players from jurisdictions where conventional gambling is hampered by regulation or practical difficulties. Blending the Best of Both Worlds Some Canadian old-school casinos are weathering the crypto storm without overhauling their model. They’ve done it by adding crypto payments alongside traditional means like Interac and credit cards. These sites offer familiarity with brand names along with the benefit of crypto's speed and security. Nevertheless, they are based on traditional forms, physical location, or old infrastructures that limit them in embracing pure blockchain technology innovation, like provably fair games or NFT incentives. Crypto casinos, however, are built from scratch for cryptocurrency, giving them a head start in technology incorporation and adaptability. Challenges and the Way Forward As quick, as private, and as innovative as crypto casinos are, they are subject to regulatory scrutiny in Canada. Ontario's bid to regulate offshore gambling advertisements and Alberta's move to bring the online markets under regulation are signs of tighter monitoring. Traditional casinos have established trust and regulatory clarity, something crypto sites are still working through. Yet the $81.4 billion crypto betting market does not ease up, driven by sites that prioritize user experience and technological prowess. As Canada’s gambling scene keeps evolving, crypto casinos are likely to keep pushing boundaries, while traditional operators adapt selectively to stay competitive.

The initiative is part of a national digital transformation plan led by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local broadcaster 24NewsHD TV Channel. In the initial phase, the government will divert excess power toward building AI infrastructure and crypto mining facilities. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that the strategy could attract billions of dollars in foreign investment and create thousands of high-tech jobs across the country. To ensure sustainable development, the second phase of the initiative will incorporate renewable energy sources into the mining process, aiming to minimize environmental impact while boosting Pakistan’s role in the global digital economy . Tax Incentives and Regulatory Reforms The government is also rolling out a comprehensive package of financial incentives to draw interest from global tech investors. These include tax breaks for AI centers and import duty exemptions for Bitcoin miners. As a result, international companies have already begun visiting Pakistan to explore potential partnerships. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, hailed the announcement as a “turning point” for the country’s digital economy. Saqib has been a vocal proponent of using the country’s excess electricity for crypto mining and first introduced the idea during the Council’s inaugural meeting on March 21. The meeting included top officials such as the State Bank of Pakistan’s governor, the SECP chairman, and the federal IT secretary. In a further show of support, the country’s Ministry of Finance endorsed the establishment of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) on May 21. The PDAA will regulate blockchain-related financial infrastructure, including exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, and tokenized platforms. It will also oversee the monetization of surplus electricity through regulated Bitcoin mining and help startups scale blockchain-based solutions. Pakistan Eyes Leading Role in Digital Finance Pakistan’s recent efforts to formalize its crypto sector align with its strong performance on the global stage. The country ranked ninth in Chainalysis’ 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index, driven primarily by high retail participation. According to Statista, the number of crypto users in Pakistan is projected to surpass 27 million by 2025, highlighting the sector’s rapid growth in a population of 247 million. With infrastructure, incentives, and regulation all moving into place, Pakistan appears poised to become a major hub in the digital asset and AI landscape.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs have seen approximately $2.77 billion in inflows since launching in July 2024.Wood said that spot Ether ETFs were “less successful than people were expecting” because the US Securities and Exchange Commission did not allow staking. On May 21, the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund.However, Wood still views Ether as the entry point for new investors to familiarize themselves with smart contracts before exploring other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL). “So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” Wood said.Related: ‘We are worried about a recession,’ but there’s a silver lining — Cathie WoodWood said that the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), in January on the Solana network may have caused investors to be skeptical of Solana.“Institutions and you’re saying 60-year-olds…I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” Wood said.

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It’s not taking place here at the White House.”Related: Pictures give glimpse inside Trump’s memecoin holder dinnerTrump features presidential seal at private propertiesThis isn’t the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties.

He explained that, since half of all capital in the world is essentially seeking the best store of value, more capital will “osmotically flow” into Bitcoin over time.“Over the last 2 years, an exodus from fiat assets (bonds and money) has already begun. Hard money assets (Bitcoin and gold) are where things are shifting,” he said.Source: Jesse MyersMyers said that there is around $318 trillion of capital in bonds “looking for greener pastures.” He said most of this capital is tied up in fixed-income institutional vehicles with “strict mandates.” “That’s where Bitcoin Treasury Companies come in,” Myers said.“Treasury Cos will be the primary bidders for BTC over the coming decades, deploying an ocean of SoV capital to BTC.”Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high, and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetWhile Strategy has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, other treasury companies are starting to emerge.On April 24, Twenty One Capital formed, which is a Bitcoin treasury company led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald.

Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material chargesEisenberg charged with child pornographyIn a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.In the Solana ecosystem, the \""Non-Chief Marketing Officer\"" (nCMO) is a role within the Solana Foundation that focuses on supporting the Solana community's marketing efforts.Related: Fractionalization of real world assets: Is this the holy grail of blockchain tech?Markets remain above historical averagesPublic equity markets in the US have been trading above their historical valuation norms for a long time.

2025-05-23T20:00:00.000Z,"Crypto Biz: From shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar to shorting the US dollar","When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo.Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructureBanco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily.SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services.Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik.Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claimsAmerica’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell.In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets. At the time of its launch, the YLDS stablecoin offered a yield of 3.85%.Pi Protocol and Spark Protocol have also developed interest-bearing tokens. Source: Austin CampbellStrategy continues to stack satsWith Bitcoin back above $100,000, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm, Strategy, has resumed its buying spree by acquiring 7,390 BTC last week for approximately $765 million.The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, with an unrealized gain of around $20 billion.The announcement came just two days before Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time high, climbing above $109,000 for the first time since January.

That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That increases the likelihood of a drop to $1.60 and subsequently to $1.27.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) turned down sharply from the $693 resistance on May 23, signaling aggressive selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart.

The bulls will again try to thrust the price above $693. If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($612).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) climbed above the $180 resistance on May 23, but the bears are posing a strong challenge at $185.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($167) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.

In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders. With over $200 billion in circulation and US Federal Reserve interest rates at 4.3%, Pendle estimates that stablecoin holders are missing out on more than $9 billion in annual yield.Pendle TVL share by assets.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:52:03.000Z,"Who attended Trump’s controversial memecoin dinner?","The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.However, some attendees spoke to the press or took to social media to talk about the dinner. Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack. Source: CoinGeckoSui’s Cetus devs have a phantom exchange on SolanaA similar negotiation strategy used by the Cetus team on Sui was successfully employed years ago to recover funds for Crema. The Solana project hasn’t posted on its X account since March 2023, and its trading platform now sees negligible volume, but it still didn’t end well for the hacker.Crema suffered an approximately $9-million hack in 2022. Much like the Cetus case, the Crema hacker was offered a deal to return the funds while keeping $1.6 million in exchange for not reporting the attack to law enforcement.Cetus offers a $6-million reward and exemption from further legal action from the project if the remaining funds are returned.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why? The ‘founders’ own the majority of supply & there are only 114 validators!” Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, wrote on X.Some users challenge Bons’ claim, arguing that decentralization doesn’t mean a free-for-all. Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit. Source: CoinGeckoSui and Cetus backlash contrasts recent hacksThe Cetus exploit has spotlighted the persistent security challenges in DeFi while raising deeper questions around who holds the reins in supposedly decentralized networks like Sui.The team’s $6-million offer to the hacker mirrors the playbook it used with Crema — but this time, the crypto community isn’t as forgiving. With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice?

2025-05-23T13:00:00.000Z,"Ledn ditches ETH, shifts to full custody model for Bitcoin loans","Digital asset lender Ledn is transitioning to fully collateralized Bitcoin lending and discontinuing support for Ethereum, in moves designed to consolidate its BTC-focused business and further safeguard client assets against credit risks.In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin (BTC) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event.This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash.Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000.

Despite the correction, there are mixed signals about whether the price rally is overheated or whether this is a healthy pullback. Bitcoin “still not overheated” — analystBitcoin is not showing any signs of being overheated despite reaching new all-time highs this week, with several analysts pointing to fundamentals suggesting Bitcoin could rise further.“Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited,” said CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan in a May 22 Quicktake note. Crypto Dan pointed out that Bitcoin’s funding rate, an indicator of market overheating, shows an increase in long bets. However, these bets “remain much smaller compared to previous peaks,” suggesting “futures market overheating is negligible.”Bitcoin funding rates and STH SOPR.

2025-05-23T08:47:40.000Z,"DeFi near-zero onboarding costs can help 1.4B unbanked: 1inch co-founder","Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have a major cost advantage over traditional banks when it comes to onboarding new users, according to Anton Bukov, co-founder of decentralized exchange (DEX) 1inch.Speaking at a panel during Dutch Blockchain Week on May 22 in Amsterdam, Bukov said traditional banks spend between $100 and $300 per user to verify documents and set up accounts. Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The bill is now headed to debate on the Senate floor.Earlier this week, White House crypto czar David Sacks said he expects the bill will be passed and that it will receive bipartisan support.However, high-ranking Democrats plan to amend the bill to include a clause prohibiting President Donald Trump and other US officials from profiting from stablecoins.Trump and his family launched the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, which created the USD1 stablecoin in March.

The firm speculates those features could “still be in development or is forthcoming in future updates.” Moonlock says hackers are offering malware for would-be thieves to steal from Ledger users. Source: Moonlock“This isn’t just a theft. It’s a high-stakes effort to outsmart one of the most trusted tools in the crypto world. And the thieves are not backing down,” Moonlock said. “On dark web forums, chatter around anti-Ledger schemes is growing. The next wave is already taking shape. Hackers will continue to exploit the trust crypto owners place in Ledger Live.” Related: Ledger secures Discord after hacker bot tried to steal seed phrasesTo avoid falling prey to similar malware scams, the cybersecurity firm recommends being wary of any page that warns of a critical error and asks for a 24-word recovery phrase.At the same time, never share a seed phrase with anyone or input it on any website, no matter how legitimate it looks, and only download Ledger Live from its official source. Ledger didn’t immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-fake-ledger-apps-to-steal-seed-phrases?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

Democratic lawmakers have already called for an investigation into Trump’s connections to the platform, which was largely dismissed as “flawed” by WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff.Stablecoins are just one of many potential conflicts, say DemocratsMerkley and Warren are also planning responses to Trump hosting a dinner at his golf club for up to 220 people who purchased the most significant amounts of his personal memecoin. Merkley is expected to attend a protest organized by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, outside the Trump venue on May 22. Warren held a press conference with Merkley, Senator Chris Murphy and Public Citizen representatives, calling on Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner event. Though a few of the potential attendees have publicly announced they were the owners of the wallets who purchased the memecoin and intended to go, the majority were still anonymous at the time of publication.“What is happening tonight — this private, secret dinner — in which individuals who have put money in Donald Trump’s pocket, get access to him, is maybe the most corrupt of all the corruption,” said Murphy, adding:“They were able to pay their way in to get an audience with the President of the United States to ask for favorable national security concessions.”Cointelegraph reached out to the White House for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senators-amendment-genius-act-world-liberty-financial-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-22T21:09:51.000Z,"XRP price fails to respond to two extremely bullish developments — Here is why","Key takeaways:The SEC’s decision on a spot XRP ETF could ignite a significant rally.The current $2.2 billion in XRP futures hints at growing institutional investor demand.The two most bullish events ever imagined by XRP (XRP) advocates happened in 2025, but XRP continues to underperform the cryptocurrency market. On March 6, XRP was listed as a candidate for the United States' “Digital Asset Reserve,” and Ripple Labs settled a multi-year-long complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8.XRP/USD (blue) vs. crypto market capitalization. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphXRP fell 6% in the three months leading up to May 22, while overall crypto market capitalization rose 10%. Traders remain hopeful for a 45% rally to $3.50, with derivatives metrics signaling rising confidence.Leverage use ramps up ahead of potential spot XRP ETF listingThe aggregate open interest on XRP futures on major exchanges jumped to 923 million XRP on May 22, up 31% from two weeks prior. The $2.2 billion position in futures markets signals growing interest from traders, but it is not necessarily bullish, as those instruments can also be used to speculate on the XRP price downside.XRP futures open interest on major exchanges, XRP. Source: CoinGlassSome traders argue that the increased demand for leveraged XRP positions indicates growing institutional interest, especially as multiple issuers filed for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in the US. However, the final decision by the US SEC should be made in October.Excessive demand for bullish leveraged XRP causes a positive funding rate, meaning longs (buyers) are the ones paying the carry cost. As cryptocurrency traders are generally optimistic, a 7% to 14% annualized funding rate is expected in neutral markets, while periods of FOMO can push the indicator above 50%.XRP futures annualized funding rate. Source: Laevitas.chThe annualized funding rate jumped to 19% on May 22, nearing the highest levels in six months. Still, the current optimism level is nowhere near the 100% annualized funding rate from Dec. 4, 2024, which followed an impressive 7-day rally to $2.90 from $1.33. Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions. Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
