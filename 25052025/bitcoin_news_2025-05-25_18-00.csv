2025-05-25T15:54:20.000Z,"Bitcoin Rainbow chart predicts BTC price for June 1, 2025","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) Rainbow Chart has issued fresh insights into how the asset will likely start June, just days after clinching a record high. Notably, this comes as Bitcoin’s bullish run has hit a bump. The asset lost the $110,000 support after briefly soaring above an all-time high of above $111,000 mid-week, a surge driven largely by institutional capital inflows. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $107,498, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours but up nearly the same value over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Amid the current momentum, Bitcoin is approaching overbought territory as the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) reads 63. However, the short- and long-term outlooks remain bullish, with the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ) sitting lower at $94,730 and $86,569, respectively. Bitcoin price prediction for June 1 The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, using a logarithmic growth curve to illustrate investor sentiment across price levels, offers a glimpse into what might lie ahead for June 1. Its nine color-coded zones span from “Bitcoin is dead” (severe bearishness) to “Maximum Bubble Territory” (extreme overvaluation). According to the chart, Bitcoin is projected to trade between approximately $32,787 and $372,813 on June 1, with each band representing a distinct level of sentiment. Bitcoin Rainbow chart. Source: BlockhainCenter At the lower end, prices below $43,000 suggest a “Basically a Fire Sale,” signaling that Bitcoin could be severely undervalued. The $43,000 to $58,000 range, the chart indicates a “BUY!” zone, encouraging accumulation. Moving higher, the $58,000 to $75,000 band reflects the “Accumulate” zone, suggesting cautious optimism. Between $75,000 and $97,800, the sentiment shifts to “Still cheap,” indicating that Bitcoin remains reasonably priced for long-term holders. Next, the $97,800 to $128,600 range enters the“HODL!” phase, a call to resist the urge to sell. Given the current price, this level is the most likely scenario for June 1. Beyond that, prices between $128,600 and $164,400 raise the question, “Is this a bubble?” hinting at potential overheating. Bitcoin’s extreme bullish zone If Bitcoin climbs into the $164,400 to $211,400 range, the market may experience intensified FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). A further surge into the $211,400 to $276,300 band would call for serious caution with a “Sell. Seriously, SELL!” label. Finally, prices between $276,300 and $372,800 would place Bitcoin in the “Maximum Bubble Territory,” indicating extreme overvaluation. Although the Rainbow Chart provides an insightful visualization of Bitcoin’s historical price behavior, it’s not a precise predictive tool. It extrapolates long-term trends based on logarithmic growth, but unpredictable factors like macroeconomic events, regulations, and technological changes can impact future prices. Still, it is a valuable guide for investors and traders gauging Bitcoin’s potential trajectory.

The high-profile investor subsequently increased his Bitcoin ( BTC ) exposure, which currently stands at 11,070 BTC, worth roughly $1.19 billion.

The trading activity is a major change in Wynn’s portfolio allocation following his recent success with Pepe (PEPE) trades. Earlier this week, the trader closed all his PEPE long positions for a total profit of $25.19 million.

2025-05-25T15:13:32.000Z,"Surprise XRP Price Prediction: This Ripple Rival Is Tipped To Lead Altcoin Season Instead","XRP has long been seen as crypto’s remittance king, a sleek solution to cross-border payments, backed by Ripple’s bold vision to take on the banks. And with regulatory hurdles finally fading, many expected XRP to lead the charge into the next altcoin season. But that may no longer be the case. Enter Remittix (RTX) , a rising PayFi protocol priced under $0.10 and already drawing whispers from analysts who believe it, not XRP, could ignite the next altcoin rally. While XRP leans on legacy and legal victories, Remittix is building in real time: seamless crypto-to-fiat transfers, bank payouts without middlemen and a presale haul north of $15 million. It’s not just another token, it’s everything XRP promised to be, rebuilt on Ethereum with none of the baggage. And in a market where speed and utility are king, this dark horse might just run ahead of the pack. XRP stalls while Bitcoin soars and a new rival gains ground Just as Bitcoin soared to $111,807 on the back of $934M in daily ETF inflows, XRP moved in the opposite direction. While the broader market rallied, XRP slipped from $2.44 to $2.31 in a day, weighed down by macroeconomic pressures and sector-specific challenges. Source: Coingecko Geopolitical tensions added fuel to market uncertainty. Trump’s threat of a 50% EU import tariff shook global markets, boosting Bitcoin, but not XRP. While institutions piled into BTC, XRP saw little love. In the XRP price prediction space, this gap has sparked new concerns about Ripple’s resilience. Compounding the issue was JPMorgan’s announcement of a “Wall Street stablecoin” initiative in collaboration with three major U.S. banks. The project spooked investors and sent ripples through Ripple’s $300 million RLUSD market. Combined with the closure of several short positions, these moves magnified volatility and sparked concerns over XRP’s ability to hold ground in an increasingly crowded PayFi arena. Despite its struggles, XRP is far from down and out. The token remains one of crypto’s most recognized assets and its utility in global remittances still holds weight. But as competition heats up, from banks, blockchains and next-gen players like Remittix, XRP’s future will depend not just on the tide of Bitcoin’s rise, but on how it adapts to a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Investors eyeing their next move are watching closely. Remittix is racing ahead while Ripple watches from the sidelines While XRP fights headwinds, a rising star is quietly stealing the spotlight. Remittix, a PayFiupstart built on Ethereum, is redefining how money moves across borders. No intermediaries. No correspondent banks. Just clean, instant transactions, with transparent fees that leave both banks and traditional platforms in the dust. Source: YouTube The buzz is real. With over 536 million RTX tokens sold and $15.3 million raised in its presale at just $0.0781 per token, Remittix is closing in on 20,000 token holders. Momentum is accelerating as users flock to a platform that actually delivers on crypto’s original promise: faster, cheaper, and borderless finance. Behind the scenes, it’s more than hype. A powerhouse team of developers, blockchain engineers, fintech veterans, and compliance experts has quietly been assembled. Remittix has already locked in key licensing frameworks, ensuring that fiat payout corridors meet full KYC/AML compliance in every target region. That’s no small feat in a regulatory minefield. And now, the first look at the Remittix Wallet is out. Sleek, intuitive and built for real-world use, it’s a non-custodial wallet that holds $RTX and other tokens while linking seamlessly to fiat rails. If XRP is still asking how to bridge crypto and cash, Remittix may have already answered. Conclusion XRP’s legacy still holds weight, but in today’s fast-moving market, legacy isn’t enough. While Ripple watches from the sidelines, Remittix is executing in real time. With utility, speed and a $15.3M presale to back it, this Ethereum-based upstart might just rewrite the XRP price prediction playbook entirely.

2025-05-25T15:09:15.000Z,"Cathie Wood says crypto ETFs will shine as wallets soar","Ark Investment Management founder and CEO Cathie Wood says cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are here to stay as the growth of crypto wallets continues to expand. Speaking at the Solana Accelerate event in New York, Wood highlighted that while crypto wallets offer added protection and independence, the ease and convenience of ETFs will keep them popular among traditional investors . She commented: I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button. – Cathie Wood Cathie Wood says wallets act as insurance policies for investors Wood argued that ETFs will remain attractive to those using them for convenience, though these crypto products may ultimately act as a bridge to wallet-based solutions. She added that investors are still drawn to the offer of decentralization wallets, saying they are “insurance policies” against failures in traditional financial systems . So far, there are roughly 200 million active Bitcoin wallets globally, per Bitbo’s data. Meanwhile, U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw around $2.75 billion in inflows during the trading week ending May 23, as Bitcoin surged to a record high of $111,970 on May 22. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have received over $44 billion in inflows, while spot Ether ETFs have only recorded $2.77 billion since launch. Wood explained that Ether ETFs saw less success because the US Securities and Exchanges Commission did not permit staking . Nonetheless, she believes Ether could be the gateway for new investors to understand smart contracts before moving on to assets like Solana. Eric Balchunas, interviewing Wood, also claimed that several investors are hoping for a Solana ETF more than Ether or XRP ETFs. Wood, however, claimed that President Trump’s decision to introduce his memecoin, TRUMP, on the Solana network may have altered some investors’ perception of the SOL token and network, making them more cautious and skeptical. Nonetheless, she said she would share her Solana price projection once she’s done with her analysis. VanEck criticizes the SEC for delaying its decision on ETF filings without proper communication VanEck recently aimed at the SEC for what it termed as delays on several Bitcoin ETF-related applications. The firm’s head of research, Matthew Sigel, argued that the commission’s postponements affect its options trading application tied to its spot Bitcoin ETF. The investment management company criticized the company for poor communication and unclear reasoning behind the delays. Sigel cited the delay of CBOE’s 19b-4 filing on the HODL options listing, claiming the regulatory agency postponed its decision without a proper explanation. While the commission put off its approval for several filings, it is still accepting new submissions. The SEC also delayed its decision on the firm’s in-kind creation and redemption for its spot Bitcoin ETF. Similarly, Fidelity’s filing on in-kind redemptions on its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs was postponed, and no decision timeline was provided. Additionally, on May 22, the agency put off its ruling on CoinShares spot XRP ETF application. However, it did provide a timeline, pushing its deadline from May 26 to August 24. The agency also asked for public input on the firm’s filing, which added more uncertainty. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-05-25T14:46:22.000Z,"Comparing Dogecoin (DOGE) and 'XRP 2.0' Remittix (RTX) Chances Of Hitting $10 In Future","In this article, meme king Dogecoin (DOGE) goes head to head against Remittix (RTX), a rapidly rising PayFi protocol dubbed XRP 2.0. Dogecoin is on a bullish trend after recovering from the slump of the last few months. Remittix , on the other hand, has appreciated by a whopping 420% in 2025 and doesn't seem to be slowing down. Which of these tokens has a better chance of hitting $10 in the future? Let's find out. Remittix: An ambitious PayFi solution that is heading to the top Cross-border transactions have been a global financial headache for many years. These payments are known to be expensive, slow, and at times, downright frustrating. The global remittances industry is worth over $800 billion but is still plagued by these issues. But the arrival of Remittixis set to put an end to these problems. This is because Remittix leverages the power of blockchain technology to provide faster, cheaper, and more efficient cross-border transactions. It connects over 30 blockchains with payment networks worldwide to allow its users to send crypto, right from their wallets, to any bank account in fiat. Such groundbreaking solutions are rare these days, and that is why Remittix has quickly gained traction. Even though it is still in presale, it has already earned the term \""XRP 2.0,\"" and investors are jumping onto its bandwagon in droves. With a potential big enough to disrupt global remittances, Remittix's current price of $0.0781 looks like a steal. The coin is up 4x already, with an additional 5x gain expected before its presale ends. And when the coin launches officially, the sky is going to be the starting point. Dogecoin jumps as Bitcoin hits a new high Bitcoin just set a new record high above $112K , and as usual, the whole crypto market went into overdrive. Dogecoin is a meme token that relies majorly on hype and favorable market sentiments, so the DOGE price also went up. Dogecoin's rise in the last 30 days. Source: Coinmarketcap Specifically, the DOGE price broke a ceiling of $0.244, a level it had been struggling with for weeks. In context, DOGE's price jumped by about 7%, beating Bitcoin's own gain on the daily scale. It takes Dogecoin's spike to 35% on the monthly scene. DOGE price prediction Dogecoin's price chart over the last couple of months has formed a \""cup and handle\"" pattern with a smooth rounded bottom. This signals price consolidation with the handle showing a shallow dip. Such a pattern is associated with low selling pressure and strong buyer interest. Source: BuddyKing/Coinmarketcap As a result, analysts believe that Dogecoin is on the verge of a breakout. The coin just broke the $0.244 resistance, and if this momentum holds volume, its next stop could be $0.35. Can DOGE or RTX hit $10 in the future? Despite its resilience and loyal following, DOGE faces stiff competition from newer, utility-driven projects. Its value is still heavily tied to social media trends and speculative trading, making it vulnerable to sharp corrections and seriously limiting its potential to hit $10. Remittix, on the other hand, packs real-world utility and has momentum on its side. Once this XRP 2.0 hits the limelight, nothing will be able to stop it. That's why experts believe it has a better possibility of reaching $10 in the future. When it hits that level, early adopters would've cupped a 100x ROI at least. That's why it's the go-to for smart investors.

2025-05-25T14:41:29.000Z,"Stellar (XLM) Could Be Breaking Out of an Ascending Channel, Sets Price Target","Stellar’s native token, XLM , is once again grabbing the spotlight as prominent crypto analyst Ali signals a potential breakout from its current ascending channel. According to Ali, XLM could soon target $0.26 if this bullish move is confirmed, sparking fresh excitement within the Stellar community and broader crypto market. #Stellar $XLM could be breaking out of an ascending channel, potentially targeting $0.26! pic.twitter.com/DLSOF4CQOe — Ali (@ali_charts) May 24, 2025 Technical Setup Signals Strength Ali’s analysis, shared on X, highlights the formation of an ascending channel pattern on XLM’s price chart. An ascending channel is typically seen as a bullish continuation pattern, where the price steadily moves higher within two parallel trendlines — each successive high and low higher than the last. A breakout above this channel signals that momentum is intensifying, often triggering a surge as buyers rush in to capitalize on the move. At the time of writing, XLM has been consolidating just below key resistance levels , and Ali suggests that a breakout could open the path toward $0.26, a level not seen since earlier bullish runs. Technical traders and market watchers are now closely observing whether XLM can maintain the necessary volume and strength to push decisively above this channel, confirming the bullish thesis. Stellar’s Ecosystem Growth and Broader Momentum Beyond the chart patterns, Stellar’s network fundamentals have shown consistent progress. As a blockchain designed for cross-border payments and asset issuance, Stellar has been expanding its use cases in emerging markets, financial inclusion, and remittance corridors. Over the past year, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) has also intensified its focus on stablecoin integrations, CBDC exploration, and partnerships with fintechs, helping to anchor XLM’s relevance in the fast-evolving blockchain economy. These fundamental drivers lend additional weight to the bullish sentiment reflected on the charts. While technical setups like ascending channels offer short- to medium-term price insights, long-term investors also keep a close eye on network adoption metrics, developer activity, and institutional collaborations, all of which Stellar has been actively nurturing. What to Watch Moving Forward For traders, the key level to watch now is whether XLM can break and hold above the upper boundary of the ascending channel. A clean break, especially accompanied by a spike in volume, could validate Ali’s $0.26 target and potentially spark further upside. However, as with all technical setups, failure to break resistance might result in a pullback toward the lower boundary of the channel or even a broader consolidation phase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 It’s worth noting that XLM’s movements often correlate with broader market sentiment, particularly Bitcoin’s (BTC) directional bias. If the overall crypto market remains bullish, it could act as a tailwind for XLM’s breakout attempt . On the flip side, any market-wide correction might dampen momentum, even if Stellar’s technicals appear strong. Final Thoughts Ali’s observation about Stellar’s potential breakout underscores the importance of combining technical analysis with an awareness of broader market dynamics and project fundamentals. As Stellar (XLM) approaches this critical juncture, traders and investors alike will be keenly watching whether the token can achieve the $0.26 target, reinforcing its position as a key player in the cross-border blockchain payments space. While breakouts always carry an element of risk, Stellar’s consistent ecosystem growth and rising market attention suggest that the coming weeks could be pivotal for XLM’s price trajectory. As always, participants should stay informed and exercise caution, keeping in mind that the crypto landscape remains highly volatile and fast-moving.

2025-05-25T14:40:00.000Z,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction Models Fall Short: Bitcoin Solaris Emerges as the True Wealth Multiplier for Average Investors","For years, Ripple XRP was seen as a dependable crypto investment—solid, secure, and built for utility. But 2025 is changing the narrative. Something bigger is brewing beneath the surface, and average investors are catching on fast. The focus has shifted to Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S)—a rising star that’s delivering not just promises, but actual wealth-building tools accessible to anyone with a smartphone. Right now, financial analysts are buzzing about this shift. The real surprise? It’s not just whales or insiders paying attention—everyday people are getting in early. XRP: Secure but Static Ripple’s XRP still plays a major role in cross-border payments and boasts partnerships with major institutions. It’s fast and energy-efficient, which is great. But what about growth potential? That’s where the cracks show. Despite its promise, XRP price prediction models have repeatedly missed the mark. The coin has struggled to reach new all-time highs, and its centralized structure leaves little room for true DeFi innovation. It’s safe, but safety doesn’t always lead to real gains. Bitcoin Solaris: The Wealth Multiplier Enter Bitcoin Solaris, the breakout ecosystem offering what XRP can’t: actual ownership and earning potential for regular investors. BTC-S isn’t just a token—it’s a decentralized movement backed by audited smart contracts ( see Freshcoins audit ) and full KYC verification . What sets it apart? Its dual-consensus architecture combines Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work security with the blazing speed and scalability of Delegated Proof-of-Stake. Key Tech Features: 10,000 TPS (transactions per second) 2-second finality 99.95% less energy use than traditional mining Mobile mining with Solaris Nova app (beta access available to select users) This means BTC-S isn’t just built for institutions—it’s designed for people like you. XRP vs. Bitcoin Solaris Feature Ripple XRP Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) Network Speed ~1,500 TPS 10,000 TPS Decentralization Semi-centralized Fully decentralized Mobile Mining Not supported Supported via Nova App Energy Use Low 99.95% lower than BTC Smart Contracts Limited Full DeFi & audited contracts Real-World Access Institution-focused Designed for public use Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed Presale Heating Up: Final Entry Point Before Lift-Off Now in Phase 4, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is drawing explosive interest. Here’s what investors need to know: Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% With a July 31, 2025 launch, the presale only lasts 90 days—making it one of the shortest in the market. Yet it has already raised over $1.2M and attracted more than 8,900 users. The numbers speak for themselves. Some early investors now have access to the Solaris Nova App beta, giving them a head start in mobile mining. It’s not open to everyone yet—but there’s still time for more users to get in before launch. For updates or to join the growing global community, follow the project on Telegram or X . Why Everyone’s Talking From Telegram chats to Twitter threads, Bitcoin Solaris is lighting up the conversation. And it’s not just noise—respected voices are validating the excitement. One standout review comes from Crypto Volt , who breaks down the key reasons this isn’t just hype—it’s a revolution. A Wealth Revolution for Regular People If you’ve been relying on XRP price predictions to build your portfolio, it might be time to reassess. Bitcoin Solaris is doing more than offering upside—it’s offering ownership. It’s giving users the tools to mine from their phones, interact with real DeFi tools, and be part of something truly decentralized. And with its scarcity-based supply, mobile mining innovation, and tech-backed infrastructure, BTC-S doesn’t just promise growth—it delivers real opportunities to multiply wealth in ways XRP simply can’t.

2025-05-25T14:30:12.000Z,"Bitcoin Advanced NVT Shows No Signs Of Slowing Bullish Momentum – Details","On May 22, Bitcoin registered a new all-time high at $111,970. Since then, market prices have retraced to around $108,000, largely influenced by macroeconomic pressures. Following this development, prominent crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci backs the premier cryptocurrency to soon return and surpass this current all-time high, based on recent on-chain data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back To Daily EMA 8 – Can Bulls Hold Momentum? Bitcoin Advanced NVT Holds Above Key Level: Bullish Continuation Remains In Play The Advanced Network Value to Transactions (NVT) metric is an on-chain valuation model that compares Bitcoin’s market cap to its daily USD transaction volume. It is used to evaluate whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued relative to usage. Generally, higher Advanced NVT values indicate heightened investor speculation, while sustained levels above key thresholds have often coincided with major bull runs. According to Burak Kesmeci in an X post on May 24, the Bitcoin Advanced NVT signal has recently crossed above the +2 standard deviation (+2xSD), a historically significant boundary that signals a period of bullish market strength and robust investor confidence. As seen in Q4 2023 and Q4 2024, an advanced NVT crossover above the +2xSD highlighted in orange in the image below has previously served as a launchpad for bullish continuations, resulting in extended periods of upward momentum. Although the Advanced NVT signal is presently turned downward, Kesmeci explains that as long as this metric remains above the +2xSD level, Bitcoin is likely to maintain its uptrend, indicating there is strong potential for the cryptocurrency to enter new price territory in the coming weeks. With Bitcoin surpassing its former all-time high in the past week, the premier cryptocurrency continues to look likely to attain the lofty price targets being set by several market analysts. However, macroeconomic factors, most notably US trade policy, remain a major influence capable of inducing significant setbacks as seen since the start of 2025.

Meanwhile, exchange inflows were valued at $184 million, which Sentora has described as “mild” relative to previous weeks. This development indicates that many investors opted against selling their BTC holdings despite a new all-time high, signaling long-term market confidence.

2025-05-25T14:30:00.000Z,"Shiba Inu enters the doghouse as whales bail, burn rate slows","Shiba Inu is nearing a local technical bear market after falling by over 17% from its highest point this month. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) was trading at $0.000014 on Sunday, with its 24-hour volume dwindling to $158 million. This volume is much lower than that of other popular meme coins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Pepe ( PEPE ), Official Trump ( TRUMP ), and Bonk ( BONK ). The underperformance is happening because of the ongoing whale and mart money selling and falling burn rate. ShibBurn data shows that the daily burn rate crashed by 85% to 2.14 million. Its weekly burn rate also dropped, with the biggest burn transaction being 23.5 million on Thursday. You might also like: Pepe price forms golden cross despite whale and smart money selling Shiba Inu price often does well when more tokens are being burned, as this reduces the number in circulation and boosts confidence among holders. Over 410 trillion tokens have been burned from the initial supply. Santiment data shows that whales have been on a selling spree since January. Their total supply stood at over 743 trillion on January 19 and has dropped to 725 trillion today. This means that these investors have sold over 18 trillion tokens, a sign that they expect it to keep falling.

In the past, a strong Bitcoin surge would have pushed Shiba Inu higher. Another data by Nansen shows that smart money investors have also sold their SHIB tokens. They now hold 14.13 billion tokens, down from 14.53 billion on April 8.

Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news On the positive side, there are signs that the SHIB price has bottomed. The daily chart shows that it is stuck at the 100-day Exponential Moving Average. It has also formed a cup and handle pattern, with the upper side at $0.00001733. The recent decline is part of the formation of the handle section. This cup has a depth of about 40%. Therefore, measuring the same distance from its upper side brings the target at $0.00002443.

2025-05-25T14:23:59.000Z,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Explores the Role and Importance of Crypto ETFs","As the market leader, bitcoin opened the doors for spot crypto ETFs in early 2024 when 11 (at first, then 12) such products were finally greenlighted in the United States following years and years of delays and rejections. Ethereum followed suit in July and now the question is not if but which cryptocurrency will have its own spot exchange-traded fund in the US, with some of the leading contenders being XRP, SOL, DOGE, and LTC. Trying to summarize the importance of crypto ETFs in just one minute, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, outlined two key reasons why these financial vehicles are so important. Institutional Access Before the January 2024 launch of spot BTC ETFs on Wall Street, institutional market participants had to rely on more unusual (for them) access points to get bitcoin exposure, such as cryptocurrency exchanges and self-custody. However, the introduction of these financial vehicles changed the game entirely for them, which is evident from the mindblowing demand for most spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially BlackRock’s IBIT. “So, this was really the first time you had institutions be able to go on Wall Street and trade directly in crypto,” Garlinghouse explained . Capital that previously couldn’t enter the cryptocurrency space, such as endowment, pension funds, or even mutual funds, now has a dozen options to do so. Institutionalizing the Industry The second reason complements the first, Garlinghouse noted, as it simply changes the focus in the cryptocurrency industry, at least for the bigger projects, mostly on larger investors and institutions. As mentioned above, BlackRock’s IBIT broke multiple records in terms of net inflows for its year and a half in existence. “It should be no surprise that a Bitcoin ETF was the fastest ETF ever to get to $1 billion in assets.” It has become a behemoth as its total holdings are double that of the rest of the Bitcoin ETFs combined. As of Friday’s close, BlackRock’s BTC ETF had almost $48 billion in AUM as it continues to dominate the net inflows. IBIT has not seen a single day in the red since the market-wide crashes in early April. Consequently, Garlinghouse predicted that it will eventually close in on the gold ETFs as well. In terms of a spot Ripple ETF, the news from the SEC is somewhat expected as the agency continues to delay making a decision on a couple of filings. Polymarket shows that the chances of an XRP ETF hitting the US markets this year stand at well over 80%, but the percentage drops to 21% when the deadline is set at July 31. Nevertheless, Ripple saw some success on the ETF front as a few futures-based funds went live for trading in the past month or so.

2025-05-25T14:14:29.000Z,"Where Do Crypto Casinos Excel Over Normal Ones?","The gaming industry has witnessed a gigantic transformation with the introduction and spread of crypto casinos, which have created a huge global presence. In 2025, the global crypto casino industry hit $81.4 billion in revenue, beating traditional gambling in some crucial aspects, such as speed of transactions and accessibility to users. In Canada, where gambling has long been a blend of regulated land-based establishments and online, crypto casinos are gaining popularity for their new features, and some of the old guard are getting on board by accepting crypto payments. This piece looks at the ways in which crypto casinos are superior to their traditional equivalents, with particular reference to Canada's changing gambling landscape. Speed and Efficiency of Transactions Cryptocasinos have introduced the standard for the speed at which players can deposit and withdraw funds. In contrast to traditional casinos, which use bank transfers or credit card deposits that could take days, crypto takes mere seconds. In Canada, players are allowed to deposit in Ethereum or Bitcoin and play in a matter of minutes. Withdrawals, being able to take seven days in the traditional setups due to banking delays, are normally taken in hours with crypto. This ease appeals to Canadians who value quickness, especially in an industry where offshore destinations dominate the bulk of sites due to the absence of local online options. Transparency of the blockchain also ensures secure, provable payments, eliminating the hassle of payment contests. But that is not to say that traditional online casinos don’t enjoy a popularity of their own, both due to familiarity and the ease of using traditional banking methods for deposit and payout, while the processing times don’t matter much. Another thing that retains player loyalty and attracts new ones, particularly in Canada, is bonuses like the ones on the Canada Casino Bonuses list, which covers an extensive selection of casinos, and a tactic more and more crypto casinos have adopted for promotion. Enhanced Privacy and Anonymity Crypto casinos score very high in terms of privacy. Traditional casinos require vast amounts of personal information in a bid to meet anti-money laundering laws. Crypto casinos, on the other hand, usually allow players to gamble with little personal data, using only a wallet address. Such anonymity will be attractive to players who prefer anonymity, particularly on offshore platforms operating in the grey market. While traditional casinos are bound by strict Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, crypto casinos tread the line between compliance and anonymity for players, offering a compromise that resonates in an era where privacy is paramount. Innovative Bonuses and Promotions Crypto casinos lead mainstream competition with pushy, tailored bonuses aimed at the population that adopted crypto. Some operators provide a match deposit bonus of up to 400% and free spins, a rate that few mainstream operators offer. These rewards are designed to be attractive to crypto users, leveraging cryptocurrencies' lower cost per transaction to offer more rewards. In Canada, where some casinos have started accepting payments in cryptocurrency, traditional casinos are integrating retro loyalty programs with crypto-appealing rewards, such as instant cashback rewards in Bitcoin. However, crypto casinos lead the charge by incorporating blockchain-based rewards like tokenized loyalty points that bricks-and-mortar casinos can't keep up with due to their reliance on centralized systems. Global Access and Market Presence Crypto casinos break down geographical barriers that encumber traditional casinos. In Canada, while provinces like Alberta legalized online gambling for private operators, crypto sites thrive by catering to players across borders without the currency conversion hassles. Old-fashioned brick-and-mortar casinos, even those that have an online extension, tend to be rooted in local banking systems and currency controls. The borderless nature of crypto ensures that players can easily join international sites with stablecoins or big cryptocurrencies. Such convenience has fueled the industry's $81.4 billion revenue, as crypto casinos poach players from jurisdictions where conventional gambling is hampered by regulation or practical difficulties. Blending the Best of Both Worlds Some Canadian old-school casinos are weathering the crypto storm without overhauling their model. They’ve done it by adding crypto payments alongside traditional means like Interac and credit cards. These sites offer familiarity with brand names along with the benefit of crypto's speed and security. Nevertheless, they are based on traditional forms, physical location, or old infrastructures that limit them in embracing pure blockchain technology innovation, like provably fair games or NFT incentives. Crypto casinos, however, are built from scratch for cryptocurrency, giving them a head start in technology incorporation and adaptability. Challenges and the Way Forward As quick, as private, and as innovative as crypto casinos are, they are subject to regulatory scrutiny in Canada. Ontario's bid to regulate offshore gambling advertisements and Alberta's move to bring the online markets under regulation are signs of tighter monitoring. Traditional casinos have established trust and regulatory clarity, something crypto sites are still working through. Yet the $81.4 billion crypto betting market does not ease up, driven by sites that prioritize user experience and technological prowess. As Canada’s gambling scene keeps evolving, crypto casinos are likely to keep pushing boundaries, while traditional operators adapt selectively to stay competitive.

2025-05-25T14:10:51.000Z,"Pakistan Allocates 2,000 Megawatts for Bitcoin Mining and AI Centers","Pakistan is making a bold move toward embracing digital innovation by allocating 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity specifically for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The initiative is part of a national digital transformation plan led by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local broadcaster 24NewsHD TV Channel. In the initial phase, the government will divert excess power toward building AI infrastructure and crypto mining facilities. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that the strategy could attract billions of dollars in foreign investment and create thousands of high-tech jobs across the country. To ensure sustainable development, the second phase of the initiative will incorporate renewable energy sources into the mining process, aiming to minimize environmental impact while boosting Pakistan’s role in the global digital economy . Tax Incentives and Regulatory Reforms The government is also rolling out a comprehensive package of financial incentives to draw interest from global tech investors. These include tax breaks for AI centers and import duty exemptions for Bitcoin miners. As a result, international companies have already begun visiting Pakistan to explore potential partnerships. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, hailed the announcement as a “turning point” for the country’s digital economy. Saqib has been a vocal proponent of using the country’s excess electricity for crypto mining and first introduced the idea during the Council’s inaugural meeting on March 21. The meeting included top officials such as the State Bank of Pakistan’s governor, the SECP chairman, and the federal IT secretary. In a further show of support, the country’s Ministry of Finance endorsed the establishment of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) on May 21. The PDAA will regulate blockchain-related financial infrastructure, including exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, and tokenized platforms. It will also oversee the monetization of surplus electricity through regulated Bitcoin mining and help startups scale blockchain-based solutions. Pakistan Eyes Leading Role in Digital Finance Pakistan’s recent efforts to formalize its crypto sector align with its strong performance on the global stage. The country ranked ninth in Chainalysis’ 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index, driven primarily by high retail participation. According to Statista, the number of crypto users in Pakistan is projected to surpass 27 million by 2025, highlighting the sector’s rapid growth in a population of 247 million. With infrastructure, incentives, and regulation all moving into place, Pakistan appears poised to become a major hub in the digital asset and AI landscape.

According to the company, after the recent price increase, Short-Term Investors (STH) stopped saving and started distributing their coins. According to Alphractal, the decline in STH supply historically indicates that Bitcoin is approaching major cycle peaks. As the price rises, slowing demand and increasing selling pressure are classic signs of a bull market approaching its end. Currently, the STH Realized Price is at $94,500. This level is considered the last support point for short-term investors before they lose again. On the other hand, the Realized Price of Long-Term Investors (LTH) has reached $33,000 and continues to rise. Related News: Solana (SOL) Makes a Weekend Announcement: New Feature Revealed Alphractal also shared an interesting onchain observation: “Whenever the STH Realized Price broke above the LTH Realized Price, it signaled the start of a new bull market.” Alphractal reminds us that despite the selling tendency of short-term investors, Bitcoin was able to reach all-time highs in a similar environment in 2021. However, according to the company, current macro onchain signals and symmetry in the halving cycle indicate that a significant market correction may begin after October 2025. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Chart of the Week: Bitcoin Soars, But ‘Wen Lambo’ Crowd Is Missing From the Rally","What happens when retail logs off from crypto and Wall Street tunes in? Looking at bitcoin's BTC recent all-time-high, one would say it feels bullish and the industry is maturing. That might as well be the case, but we might not be there yet. So before we floor our Lambos, let's look under the hood. First things first, retail investors have basically ghosted this rally. A quick search on Google Trends using the keyword \""bitcoin\"" shows that the surge that was seen back in 2021's bull market is non-existent. Back then, everyone and their grandmothers were Googling bitcoin, aping into altcoins and flooding the social media with rocket emojis. In 2025? It's a ghost town in retail-land. There was a blip of high retail interest surrounding the U.S. presidential election, when a short-lived memecoin mania took over retail sentiment. However, that surge is long gone, as memecoin prices tanked swiftly, even as bitcoin hit an all-time high this week, ripping past $111,000. \""Early in this cycle, memecoins became a concentration of risky retail-driven trading with related trading peaking in January,\"" said Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial. \""However, since then, there has been a virtual wash-out of interest and memecoin trading activity,\"" which shows \""the tepid risk appetite in crypto at the moment,\"" FRNT added. Translation: \""Wen Lambo\"" crowd got burned, and they aren't rushing back into the race track en masse anytime soon. From Lambos to Corollas On the topic of risk appetite, let's go back to the car analogy. During the 2021 bull market, people bought unreliable performance cars, stripped out the brakes and seatbelts to go faster than ever before, and did not care that there might be engine blowouts. As long as there was a promise of reaching the moon, bullish vibes were all that mattered. Now? After losing tremendous amounts of money on those unsustainable go-fast cars for years, traders are driving Toyota Corollas—sensible sedans that are slow but steady and still on the road. That risk-off sentiment is also evident from the funding rates, according to FRNT's analysis of BTC perp rates—a measure of how much traders are willing to pay to maintain their long positions. When bitcoin reached a record high of around $42,000 in January 2021, the perp rate was about blistering 185%. Today, at bitcoin near $110,000, the rate is near 20% on crypto options exchange Deribit, meaning the risk appetite isn't completely gone but nowhere near the 2021 frenzy. ATH jitters A third point to add is the high number of short positions in the market. As CoinDesk's Oliver Knight reported this week , the bitcoin long/short ratio is at its lowest point since the crypto winter in September 2022. This implies that the majority of the traders aren't completely buying into this recent positive momentum and betting on bitcoin moving lower as a hedge for the new bullish rally. The impact of such positioning was clear on Friday, when bitcoin swiftly crashed from near $111,000 to $108,000 in a matter of minutes and then bounced right back up to $109,000. The anxiety of a swift volatility is real. So in a car-themed analogy, the drivers (in this case, investors) are still taking out their super-modified, unreliable sports cars for a weekend drive on the track. Still, they also have their Corollas following along. Just in case the engine blows on their go-fast cars. Cautious optimism Given the current macro-risk, it's not entirely surprising that investors are on their toes and risk-averse. But this might just be exactly what your mechanic at the shop prescribed. In fact, this might be an indicator of a sustainable rally in the long term. \""Periods of low leverage and risk appetite in crypto have often preceded further sustainable gains,\"" according to FRNT . \""BTC appears to be in such a phase, set against a backdrop of numerous bullish catalysts and narratives,\"" the firm added. The bottom line is that the retail Lambos might have been towed away, but big money is stepping in with their everlasting Toyotas. This might start a slow but steady race to the moon, not just a reckless joyride.

2025-05-25T13:43:45.000Z,"Sui Coin Investors Pivot to Bitcoin Solaris: Nova App Mobile Mining Creates Smartphone Millionaires Overnight","Sui, launched as a high-performance Layer 1 protocol with strong backing, gained rapid interest in 2023 and early 2024. With its Move-based programming model and focus on scalability, Sui appealed to developers building DeFi and dApps. However, as the network matured, retail participation in SUI became largely passive. Without built-in staking rewards for small holders or mechanisms for earning from network activity directly, many early users began seeking opportunities with more accessible and consistent value distribution. That pivot is now leading many to Bitcoin Solaris, a protocol built from the ground up to reward users through mobile mining. Unlike token price speculation or validator staking, Bitcoin Solaris allows anyone with a smartphone to earn BTC-S tokens daily via the upcoming Nova App. The system’s structure has started to redefine participation — not just by making crypto accessible, but by delivering real income to everyday users. Nova App Turns Any Smartphone into a Reward-Generating Device Bitcoin Solaris uses the Nova App to decentralize token distribution. Users allocate a small amount of device storage (1–5 GB) and idle CPU to the app, which operates in the background — usually during charging or idle times. In return, BTC-S tokens are issued automatically based on device uptime and activity. There’s no validator complexity, no staking lockup, and no requirement to time the market. Mobile mining returns the control of earnings to the user, creating a system where participation equals reward. This model has already drawn attention from Sui investors who found themselves holding tokens with limited protocol engagement options. Bitcoin Solaris Scales Rewards Without Centralization Behind Nova App mining is a dual-layer blockchain designed for decentralized throughput. The Base Layer secures the chain using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC). The Solaris Layer handles execution using Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) — enabling 10,000+ transactions per second and 2-second finality. This layered design means that as more users adopt mobile mining, the system can scale without delays or congestion. It also ensures that reward distribution remains fast, fair, and decentralized — unlike traditional staking networks where control often consolidates around early validators or large token holders. Audited and Verified Infrastructure Builds Investor Confidence Bitcoin Solaris has completed full third-party validation to ensure smart contract logic, emission rules, and mobile mining architecture function as designed. The Cyberscope audit confirmed the integrity of its contracts, while the Freshcoins audit tested the system’s mobile scalability. The team has also completed KYC verification , bringing transparency to project leadership and governance. These verifications position Bitcoin Solaris as a compliant and secure protocol with fully disclosed rules — essential for a network promising decentralized daily income. Strategic Entry Point With 5x Return Potential Bitcoin Solaris is now in Presale Phase 4, with BTC-S priced at 4 USDT. The launch price is set at 20 USDT, offering early participants a projected 5X return before the Nova App mining platform activates publicly. Out of the fixed 21 million BTC-S supply, 4.2 million tokens (20%) are allocated to presale buyers. This stage offers more than discounted access. It gives buyers first positioning ahead of the public launch, where mining difficulty will rise as the network scales. The ability to enter before this transition mirrors the advantage held by early Bitcoin participants — before mining competition reduced individual returns. In a recent video, Crypto Nitro compared the passive holding model behind Sui to the active earning structure of Bitcoin Solaris. He outlined how Nova App mining gives users direct rewards without technical friction — and why mobile-first participation is driving renewed investor attention. Sui brought early innovation to smart contract performance — but left many retail users without direct earning tools. Bitcoin Solaris changes that by delivering protocol rewards straight to smartphones, offering real, decentralized income through mobile mining. Now in Presale Phase 4 at 4 USDT, BTC-S gives early participants access to token appreciation and network mining before difficulty and demand scale. For those seeking more than passive price exposure, the system is already in place — and the window is still open.

2025-05-25T13:32:50.000Z,"Best Altcoins to Buy Now – Meme, AI, and Real-World Use Case Picks","As the crypto market pushes past $3.1 trillion in May 2025, investors are shifting their focus. The days of chasing only Bitcoin or Ethereum are fading. Now, it’s about identifying the best altcoins to buy now—the projects with practical use cases, meme momentum, or cutting-edge tech like AI. One standout this month is Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , a token that blends artificial intelligence with meme culture to deliver both entertainment and real-world value. Alongside it, lesser-known but high-potential picks like Golem and Highstreet are gaining momentum. The right altcoins can offer massive upside. And unlike BTC or ETH, micro-cap altcoins allow you to get in early, with lower capital and higher growth ceilings. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) – Meme Power Meets AI Precision If you’re scanning for the best altcoins to buy now, Dawgz AI stands out with a unique blend of meme culture and real-world functionality. Built on Ethereum, $DAGZ is an altcoin designed to be more than just fun. It delivers value through: AI-powered trading algorithms developed by seasoned Wall Street traders Staking rewards that incentivize long-term holders Community engagement through contests and governance Security-first design, with a full audit from SolidProof (June 2024) Tokenomics Snapshot: 30% allocated to presale 20% to staking rewards 15% to community incentives Total supply: 8.89 billion tokens Current price: $0.004 (next tier: $0.00438) What makes Dawgz AI one of the best altcoins to buy is its combination of meme virality with real AI-driven utility. The project allows users to participate in governance, stake for returns, and benefit from AI tools that react to market trends in real time. As of May 2025, over $3.57 million has already been raised in the presale. That momentum—and growing investor confidence—positions $DAGZ at the front of this year’s crypto wave. Golem (GLM) – Altcoin Infrastructure for Decentralized Computing Not all top altcoins are memes. Some, like Golem (GLM) , focus on core blockchain infrastructure. Golem allows users to rent out unused computing power for complex tasks like AI training, 3D rendering, and simulations. Market Cap: $5.28 billion Use Case: Decentralized computation Real-World Adoption: Thousands of daily tasks processed GLM tokens are used to reward node operators and facilitate transactions within the network. You can find Golem on major exchanges like Binance, Upbit, and Coinbase, making it accessible for any investor looking for altcoins to buy with actual function. While technical complexity and competition from cloud giants remain hurdles, Golem’s decentralized approach is attracting developers and Web3 enthusiasts alike. If you’re seeking altcoins with high utility in the AI and data sectors, this one deserves attention. Highstreet (HIGH) – Where Metaverse and Commerce Collide Highstreet (HIGH) is a metaverse-focused altcoin that brings VR, NFTs, and e-commerce together under one immersive platform. It allows users to buy, trade, and own digital assets across a decentralized world. Market Cap: ~$48.8 million Focus: Virtual real estate, gaming, and branded NFT marketplaces Listed On: Binance, Coinbase, and more The HIGH token powers governance, staking, and transactions within the ecosystem. The project is backed by partnerships with real-world brands and blockchain platforms, which enhances its credibility in a still-developing market. While the metaverse hype cooled in 2024, projects like Highstreet continue to build—positioning themselves for the next wave of adoption. If metaverse projects rebound, HIGH could be a hidden gem among the best altcoins to buy now. Why Micro-Cap Altcoins Matter in 2025 Big gains rarely come from big caps. That’s why micro-cap altcoins are attracting so much attention. Unlike Bitcoin , which needs billions in capital to shift its price, smaller tokens like $DAGZ or HIGH can move significantly on far less volume. That’s how some projects delivered 100x+ in past cycles. But not all altcoins are created equal. Liquidity risks, rug pulls, and unstable teams are real threats. That’s why research matters. So what are the best ways to identify the best altcoins to buy now? Key Factors for Choosing the Best Altcoins to Buy Now Here’s what smart investors are watching in 2025: 1. Real-World Utility Tokens like Dawgz AI offer AI-driven features; Golem provides decentralized compute power; and Highstreet connects commerce with digital ownership. These are actual use cases—not just hype. 2. Tokenomics Look at supply, emissions, and staking potential. Dawgz AI’s 30% presale allocation and 20% staking rewards promote stability and engagement. 3. Market Trends With Bitcoin hitting $109K in March, investors expect capital to rotate into altcoins during this bull cycle. BTC may lead the charge, but altcoins often outperform it as sentiment spreads. 4. Exchange Listings Liquidity matters. All three tokens here—DAGZ, GLM, and HIGH—are (or are planned to be) tradable across leading platforms, improving access for new crypto investors. Why These Are the Best Altcoins to Buy Now Each of the three projects offers something different—but together, they show the spectrum of what’s possible in 2025. Dawgz AI brings utility to memes and builds a sticky user base through AI and staking. Golem powers the back-end of Web3, enabling decentralized applications to function at scale. Highstreet merges commerce and gaming into one virtual economy with growing brand buy-in. Whether you’re into speculative AI tools, decentralized infrastructure, or the metaverse, these represent some of the top altcoin bets for long-term growth. Final Thoughts: What Are the Best Altcoins to Buy Now? The next stage of the crypto bull run is already building. And if past cycles are any guide, the best altcoins to buy now won’t stay under the radar for long. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) delivers meme appeal, real AI tools, and secure staking. Golem (GLM) enables decentralized compute for Web3 and AI tasks. Highstreet (HIGH) bridges virtual shopping with gaming through the metaverse. These are more than tokens—they’re ecosystems with built-in incentives and clear growth paths. And as the market evolves, micro-cap altcoins like these could outpace both Bitcoin and legacy altcoins. FAQs Section Which altcoin is best to buy now? Dawgz AI stands out in 2025 for its combination of AI-driven trading tools and meme-driven community growth—offering both function and fun. What are the top 10 altcoins today? Among trending altcoins: Dawgz AI, Golem, Highstreet, Cardano, XRP, and Solana are drawing strong attention for innovation and market fit. Which coin has 1000x potential? Micro-cap altcoins like Dawgz AI offer high-risk, high-reward upside. With a sub-penny price and real-world utility, $DAGZ is one to watch. Which crypto will hit $1? Many low-priced altcoins aim to hit $1, but tokens with strong fundamentals, like Dawgz AI and Golem, are better positioned to approach that milestone.

2025-05-25T13:31:48.000Z,"With BTC set to hit a new ATH, MUTM is the perfect project to bet on","On May 21, 2025, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged 0.64% to a new record of over $107K per coin. Various factors have converged to push up the price of Bitcoin (BTC), including macroeconomic tailwinds, massive ETF inflows, and corporate purchases. Amid this bullish momentum, it might be the perfect time to capitalize on projects that could offer more bang for your investment, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect buy Rarely do projects so complete in their development, and conceptualization as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appear in the crypto sector. The project covers all existing pain points that face current DeFi projects, while also introducing new and innovative features that could revolutionize DeFi for the better. One of its standout features is the dual lending mode, which incorporates both P2P and P2C. Under P2P (Peer-to-Peer), lenders can lend tokens with low liquidity, such as meme coins like DOGE. This mode allows lenders and borrowers to engage in direct negotiations, where they can set the loan duration, interest rate, and partial fills. The upside is that lenders could potentially access higher yields while helping to boost protocol participation. The other mode is P2C (Peer-to-Contract), where assets are deposited in pools governed by audited smart contracts. For instance, a user can opt to deposit $800 worth of ETH in one of these pools. They will then receive annual percentage yields based on the pool’s utilization. Borrowers can take over-collateralized loans from these pools, whose interest rate rises as utilization rises. Over time, the rising rates discourage borrowing, while encouraging more lenders to sign up. The result is that it creates a self-stabilizing loop of capital efficiency. When lenders use the P2C mode, they get mtTokens in exchange for their assets. These tokens represent both the interest and principal amount. The tokens can also be used as collateral for borrowing assets, and can be traded on secondary markets since they conform to the ERC-20 token standard. Both modes are governed by smart contracts whose security has been verified via comprehensive audits. The entire ecosystem is on the verge of going live, with the presale phase of the tokens currently in phase 5. At the current time, all tokens are going for $0.03 per token, with plans to increase the price to $0.035 in phase 6. In short, everyone could be part of this revolutionary ecosystem at the low entry point of just 3 cents. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) dtablecoin To further bolster the attractiveness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the team behind this innovative project plans to launch a decentralized stablecoin. One standout feature of this stablecoin is that it will be powered by multi-asset collateralization. Traditionally, DeFi systems create stablecoins backed by single-asset vaults. In these vaults, each collateral type exists in a silo. For Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a basket of assets will be used to mint stablecoins. This will be a pre-approved list of assets that can be used as consolidated collateral. Since multiple assets can back one borrowing position, it will ensure the value of the stablecoin is backed by a diverse asset base. For stablecoin users, the borrowing process will be simplified, and easy to navigate. They will supply collateral to the protocol, and use it to borrow the stablecoin. It helps to boost flexibility, when it comes to managing price movements. When debt is backed by an array of assets, it can allow them to top up their assets without having to close a position. This will create the gold standard for decentralized stablecoins, further helping to cement the position of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) within the greater DeFi ecosystem. This is your chance to capitalize momentum During periods of upward price movement, the crypto sector attracts a lot of capital, as more people pay attention to the sector. It often leads to a renewed interest in new utility-based projects that show promise. By getting into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now, while the price is at a low $0.03, you can benefit from the coming surge in interest in MUTM tokens and triple or quadruple your potential payout. With MUTM tokens, the future of finance could be part of your future too. Thus far, over $9,2 million has made its way into the presale, which is a fraction of the potential capital influx that will enter the crypto markets in the coming weeks. With the team feverishly working to list MUTM on as many public exchanges as possible, this could be the perfect vehicle to ride the BTC bull run wave.

2025-05-25T13:30:53.000Z,"Ethereum Forms Inverse H&S – Bulls Eye Breakout Above $2,700 Level","Ethereum is trading around $2,500 after failing to reclaim the $2,700 level during the week. Despite the rejection, market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with many analysts viewing the recent pullback as part of a healthy consolidation phase. After weeks of volatile swings, ETH appears to be stabilizing above key support levels, potentially setting the stage for a stronger breakout in the weeks ahead. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical outlook suggesting that Ethereum may be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the 12-hour chart—a classic bullish reversal signal. According to Pillows, this structure could act as a springboard for ETH to retest and potentially break above the $2,700 level. For now, ETH’s ability to hold the $2,500 zone is a positive sign, as bulls look to defend key support and build momentum. If the pattern confirms, the next leg higher could unfold quickly. However, failure to hold current levels would likely invite renewed selling pressure. As the market awaits further confirmation, Ethereum’s technical setup continues attracting attention from traders eyeing the next move. Ethereum Needs To Lead To Confirm Altseason While many analysts continue to call for an incoming altseason, most agree on one key requirement: Ethereum must reclaim higher levels above $3,000 to lead the charge. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ETH historically acts as the gateway for broader altcoin rallies. Without its participation, the likelihood of a full-scale altseason remains low. Currently, Ethereum is trading near $2,500, consolidating after a failed attempt to break through the $2,700 resistance zone earlier in the week. Despite this rejection, optimism remains high. Analysts like Ted Pillows believe ETH is simply setting the stage for a larger breakout. In his latest analysis , Pillows highlights a developing inverse head and shoulders pattern on the 12-hour chart—an established bullish structure often preceding trend reversals. According to Pillows, a breakout above the $2,700 neckline would be a strong technical confirmation, likely triggering a rapid move toward the $3,000 level. “If ETH closes above $2,700 with momentum, it won’t take long to reach $3,000,” he noted. Many also believe Ethereum’s explosive move could come shortly after Bitcoin finishes its impulsive push above all-time highs. Once BTC cools down, capital may rotate into ETH and large-cap altcoins, fueling a new leg higher across the board. Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Ethereum is currently trading at $2,512 on the 4-hour chart after failing to break through the $2,700 resistance earlier in the week. The chart shows ETH consolidating between $2,470 and $2,700, forming what appears to be the right shoulder of a developing inverse head and shoulders pattern—a potential bullish reversal setup that traders are watching closely. The 34 EMA (green) sits at $2,557, and ETH is now trading just below it, signaling short-term weakness. However, the 100 SMA (purple) at $2,511 is offering immediate support, and bulls will need to defend this level to avoid a deeper correction toward the 200 SMA, currently near $2,156. Volume has declined during the recent pullback, suggesting that selling pressure may be losing steam. As long as ETH holds above $2,470 and avoids a breakdown below the neckline of the pattern, the setup remains valid. A confirmed breakout above $2,700 would likely trigger a quick move toward the psychological $3,000 level. The next few sessions will be crucial. Ethereum needs to reclaim the 34 EMA and gain momentum above $2,600 to confirm strength. Otherwise, a failure to hold support could delay the anticipated breakout and stall altseason hopes.

2025-05-25T13:30:53.000Z,"Moving Apple iPhone Manufacturing to US a ‘Pinocchio Story,’ Says Investor Dan Ives – Here’s What He Means","Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, believes it’s unrealistic for Apple to move iPhone production onshore, despite the White House agenda to bring manufacturing home. In a new CNBC interview, the investor points out that Apple has made a smart move by creating a manufacturing base in India to diversify its supply chain and reduce reliance on China. But with President Trump threatening to slap 25% tariffs on iPhones manufactured outside the US, Ives says Apple investors are now in a tough spot because he doesn’t think it’s feasible for the tech giant to uproot its global supply chain. “It’s a Pinocchio story – the reality of actually having iPhone production in the US. Because in my opinion, that will take four to five years, $20 to $30 billion, even to move 15% to 20% of the supply chain. And then if you actually produce the iPhone in the US, you’d be looking at $3,500 iPhones. So I view it as Apple’s situation, they tried to pivot around India and that was a smart strategy and now their backs are against the wall. It was a Twilight Zone day today for any Apple investor, given Apple has done all the right things in terms of pivoting out of China and now [they’re] saying come to the US – that’s a fairy tale.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:30:50.000Z,"XRP Big Gun Buys $300,000 Watch with XRP, Says It’s Instant and Cheap","In a bold showcase of XRP’s real-world utility, prominent XRP advocate Edo Farina recently revealed on X that a luxury watch worth $300,000 was purchased with XRP. Farina, well-known in the XRP community for his relentless promotion of the asset’s capabilities, emphasized that the transaction was not only instant but also remarkably cheap, positioning XRP miles ahead of competitors like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) when it comes to payments at this scale. This revelation has renewed excitement among the XRP community and the broader crypto ecosystem. As blockchain networks continue to battle for dominance in the payments space, Farina’s post underscores what many XRP enthusiasts have long claimed: XRP’s superior speed and cost-effectiveness make it a natural fit for high-value transactions. Paying for a $300k watch with $XRP Instant. Cheap. No way BTC or ETH could handle that. pic.twitter.com/3mAjdix1oe — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 25, 2025 XRP’s Edge Over Bitcoin and Ethereum in Payments While Bitcoin and Ethereum are the largest and most recognized cryptocurrencies globally, they often face criticism for their high transaction costs and slower settlement speeds, especially under heavy network load. Bitcoin’s ‘digital gold’ status notwithstanding, it processes an average of 7 transactions per second (TPS) with confirmation times varying from 10 minutes to over an hour due to network congestion and fees. Ethereum fares slightly better with 15–30 TPS but still struggles with scaling issues and fluctuating gas fees that can soar during peak activity. XRP, on the other hand, was specifically designed for fast , cheap, and scalable cross-border payments. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) can handle 1,500 transactions per second, with settlement times as fast as 3-5 seconds and fees as low as fractions of a cent. These features make it uniquely positioned to handle micropayments and large-value transactions, such as the $300,000 luxury watch purchase highlighted by Farina. The Importance of Real-World Use Cases The crypto industry has long faced criticism for its limited practical applications beyond speculation and investment. High-profile use cases like this luxury watch purchase prove that payments are maturing beyond the hype. According to Farina, the XRP transaction was smooth, efficient, and cost-effective, a testament to the asset’s power in real commerce. This kind of adoption is crucial as Ripple, the company closely tied to XRP, continues to expand its network of financial partners and payment corridors globally. Ripple’s institutional focus notwithstanding, high-net-worth individuals also use XRP for personal transactions, capitalizing on its speed and efficiency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Competitive Landscape for Crypto Payments The race to become the dominant cryptocurrency for payments is intensifying, with new solutions like Ethereum’s layer-2 networks (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network aiming to overcome native limitations. However, XRP’s advantage lies in its readiness: it requires no additional layers, upgrades, or workarounds to deliver instant, low-cost payments. This makes it highly appealing for merchants and buyers who want frictionless transactions without worrying about technical complexity. Moreover, XRP’s resilience has been notable despite its regulatory battles in the U.S., particularly the lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which partly dampened its institutional momentum. Yet, the XRP community, led by figures like Farina, has remained unwavering in promoting its strengths, often highlighting its unique technical design, longstanding market presence, and growing international adoption. The Road Ahead for XRP Payments The growing number of high-value transactions, like the $300,000 watch purchase, showcases XRP’s real-world potential. It’s not just about theoretical advantages or whitepaper promises; it’s about actual, verifiable transactions that deliver on the vision of cryptocurrency as a better medium of exchange. While the crypto space continues to innovate, the core metrics of speed, cost, and scalability remain pivotal. With industry veterans like Edo Farina championing XRP’s use for significant, high-value purchases, the asset solidifies its reputation as a payment-focused crypto ready for mainstream adoption. As the ecosystem advances, XRP’s unique blend of technological efficiency and practical usability positions it for continued leadership in digital payments.

In fact, fresh market data from May 2025 points toward growing investor appetite for crypto presales—especially those tied to strong platforms with transparent blockchain infrastructure and passive reward mechanics. Let’s explore the top crypto presales to watch this year, including a meme-infused AI project ( Dawgz AI ) that’s quickly climbing the radar. Why Altcoins and Crypto Presales Are Taking Over in 2025 The crypto market is shifting. According to TradingView, Bitcoin ’s dominance dropped from 65% to 62% in just one week—breaking a five-month uptrend. Meanwhile, total crypto market cap jumped from $2.90 trillion to $3.24 trillion, signaling investor rotation into altcoins. Joao Wedson, an analyst tracking 57 mid-cap tokens, reports that 37 outperformed Bitcoin over the last 60 days. His takeaway? The altcoin season isn’t coming—it’s already started. This pivot presents a unique opportunity for investors focused on the best crypto presale to buy in 2025. As capital flows from major coins into emerging projects, early entries may see the biggest returns. What Makes the Best Crypto Presale to Buy Right Now? To identify the best crypto presale to buy, investors are watching a few key criteria: Security-first platforms: Smart contracts should be audited to prevent common exploits. Utility beyond hype: Projects need more than memes—they need real-world value. Tokenomics designed for growth: Balanced allocation across staking, liquidity, and rewards. Community engagement: The best crypto presales know how to build hype the right way. These factors separate the serious contenders from the rest—and few current presale tokens tick more boxes than Dawgz AI. Dawgz AI – Best Crypto Presale to Buy in 2025? Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is gaining traction for blending meme coin culture with algorithmic AI trading tools. It’s Ethereum-based, security-audited, and community-first—a rare combo that’s turning heads in the crypto presale 2025 cycle. Why Dawgz AI Stands Out: AI-powered trading system developed by Wall Street experts. Staking rewards activate just seven days after presale purchase. Audited smart contracts ( SolidProof , June 2024) for peace of mind. Presale price: Just $0.004, with nearly $3.6M already raised. Multichain access: Accepts ETH, USDT, BNB, and SOL for broad adoption. With 30% of its 8.88 billion token supply reserved for presale, Dawgz AI delivers low entry with high upside. And thanks to community contests, meme campaigns, and active Telegram groups, engagement is climbing fast. It’s not just another meme coin—it’s one of the most strategic crypto presales currently live. That’s what puts it at the top of the list for anyone searching for the best crypto presale to buy right now. Cardano (ADA) – The Research-Backed Giant With Ongoing Upgrades While not a presale token, Cardano (ADA) continues to rank among the most solid altcoin options. It’s research-driven, governed by peer-reviewed upgrades, and maintains a loyal developer community. Why ADA Could Still Explode: Hydra upgrade promises better scalability. A growing DeFi ecosystem is taking shape on Cardano’s Plutus smart contracts. Price remains affordable for retail investors at $0.733 (as of writing). With its focus on academic rigour and blockchain security, ADA may not be flashy—but it’s still one of the safest bets if Bitcoin enters a correction. XRP – A Sleeping Giant With Regulatory Clarity Once bogged down by an SEC lawsuit, XRP is staging a comeback. Now that Ripple’s court case is mostly resolved, the door is open for institutional adoption of its payment infrastructure. Why XRP is Back on Radar: RippleNet partnerships with major banks are expanding globally. ETF rumors are swirling—adding fuel to the fire. At $2.36 (as of May 2025), it’s already bouncing from its 2024 lows. If you're scanning for the best crypto to buy now beyond presales, XRP is a proven name with room to run. Positioning for the Next Altcoin Wave According to Wedson, “most altcoins have already bottomed.” He suggests looking beyond Bitcoin’s short-term movements and focusing on presale-stage projects that combine real innovation with active communities. Dawgz AI fits that description—and it’s available now. Because the platform supports ETH, USDT, BNB, and SOL purchases, entry is seamless for most investors. Plus, its blackbox AI tool doesn’t just sit idle—it continuously scans crypto markets, placing automated trades designed to outperform human behavior. What Makes Dawgz AI the Best Crypto Presale to Buy? Let’s break it down: Security: Full audit by SolidProof Utility: AI-powered tools + staking rewards Community: “Dawgz Army” meme contests, user growth Tokenomics: Fair allocations with incentives for long-term holding Presale Momentum: Nearly $3.6M raised and climbing It’s also worth noting that the platform itself promotes long-term growth. With AI utilities baked into the system, early investors aren’t just betting on hype—they’re investing in a token designed to adapt to market conditions. If you're building a diversified portfolio in 2025, this might be the one crypto presale you don’t want to miss. The Best Crypto Presale to Buy Before Altcoin Season Peaks As Bitcoin loses dominance and capital rotates into smaller names, crypto presales are becoming the new launchpad for explosive gains. The key is to act before sentiment shifts too far. Dawgz AI offers AI functionality and security that few presales match. Cardano and XRP continue to lead in institutional credibility and ecosystem strength. With staking rewards and audited contracts, $DAGZ positions itself at the top of any serious crypto investor’s list. So what’s the move? If you're looking for the best crypto presale to buy before altcoins truly take off, Dawgz AI might just be your smartest play in 2025. FAQs Section What is the most successful crypto presale? Tokens like Ethereum and Solana had legendary crypto presales—but in 2025, Dawgz AI is gaining momentum with its AI utility and secure ecosystem. Which crypto is the next to explode? Altcoins like Dawgz AI, ADA, and XRP show strong potential due to tech upgrades, community momentum, and wider adoption. What is the next 1000x crypto? While no gains are guaranteed, low-cap crypto presales like Dawgz AI, with proven tokenomics and early investor support, have high upside. Which crypto coin will boom next? Investors suggest looking at crypto presales with strong fundamentals. Dawgz AI, backed by AI tools and a presale price of $0.004, is one to watch.

2025-05-25T13:25:02.000Z,"If Bitcoin hits $150K, experts say MUTM will ride to $5: here’s why","The crypto market is once again buzzing with bullish momentum, and all eyes are on Bitcoin. With speculation growing around a potential rally that could push Bitcoin to $150,000, investors are looking beyond BTC for projects that could experience even greater percentage gains. One such project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol that experts believe could soar to $5 if the crypto tide turns in Bitcoin’s favor. Why Bitcoin at $150K changes the game for DeFi Historically, when Bitcoin enters a strong bull run, it doesn’t rise alone. In 2021, as Bitcoin surged from $10K to nearly $70K, it ignited an explosive wave across decentralized finance (DeFi). Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols ballooned from under $1 billion to more than $250 billion. Lending and borrowing platforms were at the heart of this surge, driven by growing demand for liquidity and leveraged opportunities. Mutuum Finance is built to thrive in these conditions. As a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that facilitates lending and borrowing, it is positioned to attract liquidity from both retail and institutional players. When markets rise, users prefer borrowing instead of selling their appreciated assets, fueling borrowing demand. This in turn benefits lenders, who earn higher yields—creating a self-sustaining cycle of capital flow. Why MUTM at $0.03 looks like a rare opportunity At its current price of $0.03, MUTM presents a case that’s hard to ignore. With over 504 million tokens already sold and more than 10,900 holders on board, the project has already established a significant early footprint. Mutuum is currently in Phase 5 of its presale, raising over $9.1 million in total. Importantly, the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform around the token’s public release—a sign of serious commitment to delivering functionality, not just hype. For early investors, the math becomes exciting when applying compounding logic. If MUTM reaches $5, that would represent a 16,566% gain from its current price. A $1,000 investment at $0.03 would grow to approximately $166,666. Such growth is not unprecedented. In 2021, similar DeFi tokens like AAVE and COMP saw meteoric rises in response to the DeFi explosion. The belief that MUTM could repeat this trajectory is not far-fetched—especially if Bitcoin triggers a new TVL wave. Understanding MUTM’s role in the ecosystem MUTM isn’t just a speculative asset. It serves as a critical part of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem. Holders benefit in several ways, particularly from the protocol’s dividend mechanism. A portion of Mutuum’s revenue will be used to buy MUTM from the open market, and those tokens will be distributed to users who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This model incentivizes long-term participation and aligns rewards with the platform’s success. Moreover, as the platform gains more users, both borrowing and lending activities are expected to scale, increasing revenue—and thus the value and utility of MUTM. Token holders who actively stake their assets will be in line to receive a consistent stream of dividends, turning MUTM into a passive income-generating asset in addition to its appreciation potential. The roadmap is more than just promises Another reason for optimism is Mutuum’s commitment to delivery. The beta launch scheduled near the token’s go-live date demonstrates a product-first approach. Unlike many projects that launch tokens without a working product, Mutuum is aiming to ensure that functionality is available from day one. This builds trust in the protocol and encourages adoption. To further drive awareness and community growth, the team is currently running a $100K giveaway campaign. This move not only rewards early supporters but also helps attract new participants to the ecosystem, increasing visibility just as the broader market sentiment starts to shift. While there are many lending protocols in the DeFi space, Mutuum takes a hybrid approach by offering both pool-based and peer-to-peer (P2P) borrowing options. This gives users the flexibility to choose between automated liquidity models and custom lending agreements, catering to a wider range of investor preferences. Its dynamic interest rate model ensures that capital remains efficiently utilized. When borrowing demand is high, rates rise to protect lender incentives. Conversely, during low demand periods, borrowing becomes more attractive—helping maintain balance within the liquidity pools. For both lenders and borrowers, this adaptive system ensures a fair and competitive environment. A realistic road to $5 for MUTM The $5 target may seem ambitious at first glance, but historical data and current market conditions suggest it’s within reach. If Bitcoin hits $150K, and if DeFi again draws billions in liquidity, protocols with strong fundamentals like Mutuum stand to benefit the most. MUTM doesn’t need to capture the entire market to see explosive growth—it only needs to capture attention, volume, and steady user adoption. Given the $0.03 starting point, even moderate adoption could push MUTM into the $1–$2 range. But with the right mix of rising TVL, consistent dividend payouts, and a functioning platform at launch, $5 becomes a reasonable projection for those entering early. For investors seeking a high-upside play with tangible utility, a committed team, and a market environment that may soon turn wildly bullish, Mutuum Finance looks like a name to remember.

The suspect, 37-year-old John Woeltz, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest the previous day. According to police, Woeltz, along with an unidentified accomplice, held the victim captive for weeks inside a rented luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly costing $30,000 per month. The victim had arrived in the United States on May 6, and authorities believe he was abducted shortly afterward. Once inside the residence, the attackers allegedly stole the victim’s passport and electronic devices before demanding access to his Bitcoin wallet. When he refused to share his credentials, he was reportedly subjected to horrific abuse. The victim told police he was beaten, electrocuted, assaulted with a firearm, and even dangled from the upper floors of the five-story property. Graphic Abuse and Escape In a particularly disturbing detail, the victim claimed Woeltz used a saw to cut into his leg and forced him to smoke crack cocaine. The attackers also reportedly threatened the victim’s family. Photographs found at the property, including Polaroids showing visible injuries, appear to support the victim’s account. The man eventually managed to escape on Friday and contacted authorities, leading to Woeltz’s arrest. Woeltz has been charged with four felony counts, including kidnapping for ransom. He pleaded not guilty and was denied bail by Judge Eric Schumacher. He is scheduled to return to court on May 28. A 24-year-old woman was also detained in connection with the incident. However, she was seen walking freely the next day, and no formal charges against her appear in court records. Authorities have not yet revealed whether any crypto was successfully stolen or the nature of the relationship between the parties involved. Rising Security Concerns Among Crypto Figures This incident adds to a growing list of violent crimes targeting individuals involved in cryptocurrency. Amid rising wealth and limited regulation, crypto executives are increasingly turning to private security firms . Amsterdam-based Infinite Risks International reported a noticeable uptick in bodyguard requests from crypto investors, particularly in France. Authorities there have ramped up protections following several high-profile abductions , including that of Ledger co-founder David Balland in January 2025. As digital assets become more valuable, law enforcement and security agencies around the world are grappling with the new risks tied to holding and managing crypto.

2025-05-25T13:00:03.000Z,"Bitcoin Upward Trend ‘Fragile’ As Spot Market Volume Drops — A Cause For Alarm?","Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has displayed strong bullish momentum, breaking through several resistance levels to reclaim six-figure valuation and forge a new all-time high. After breaching its previous all-time-high price, the premier cryptocurrency has rekindled positive sentiments regarding its growth across the cryptocurrency market. As BTC continues to grow, however, recent on-chain data suggests that investors may need to check their optimism and approach the market with caution. Futures Surge, Spot Falls — Binance Data Signals Need For Caution In a May 24 post on social media platform X, on-chain analyst Darkfost reported that trader activity in the Bitcoin futures market on Binance has slightly increased since May 5, while the spot market activity has dwindled considerably. Related Reading: Technical Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Blow Off Top To $325,000 – The Timeline Will Shock You This on-chain observation is based on two metrics: the Daily Binance Future Trade Volume and the Trading Volume on Futures and Spot. As their names suggest, these metrics track the trading volume across various markets on the world’s largest exchange. When the Future Trading Volume metric has a high value, it typically suggests a growing appetite for short-term bets on BTC. On the other hand, a low value implies less willingness of futures traders to bet on Bitcoin’s movement in the short term. For the spot market, a high value on the metric mirrors investors’ inclination towards long-term bets on Bitcoin. Meanwhile, a low value often indicates that investors suggest reduced faith in the long-term promise of the flagship cryptocurrency. According to data shared by Darkfost, the increase in futures activity, combined with the decrease in spot market activity, has created an imbalance in market dynamics. This current imbalance hints at a rise in speculative trading, meaning investors are now more motivated by risk-on sentiment, rather than long-term belief in the cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, this inclination to place bets on BTC’s short-term movement can heighten volatility, especially when these bets are not backed by strong spot demand to support the trend. “This increase in risk-taking on the market makes the trend more fragile and calls for heightened caution before making investment decisions,” Darkfost ended with a warning note. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $107,770, reflecting a 0.2% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by over 4% in the past seven days.

2025-05-25T12:45:11.000Z,"Is This the Month to Back Qubetics, Cosmos, and Filecoin as the Best Cryptos to Invest in Today Amid Bitcoin’s Climb","Is Bitcoin’s explosive run to $111,000 reshaping the crypto outlook for 2025? In a wave of optimism not seen in months, Bitcoin recently surged past the $111K mark—powered by institutional support and the spotlight of U.S. political endorsement ahead of the anticipated crypto-focused dinner with Donald Trump. This renewed energy is stirring bullish sentiment across the market, sparking interest not only in top-tier coins but also in developing blockchain projects that promise real-world impact. Among those capturing attention right now is Qubetics ($TICS), a blockchain framework that’s pushing the limits of interoperability while reshaping developer access through its suite of integrated tools. Qubetics isn’t just part of the current conversation—it’s shaping it. This platform introduces simplified tools for blockchain development that solve some of the sector’s most persistent challenges. Where older frameworks struggled with accessibility and cross-chain functionality, Qubetics steps in with solutions like QubeQode and a drag-and-drop IDE that opens blockchain creation to a much broader range of users. Meanwhile, Cosmos continues to spark interest with its interoperability drive, while Filecoin is navigating a recalibrated valuation with eyes still fixed on its decentralized storage relevance. As momentum builds across the sector, these three projects stand out for their practical use cases, technical strategies, and positioning among the best cryptos to invest in today. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE: Bridging Blockchain Gaps Qubetics is pioneering solutions that tackle real-world challenges in blockchain development. Its QubeQode platform and Qubetics IDE are designed to simplify the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) by providing user-friendly interfaces and robust tools. These applications enable developers to build and deploy smart contracts more efficiently, fostering a more accessible and interoperable blockchain ecosystem.

Pakistan allocates 2,000MW power for Bitcoin mining and AI centers Pakistan has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity exclusively for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers. The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel. In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country. The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility. Crypto ETFs won’t lose ‘their luster’ as wallet adoption grows — Cathie Wood ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely maintain their place in the economy no matter how big crypto wallet adoption becomes over the next decade. “I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23. “So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Bitbo data suggests that there are around 200 million active Bitcoin wallets worldwide. Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs , coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.

2025-05-25T12:36:42.000Z,"XRP the Next Bitcoin? — Analysts Envision 2,700% Rocket to $45 XRP Price Based on Crazy Historic Patterns","The cryptocurrency community is abuzz with renewed optimism for XRP . Leading influencers and analysts predict a substantial price surge, comparing the digital asset to Bitcoin in its early days. Time Traveller, a prominent XRP advocate with over 10,000 followers on Twitter, recently shared a compelling message highlighting XRP’s potential upside. “Some of you think that your small bag of XRP will be nothing major in the future, but allow me to explain something to you,” he tweeted . Using Bitcoin’s historic price trajectory as a benchmark, the pundit pointed out that Bitcoin’s lowest recorded closing price was just $0.05 on July 18, 2010. Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin is trading at approximately $107,382 at press time, a staggering increase that highlights its meteoric rise. To put this into perspective, a mere $0.01 investment back then would have bought 0.2 BTC. At today’s price, that small investment would now be worth roughly $21,476. He concluded that XRP trading under $100, especially below $5, is akin to buying Bitcoin at its infancy, signaling significant future gains. Echoing this bullish sentiment, The Bearable Bull, a self-proclaimed millionaire mentor and crypto influencer, predicted on Friday that XRP’s price could reach $8, marking the “end of the generational wealth journey.” After years of anonymity, The Bearable Bull recently amplified this message, signaling a confident new chapter for XRP investors. Adding to the chorus of optimism is analyst Egrag ccrypto, who has made bold forecasts based on technical analysis and historical patterns. Egrag predicted XRP could surge by as much as 2,700%, reaching $45, or experience a more moderate rise of 1,050% to $19. He bases these predictions on XRP’s previous bull cycles in 2017 and 2021, where the asset saw gains of 2,772% and 1,052%, respectively. “Men lie, women lie, but charts don’t!” Egrag tweeted, emphasizing the power of historical trends in predicting future movements. He noted that key technical indicators like the 21 EMA and 33 MA have historically preceded XRP’s significant breakouts after periods of consolidation lasting around 770 days. According to Egrag, XRP’s current rally, which began in late 2024 and saw its price increase nearly sixfold, could be the start of another major bull phase. Despite the optimism, cautionary voices remain. Market analyst Koroush AK recently advised traders to consider shorting XRP, warning of bearish momentum and a possible price drop to $1.30. Similarly, analyst Cole Garner and trader Crashius Clay have expressed bearish views, with Clay disclosing a $1 million short position on XRP due to concerns about overvaluation and weakening demand.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-the-next-bitcoin-analysts-envision-2700-rocket-to-45-xrp-price-based-on-crazy-historic-patterns/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin. Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion . However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy. At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines. “Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.” El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs , World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion. “This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said. When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs. The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.” World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: World Evin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance. Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand network A pattern of tech overreach? El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information. He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress. “The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.” In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children. In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement. ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi Fatic World, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs. The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center. However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned. Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023 , with governments like Germany , Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data. In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5. Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb Mini The risk of digital exclusion As biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality. “When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.” World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data. There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors. World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data. The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking. “We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.” Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in US The need for secure identity systems The urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring. “Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities. “This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.

In a new Bloomberg survey involving 20 market strategists, both JPMorgan and Citi predict that the Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) will outperform the S&P 500 for the remainder of 2025, driven by an improving economic outlook in the EU. Among the polled analysts, JPMorgan has the highest target for SXXP, predicting that the Stoxx Europe 600 Index will soar to a high of 580 points in the coming months. At the same time, the bank forecasts a decline for the S&P 500. Meanwhile, Citi expects SXXP to surge to 570 points this year as the market gets more clarity on corporate earnings. Says Citigroup strategist Beata Manthey, “If we have already moved past peak earnings uncertainty, this could set the stage for additional upside and potential multiple re-rating, especially among more beaten-up cyclical sectors.” The SXXP is a stock market index that tracks the performance of the 600 largest publicly traded firms across 17 European nations. As of Friday’s close, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index is trading at 545 points, up about 7.60% year-to-date. The banks’ outlook comes as Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) warns that the S&P 500 is rallying without pricing in the potential negative impacts of tariffs, reports Yahoo! Finance. In an investor note, EY chief economist Gregory Daco says that tariffs will likely pressure household demand by driving prices up. He also expects the US economy to lose momentum and approach “stall speed” in the fourth quarter of 2025, forecasting a year-over-year GDP growth of just 0.6%. “Equity markets have reacted with unwarranted optimism, overlooking the persistent economic drag posed by elevated tariffs.” As of Friday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,802 points.

Speaking during a surprise AMA Saturday, Hoskinson laid out a series of bold initiatives that he believes could reshape the Cardano ecosystem and the broader crypto and technology landscape. One of the standout revelations was his plan to develop a virtual city powered by AI agents that simulate real-world human behavior in a crypto economy. According to the pundit, this digital metropolis, inspired by the Altera project, will be used to test economic policies, regulatory interactions, DeFi integrations, and the scalability of blockchain-based systems in a live yet controlled environment. He described it as a place to beta-test stablecoins, model interactions between regulators and malicious actors, and move beyond the traditional TPS metric toward a more nuanced measure he called “concurrent cities.” “It would be a really cool exercise to run a virtual city. You can stop thinking of TPS and you can start thinking your your DeFi ecosystem as cities run concurrently.” He stated . “ Many cities can run concurrently comfortably in this meaning that there’s no disruption to the commerce inside the system.” Hoskinson also gave an update on Midnight, Cardano’s upcoming privacy-centric blockchain. Notably, with a focus on sectors like healthcare, Midnight will feature private stablecoins and trustless bridges to Cardano, allowing seamless and secure asset transfers. He emphasized that the native token for Midnight will launch with what he claims is the fairest and decentralized distribution model in crypto history. “It’s the most decentralized launch in the history of the cryptocurrency space. I am very proud of it. It’s a new distribution model. I think you guys are all going to like it.” He stated. Looking toward Bitcoin integration, Hoskinson teased an infrastructure project called BitVMX, timed ahead of the Bitcoin 2025 conference. He said the initiative will connect Bitcoin’s liquidity to Cardano ’s ecosystem using Hydra-powered fast finality and lending protocols that offer native Bitcoin yield. He also suggested a future where Bitcoin Ordinals are integrated with Cardano’s NFT infrastructure, enhancing both networks. Moreover, Hoskinson expressed frustration with the current decentralized structure’s inability to make timely decisions on governance. He called for a hybrid model, introducing an executive function complementing the community’s voice. He also preemptively addressed the forthcoming audit on Cardano’s early token distribution, dismissing online allegations of misconduct as politically motivated gaslighting.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-unveils-ambitious-vision-for-cardano-ai-and-privacy/,"ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson",cryptocompare

2025-05-25T12:07:36.000Z,"Senator Gerard Rennick Sparks Outrage by Calling Bitcoin a “Ponzi Scheme”","Australian Senator Gerard Rennick has stirred controversy in the cryptocurrency world after labeling Bitcoin a “Ponzi scheme” and questioning its practical value because “you can’t eat it.” His comments came in a May 23 post on X, following a user’s query about his stance on Bitcoin after it reached an all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. “Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why? Because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply-constrained product,” Rennick said in his post. He added, “What exactly will this product produce? Absolutely nothing,” arguing that Bitcoin has no tangible output and suggesting Australia needs “real engineers, not financial engineers.” His remarks quickly drew sharp criticism from the global BTC community. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) issued a formal response, stating Rennick’s opinions reflected a “deep misunderstanding” of Bitcoin’s fundamentals. “This matters, because misunderstanding leads to misrepresentation. And misrepresentation leads to bad policy,” the ABIB emphasized. Bitcoin Advocates Defend the Asset Bitcoin supporters were quick to defend the cryptocurrency and counter Rennick’s claims. Laura Shin, host of the Unchained podcast, sarcastically noted , “You also can’t eat the internet, so do you oppose that too?” Others, like Bitcoin Marathon team lead Jimmy Kostro, suggested Rennick’s take would not age well, asking him to elaborate on his views with more depth. Despite the pushback, Rennick doubled down, brushing off the criticism. “It’s pathetic how the BTC community needs reassurance from a politician — the very people they claim they want to be free from,” he responded. He also insisted he didn’t need to “explain anything.” The clash reflects a growing pattern of tension between traditional policymakers and digital asset advocates. Bitcoiners frequently call out public figures who oppose or misunderstand the technology. Not the First Clash Just weeks before Rennick’s remarks, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs faced backlash from the crypto community for vetoing a bill that would have allowed the state to include Bitcoin in its official reserves . Jameson Lopp, co-founder of Casa and noted cypherpunk, said her decision would “age poorly.” Likewise, the U.S. government faced heavy criticism from the BTC community in December 2024 for transferring $1.9 billion worth of Bitcoin to Coinbase, a move many saw as a missed opportunity for sovereign crypto adoption. For many the community, such government moves and statements only reinforce their belief in the need for decentralized financial systems.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.Source: Mario NawfalRelated: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsCrypto victim beaten, electroshockedThe victim described being beaten, shocked with electricity, assaulted with a firearm and even dangled from the upper floors of the five-story building.He also told police that Woeltz used a saw to cut his leg and forced him to smoke crack cocaine. Threats were also reportedly made against his family.Photographic evidence found inside the property, including Polaroids, appears to support claims of sustained abuse. The victim managed to escape on Friday and alert authorities, leading to Woeltz’s arrest.Woeltz was charged with four felony counts, including kidnapping for ransom, and entered a plea of not guilty. Judge Eric Schumacher ordered him to be held without bail. He is expected back in court on May 28.A 24-year-old woman was also taken into custody on Friday in connection with the incident. However, she was seen walking freely in New York the next day, and no charges against her were found in the court’s online database.Authorities have yet to clarify the relationship between the suspect and the victim or whether any cryptocurrency was ultimately stolen.Related: Crypto crime goes industrial as gangs launch coins, launder billions — UNCrypto executives turn to bodyguardsExecutives and investors in the crypto industry are increasingly seeking personal security services as kidnapping and ransom cases surge, especially in France.On May 18, Amsterdam-based private firm Infinite Risks International reported a rise in requests for bodyguards and long-term protection contracts from high-profile figures in the space.French authorities have responded by introducing enhanced protections for crypto entrepreneurs and their families, including security briefings and priority access to police assistance.This comes amid a recent surge in kidnappings and ransom attempts.

Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs have seen approximately $2.77 billion in inflows since launching in July 2024.Wood said that spot Ether ETFs were “less successful than people were expecting” because the US Securities and Exchange Commission did not allow staking. On May 21, the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund.However, Wood still views Ether as the entry point for new investors to familiarize themselves with smart contracts before exploring other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL). “So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” Wood said.Related: ‘We are worried about a recession,’ but there’s a silver lining — Cathie WoodWood said that the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), in January on the Solana network may have caused investors to be skeptical of Solana.“Institutions and you’re saying 60-year-olds…I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” Wood said. Just days after its launch on Jan. 17, TRUMP slid around 50% after the president made no crypto-related “day one” executive orders.“I mean, that might scare them,” Wood said.

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material chargesEisenberg charged with child pornographyIn a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico.

The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership.

Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization.

The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections.   Related: Ukraine strategic Bitcoin reserve bill reportedly in final stagesOn May 6, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte was the first to sign a Bitcoin reserve bill into law. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs later approved a law allowing the state to claim ownership of unclaimed crypto.

2025-05-23T20:00:00.000Z,"Crypto Biz: From shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar to shorting the US dollar","When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo.Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructureBanco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily.SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services.Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik.Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claimsAmerica’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell.In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets. At the time of its launch, the YLDS stablecoin offered a yield of 3.85%.Pi Protocol and Spark Protocol have also developed interest-bearing tokens. Source: Austin CampbellStrategy continues to stack satsWith Bitcoin back above $100,000, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm, Strategy, has resumed its buying spree by acquiring 7,390 BTC last week for approximately $765 million.The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, with an unrealized gain of around $20 billion.The announcement came just two days before Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time high, climbing above $109,000 for the first time since January.

Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.”May 22 letter to DOJ official calling for investigation into Trump memecoin dinner.

That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:52:03.000Z,"Who attended Trump’s controversial memecoin dinner?","The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.However, some attendees spoke to the press or took to social media to talk about the dinner. Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why?

Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit.

With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice?

Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.

2025-05-23T08:47:40.000Z,"DeFi near-zero onboarding costs can help 1.4B unbanked: 1inch co-founder","Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have a major cost advantage over traditional banks when it comes to onboarding new users, according to Anton Bukov, co-founder of decentralized exchange (DEX) 1inch.Speaking at a panel during Dutch Blockchain Week on May 22 in Amsterdam, Bukov said traditional banks spend between $100 and $300 per user to verify documents and set up accounts. Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.On May 20, the US Senate voted 66-32 in favor of advancing discussion on the stablecoin-regulating Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The bill outlines a regulatory framework for stablecoin collateralization and mandates compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. The bill is now headed to debate on the Senate floor.Earlier this week, White House crypto czar David Sacks said he expects the bill will be passed and that it will receive bipartisan support.However, high-ranking Democrats plan to amend the bill to include a clause prohibiting President Donald Trump and other US officials from profiting from stablecoins.Trump and his family launched the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, which created the USD1 stablecoin in March.

It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices.Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.Total Bitcoin futures OI. Source: CoinglassWhen OI surges, it indicates massive leveraged positions are built up in the market, with lots of traders holding large positions with borrowed money. If Bitcoin’s price moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated, and the flushout can create selling pressure on Bitcoin, which can cause a rapid drop in prices and high volatility.However, analysts suggest the surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which have seen more than $2.5 billion this week, can counter some of that extended leverage.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s MersingerBitcoin options markets show a similar pattern with open interest over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The Sui Foundation also confirmed:\""A large number of validators identified the addresses with the stolen funds and are ignoring transactions on those addresses until further notice. The Cetus team is exploring paths to recover those funds and return them to the community.\""The Cetus hack is the latest in a string of such incidents impacting crypto and Web3 in the first half of 2025.

2025-05-22T18:43:00.000Z,"OpenAI plans to ship 100 million pocket-sized AI devices for everyday use","OpenAI is planning to develop AI “companion” devices that will integrate artificial intelligence capabilities with everyday life, potentially opening the door to a new high-tech innovation used alongside laptops and smartphones.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he and designer Jony Ive are developing these secret devices for mass consumption, with plans to ship 100 million units upon launch.Ives joined OpenAI after his startup, io, was acquired by Altman’s company in a $6.5 billion deal, the Journal reported on May 21. Neither Altman nor Ives specified what these companion devices would look like or how they would operate. Ives simply referred to them as a “new design movement” that would be similar to Apple’s family of hardware and software integrations. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from investors, who view the company as a stalwart in the AI industry following the overwhelming success of its ChatGPT large language model (LLM). As of May, ChatGPT had nearly 800 million weekly active users, according to industry data. These usage trends were behind OpenAI’s massive $157 billion valuation as of October 2024 — a figure that nearly doubled to $300 billion by March 2025.ChatGPT usage trends.

It’s unclear whether the new social media platform would launch as a standalone product or be incorporated into ChatGPT.The blend between AI and social media has also bled into the blockchain industry, with several startups utilizing these technologies to build AI agents, LLM tools and decentralized social media networks.As Cointelegraph reported, Validation Cloud recently deployed an LLM on the Hedera network, giving decentralized finance users the ability to query blockchain data more easily. Related: OpenAI’s Altman appears to reject Musk’s $97.4B bid for control",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/openai-100-million-pocket-sized-ai-devices-everyday-use?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-22T18:41:59.000Z,"Solana price fractal targets rally to $260, but one thing must happen first — Analysts","Key takeaways:Solana’s bull flag pattern projects a rally to $260, but low spot buy volumes have analysts advising caution.After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.Solana 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated. The support range is a daily order block, which should provide higher time frame (HTF) support in case of a price correction. Related: Bitcoin could go much higher due to lack of FOMO and futures market euphoria — AnalystsSolana price fractal aims for $260Crypto trader Robert Mercer shared a chart identifying a price fractal pattern similar to October 2024. Mercer emphasized two critical zones: one around late 2024, where SOL broke past $180 after consolidation, and a current zone mirroring that setup. He predicts a breakout above $180 could trigger a sharp upward rally, mirroring the late 2024 rally that saw $SOL peak near $260.Solana price fractal analysis.

Marks suggested that if this pattern breaks out again in 2025, Solana could reach a price target of $450.Popular crypto trader XO also remained on the lookout for a long opportunity, but suggested waiting to see if Solana could flip the $180 level into support.
