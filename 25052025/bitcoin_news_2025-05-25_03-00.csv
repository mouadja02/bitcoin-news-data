2025-05-25T00:30:46.000Z,"Singaporean Crypto Investors Boost XRP Holdings To 17%, Report Finds","Singapore’s crypto crowd is shifting its focus beyond Bitcoin. Interest in XRP has climbed as more traders add the token to their portfolios. The change comes even as Bitcoin remains the top holding. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Crypto Awareness At Record High According to the 2025 Independent Reserve Crypto Index for Singapore, 94% of locals are familiar with at least one cryptocurrency. That’s a big jump from previous years. Bitcoin still leads the pack—91% know it by name. And it makes up 68% of the average investor’s crypto stash. Yet the fact that almost everyone can name a digital coin shows that Singapore’s trading scene is maturing. Singaporean Investors are increasing their XRP holdings.👇 https://t.co/ydq9PGwmXj pic.twitter.com/aK9H85ZVwb — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 22, 2025 XRP Ownership On The Rise Based on reports from Milieu Insight Market Research, XRP saw one of the strongest gains among altcoins. It now represents 17% of crypto holdings in Singapore, up from 14% last year. Ethereum grew even more, climbing from 41% to 48%. Solana ticked up from 17% to 19%, while Dogecoin rose only 1 point, from 18% to 19%. Still, XRP’s 3-point boost hints at growing trust in its payment-focused design. Monthly Investments Varied Widely Investors in Singapore are not all spending the same amount each month. About 57% put in less than $500. Another 29% contribute between $500 and $1,000. Only 10% dedicate more than $1,000 each month to steadier “dollar-cost averaging.” Those figures suggest that most people treat crypto as a side play rather than a full-time career. Stablecoin Trends And RLUSD Stablecoins are also part of the mix. Roughly 46% of respondents said they own—or once owned—these US-pegged assets. Of that group, 21% hold them now, while 25% have moved on. Eighty-three percent prefer USD-pegged coins. In that context, Ripple’s new RLUSD has reached a $310 million market cap in just a few months. Ripple’s APAC managing director, Fiona Murray, said the coin is not just for trading but also for cross-border payments and DeFi work.

A Bitso report found that Latin American buyers favored XRP over Ethereum and Solana in 2024. With XRP adoption growing both regionally and in APAC, its role could shift from an afterthought to a core part of retail and institutional strategies. For now, Bitcoin’s dominance remains solid. Still, altcoin allocations are climbing—and XRP is leading that charge.

Their analysis sheds more light on why altcoins are lagging despite the Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high (ATH) at $111,900. Why This Bull Market Is Different As Altcoins Lag Behind Bitcoin Price In an X post , Matrixport stated that many traders are missing out on the current Bitcoin price rally as traditional retail engagement indicators remain low despite the rally to a new ATH. The firm explained that this rally is happening thanks to institutional investors, with retail investors on the sidelines in this bull market . Matrixport noted that this explains why funding rates remain subdued, retail activity is low, and many altcoins continue to lag as the Bitcoin price rallies in this bull market. The firm also revealed that retail traders make the fundamental mistake of not anticipating market corrections, leading to them occasionally closing their positions during sharp drawdowns. This bull market also differs from 2021 in that retail’s share of Bitcoin ownership is no longer expanding. Crypto whales have stepped in and are absorbing most of the flagship crypto’s supply, kicking retail investors to the curb. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas once noted that this could explain why the Bitcoin price has held up well during major corrections. According to Matrixport, understanding how corporate demand influences the Bitcoin price behavior and how long this trend is likely to last is critical as the shift in this bull market progresses. Meanwhile, the absence of retail traders in this cycle explains why funding rates and trading volumes are relatively low, with altcoins lagging. The firm noted that market participants are witnessing a quiet transfer of Bitcoin from early adopters and investors, miners, and exchanges to corporations like Strategy and institutional investors like BlackRock. Matrixport again asserted that the current Bitcoin price rally is driven by spot market accumulation and not derivatives activity, which could explain why altcoins are lagging behind BTC. What Next For BTC And Altcoins In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the next important step is for the Bitcoin price to record a weekly close above $106,800 and then follow through or consolidate next week. He remarked that BTC is really the only thing that matters and urged market participants to take their eyes off altcoins. If the Bitcoin price fails to accomplish that goal, the analyst stated that market participants can then turn their attention to the reverse psychology 2021 fractals. It is worth mentioning that the analyst once predicted that altcoins led by Dogecoin will still have their run once BTC’s dominance cools off in the summer. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,258, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/altcoins-lag-behind-bitcoin/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Altcoins|altcoins|alts|bitcoin|Bitcoin dominance|BlackRock|Bloomberg|btc|Coinmarketcap|dogecoin|Eric Balchunas|Kevin Capital|Matrixport|Michael Strategy",cryptocompare

2025-05-24T23:30:36.000Z,"XRP Risks Fall To $1.55 If This Support Level Fails – Analyst","XRP prices have fallen 4.08% in the past day alongside the majority of the crypto market following the US announcement of a potential 50% tariff on goods being imported from the European Union (EU). Amid this market downturn, popular market analyst CasiTrades has stated that XRP lies in danger of a further decline should a particular support level fail. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger XRP Must Avoid Crash Below $2.25 – $2.26 As Bitcoin prices reached a new all-time high in the past week, XRP followed suit, reaching as high as $2.45 before experiencing a price rejection driven by negative macroeconomic pressure due to the new international tariffs by the US Government. In the day, XRP price notably declined by over 5% from $2.45 to $2.33 before finding some stability to enter a sideways movement as seen in the last few hours. According to CasiTrades, XRP’s rejection aligns with a 1:1 Fibonacci extension of the corrective C-wave pattern in the Elliott Wave Theory, signaling the possible exhaustion of the previous relief rally seen earlier in the week. Notably, the analyst warns that XRP’s decline may lead to a retest of “major structural support” at the $2.25 – $2.26 price zone, which aligns with the Fibonacci retracement level 0.382. CasiTrades explains that Fib 0.382 has represented a key technical price level over the past six months. Therefore, a price break below this level could trigger deeper corrections, forcing XRP’s price as low as $1.55 – $1.90, a price move that would wipe out all price gains that have been recorded since the crypto market uptrend resumed in early April. However, if the $2.25 – $2.26 support zone holds, such market resilience could trigger a new price rally to around $2.70 and beyond. Thereafter, XRP is likely to return to the local peak of the current bull run at $3.84. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buyers Regain Control – Spot CVD Flashes Bullish Shift Above $110,000 XRP Price Overview At the time of writing, XRP continues to trade at $2.33 following a 1.45% decline in the past week. However, the altcoin is up by 9.77% in the past month, reflecting that the majority of new market entrants are still in profit. In other positive news, Volatility shares launched an XRP futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 22.

Ethereum is steadily climbing, while Bitcoin’s robust rally above $111,000 is fueling optimism across the board. In this environment, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE and established assets such as XRP are emerging as top contenders for outsized gains—offering strategic entry points for those willing to act before major catalysts unfold.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as the breakout presale of 2025 , drawing unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. With over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearing completion, the project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are driving a surge in participation. Early backers can now use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus on token purchases, amplifying the opportunity for transformative gains. Analysts are projecting up to 10,500% upside, with some models even suggesting a $1 valuation by year-end if momentum continues. In a market hungry for innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader for early-stage returns. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Climb and Institutional Adoption Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades supporting its long-term outlook. The network’s recent Layer 2 expansion and anticipation of ETF approvals are fueling institutional interest, with analysts forecasting a potential move toward $4,000–$6,000 by late 2025. While Ethereum remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Price Resilience XRP is consolidating above $2.30, buoyed by regulatory clarity, CME futures speculation, and significant whale accumulation.

Crypto community sounds alarm about Ledger phishing letter scam Industry executives and crypto community members are raising the alarm about a new phishing scam in the form of physical letters sent to crypto holders made to look like communication from the Ledger hardware wallet company. The letter instructs recipients to \""validate\"" their wallets and provides a QR code that likely links to a malicious phishing site that steals private keys and other sensitive user data. A copy of the Ledger phishing letter. Source: Mike Belshe BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared a copy of the letter on X and confirmed that it was delivered via the United States Postal Service (USPS). The incident reflects the increasingly sophisticated and novel forms of phishing attempts and scams targeting the crypto community and serves as a reminder for crypto holders to take proactive safety measures to protect sensitive data from social engineering attempts. Judge overturns fraud convictions in Mango Markets exploit case A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets. On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets. The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case. Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform.

2025-05-24T22:00:52.000Z,"Cardano Nears $0.76 — MAGACOIN FINANCE Surges Ahead of Blue-Chips With 13,000% Growth Path","Introduction As the market prepares for the next phase of growth, timing is key in identifying breakout opportunities. Cardano is now inching toward $0.76, signaling renewed confidence among investors, but it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that is rewriting the playbook for early-stage success in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Unprecedented Presale Momentum and 13,000% Upside CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of the crypto community, with Stage 8 attracting record participation from both retail and institutional buyers. The project’s innovative tokenomics—a fixed supply, rigorous audits, and a compelling narrative—are setting a new benchmark for presale projects. Early backers can leverage the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus, amplifying the appeal for those seeking exponential gains. Analysts are now pointing to a potential 13,000% upside, fueled by robust on-chain activity and a rapidly expanding investor base. In a market hungry for innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the frontrunner for outsized early-stage returns . Cardano (ADA): Testing Resistance and Building Momentum Cardano is trading just shy of $0.76, with technical indicators hinting at a possible breakout if buying pressure persists. Recent developments in the ecosystem, including new DeFi integrations and partnerships, are bolstering sentiment. While ADA’s fundamentals remain solid, its growth trajectory is more gradual compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the pace for early-stage excitement. XRP: Institutional Interest and Price Resilience XRP is holding steady above $2.35, supported by ongoing regulatory progress and growing institutional interest. Market watchers are eyeing a potential move toward $2.85–$3.40 if bullish trends continue, with some forecasts even suggesting higher targets by year-end. Despite its strong position, XRP’s upside is outpaced by the dynamic growth and presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, making MAGA the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Institutional Backing Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto market, trading above $110,000 with strong institutional backing and ETF inflows. Analysts anticipate a potential push toward $115,000 if current momentum holds, but the scale of BTC’s market cap means its growth is now more measured. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a unique opportunity for investors to participate in a project still in its formative stages, with far greater upside potential. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Progress and Future Prospects Hedera is consolidating near $0.21, with technicals indicating a period of stability after recent gains. Analysts are optimistic about a move toward $0.25–$0.30 in the coming months, but the pace of growth is expected to be steady rather than explosive. For those seeking the next major breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader for high-growth early-stage investments. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Cardano’s approach to $0.76 and the steady performance of XRP, Bitcoin, and Hedera are noteworthy, but the spotlight is firmly on MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 13,000% growth path, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout opportunity of 2025.

2025-05-24T21:04:41.000Z,"Ethereum Stands out Post-Pectra Upgrade as Crypto Inflows Skyrocket to $785 Million","Ethereum closed last week on a remarkable note, as weekly inflows skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. Data from leading European alternative asset manager CoinShares revealed that inflows into Ethereum hit $205 million, marking a major increase from the previously reported $1.5 million. James Butterfill, a researcher at CoinShares , explained that the new development might be directly tied to Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade and the recent appointment of a new co-executive director as part of its leadership reshuffling process. “Ethereum was the standout performer, with US$205m in inflows last week and $575 million YTD, indicating renewed investor optimism following the successful Pectra upgrade and the appointment of new co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak,” The researcher wrote. Meanwhile, the broader cryptocurrency market saw inflows hit a staggering $785 million the previous week. The new metric, significantly topping outflows recorded earlier in the year, particularly between February and March, suggests that the market has been recovering steadily. Notably, year-to-date cryptocurrency inflows (YTD) have hit an impressive total of $7.5 billion. Despite the new figures marking a drop from last week’s total inflow of $882 million, the United States remarkably outperformed Hong Kong and Germany, which saw inflows totaling $24.2 million and $86.2 million, respectively. Acknowledging the mild decline in Bitcoin inflows recorded in the last week, CoinShare’s James Butterfill made the following assertion in the report: “Bitcoin attracted $557 million in inflows, a decrease from the prior week, likely due to continued hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Short-bitcoin products saw a fourth consecutive week of inflows, totaling $5.8 million, reflecting investor positioning amid recent price gains.” With last week’s development reflecting five consecutive weeks of positive inflows, it remains to be seen how much the positive sentiment can grow and how much the current trend could influence price action for Bitcoin and altcoins alike.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-stands-out-post-pectra-upgrade-as-crypto-inflows-skyrocket-to-785-million/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Ethereum|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T21:00:15.000Z,"Trump’s meme coin dinner called a disaster with terrible food and weak security","The $TRUMP token dropped by 7% on Saturday morning, hours after President Donald Trump hosted a black-tie gala at his Virginia golf club. The event was held for holders of his meme coin, who collectively spent $148 million just to attend. Guests were promised access, luxury, and a moment with Trump. What they got instead was bad food, weak security, and a brief fly-by appearance from the president himself. According to CNBC , it was a night that left many attendees frustrated — and some outright angry. Among the 220 people who showed up were crypto figures like Sandy Carter from Unstoppable Domains and former NBA star Lamar Odom, who used the occasion to promote his own token, $ODOM. Trump showed up, said a few words, and left in a helicopter without greeting most of the room. One guest, 25-year-old Nicholas Pinto, said , “He didn’t talk to any of the 220 guests — maybe the top 25.” Pinto added that he had nothing to drink besides Trump-branded wine or water. “I don’t drink, so I had water. My glass was only filled once,” he said. As for the food? “The food sucked,” he said plainly. Guests ignored, wallets tracked, and complaints everywhere The top 25 wallets were promised a special reception and tour. But others like Pinto — who was driven there in a Lamborghini by his dad — left unimpressed and hungry. Trump only stayed 23 minutes, gave a quick speech recycling old crypto lines, then flew off without taking pictures or answering any questions. Pinto noticed that phones were not locked in RFID pouches and said security became an afterthought once Trump was gone. “Once Trump left, they didn’t really worry about anything else,” he said. Inside the ballroom, guests flaunted money. “Richard Mille watches weren’t even rare,” Pinto said. “I saw at least 16 people wearing them.” But he said the energy was off. “Lots of people didn’t even hold the coin anymore. They were checking their phones during dinner to see if the price moved.” Outside the gates, about 100 protesters gathered. One of them was Senator Jeff Merkley, who showed up to support a new bill with Chuck Schumer. The bill — called the End Crypto Corruption Act — aims to stop presidents and high officials from profiting off crypto ventures while in office. Protesters held signs saying “Crypto Corruption” and “Trump is a traitor.” Inside the event, the #1 holder of the $TRUMP coin was Justin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto billionaire. Justin holds over $22 million in the $TRUMP token and $75 million in World Liberty Financial’s token. He’s currently facing SEC fraud charges, although the case has been paused. Justin didn’t seem worried though. “As the top holder of $TRUMP and proud supporter of President Trump, it was an honor to attend the Trump Gala Dinner,” he posted. “Thank you @POTUS for your unwavering support of our industry!” The chaos around the dinner added fuel to what’s becoming a mess on Capitol Hill. Representative French Hill, a Republican from Arkansas, said the Trump family’s involvement in meme coins is “making his work in Congress harder.” Hill is one of the lawmakers behind the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to finally regulate stablecoins. But now, with Trump’s name tied to controversial tokens, he says the gala was “a distraction from the good work we need to do.” The GENIUS Act now faces a serious risk. Senator Josh Hawley added a clause that would limit credit card late fees, which banks hate. It’s now being called a poison pill that could kill support for the whole thing. While the gala was happening, Senate Democrats said they would push for new rules blocking US presidents and top officials from profiting off crypto — a direct challenge to USD1, a stablecoin linked to Trump and launched this spring. If the bill collapses, the damage could go global. JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citi are reportedly in early discussions about building a US digital dollar. Their plan is to compete with Tether, which now dominates 60% of global crypto transactions. But those banks are waiting for legal clarity. If the GENIUS Act doesn’t pass, the US could lose momentum in the international crypto race. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-24T21:00:13.000Z,"Market Expert Projects ‘Undervalued’ Litecoin To Soar At Least 1,000% —  Here’s How","The price of Litecoin has been somewhat indecisive this year, and the past week is a prime example of this disappointing trend. While the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reached a new all-time high, LTC failed to capitalize on the injection of bullish momentum into the crypto market. However, a prominent crypto expert has come forward with a claim that Litecoin might be the most undervalued asset in the market at the moment. Interestingly, the altcoin’s price seems set to enjoy a period of strong bullish impetus over the next few months. Here’s Why LTC Price Could Be Set For An Extended Rally Chartered Market Technician Tony Severino has put forward an exciting prediction for the price trajectory of Litecoin in the coming months. According to the crypto expert, the digital asset could be preparing for an extended bull rally of at least 1,000% — and up to 2,000% — price growth. Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K This bullish projection is based on the movement of the Stochastic Oscillator on the 3-month LTC price chart. The Stochastic Oscillator is an indicator used in technical analysis to gauge price momentum and pinpoint potential trend reversals. The indicator is usually represented by two lines: %K and %D. %K is a faster line while %D is a smoothed moving average of %K, and they both oscillate between 0 and 100. When the Stochastic Oscillator falls below 20, it implies an oversold market; while values above 80 often indicate an overbought market. According to Severino, the Litecoin 3-month Stochastic is approaching the 50 mark, which signals rising bullish sentiment for the altcoin’s price. The indicator failed the last time it attempted to cross this level in 2021. However, the successful breach of this 50 mark is still historically significant, as it has marked the start of substantial bull rallies in the past. For instance, the altcoin’s price grew by 4,900% when the Litecoin Stochastic crossed the level in 2017. Severino noted that it is highly unlikely for the price of Litecoin to surge by nearly 5,000% from its current level if the Stochastic Oscillator crosses the 50 level. Nevertheless, the market expert believes the asset’s price could rise by at least 1,000% and up to 2,000% by the end of 2026. Finally, Severino mentioned that the Litecoin price is in an interesting place, with the asset being one of the most undervalued crypto assets at the moment. Litecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of LTC stands at around $96, reflecting an over 5% decline in the past 24 hours.

New documents show the Fed purchased $8.8 billion in 30-year bonds on May 8th via its System Open Market Account (SOMA) – a move that followed a $34.8 billion purchase earlier that same week. The move has triggered allegations that “stealth QE” has arrived, with a MarketWatch Op-Ed by Charlie Garcia calling the move “monetary policy on tiptoes.” The Fed has long stated such purchases are routine reinvestments of maturing securities to adjust the money supply and influence interest rates to meet its targets. The Fed’s buying spree follows a major Treasury sell-off from China. New numbers from the Treasury Department show China sold $18.9 billion in US bonds in March, while most other countries increased their holdings. China now holds $765.4 billion in US Treasuries and is in third place behind the UK and Japan, which hold $779 billion and $1.13 trillion, respectively.

2025-05-24T20:26:01.000Z,"Bitcoin inflows projected to reach $420B in 2026 — Bitwise","Key takeaways: Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027. Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence. Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026. In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026 ,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027. Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: Bitwise Despite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital. Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns. Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profit The bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocation In addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack. Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios. In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion. The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply. In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC. The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.

2025-05-24T20:20:25.000Z,"Expert Pinpoints People Who Will Miss Out When XRP Hits $10 to $1,000","A prominent voice in the XRP community has issued a cautionary message to skeptics, suggesting they may ultimately miss out on substantial returns if XRP achieves its long-term price targets. The statement comes as the token continues to trade within a narrow range despite broader market momentum. The commentator, known as BarriC, has developed a reputation for making bold predictions about XRP’s future. He has consistently argued that the token is capable of reaching price levels many consider unrealistic, including valuations between $10 and $1,000. His most recent remarks appear to address critics who believe such projections are implausible. $XRP has skyrocketed from $0.006 to $3 + in 2017-2018 That’s over 500x To make the assumption that #XRP could NEVER do another 500x at any point in the future To push this narrative that in the entirety of $XRP future in crypto, that it could never see any positive price… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) April 26, 2025 Skepticism Remains High Despite XRP’s Historical Gains BarriC’s comments come during continued market hesitation around XRP. Since reaching a peak of approximately $3.40 in January 2025, the asset has failed to maintain upward momentum, now fluctuating around the $2 mark for several months. This prolonged consolidation has led to growing doubts among investors, particularly as other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have reached new all-time highs. Despite this, BarriC maintains that doubting XRP’s potential is short-sighted. He points to XRP’s historic surge during the 2017 bull market, when the asset rose from roughly $0.006 to over $3, an increase of more than 500 times. He argues that this historical precedent supports the possibility of another substantial rally in the future, even if the timeline remains uncertain. According to BarriC, those dismissing XRP’s long-term outlook often ignore the asset’s fundamental strengths and past performance. He suggests that the same disbelief seen during Bitcoin’s early days is now being directed at XRP, and those who remain skeptical could find themselves excluded from future gains. Comparisons to Bitcoin’s Growth Trajectory BarriC has drawn parallels between XRP’s current situation and Bitcoin’s historical path. He highlights how Bitcoin was once written off when it traded for less than $1, only to reach heights above $110,000 years later. He believes XRP has similar potential and that past underperformance should not be used to dismiss future growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Critics, however, counter this narrative by pointing to XRP’s stagnant price over the past few years and its struggle to surpass its 2018 all-time high. Some argue that XRP’s larger circulating supply and different utility model present structural limitations that could prevent it from achieving extreme valuations. Diverging Views on Long-Term Price Targets BarriC is not alone in his optimism, although timelines for high-value targets vary among analysts. Changelly forecasts that XRP could reach $100 by August 2034 and potentially hit $1,000 by June 2040. Meanwhile, Telegaon projects a $100 valuation sometime between 2035 and 2040 but offers no estimate for reaching $1,000. Still, BarriC remains steadfast in his view that price levels from $10 to $1,000 are not only possible but inevitable over time. He contends that those who continue to spread doubt, what he categorizes as “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” (FUD), will be the ones who ultimately miss out if the token reaches the ambitious benchmarks he envisions.

2025-05-24T20:18:01.000Z,"US Tourist Drugged and Robbed in London: $123K in XRP, BTC Vanishes","A US software developer’s brief London layover turned into a nightmare after a suspected abduction and crypto theft left him physically injured and financially gutted. Jacob Irwin-Cline, 30, says he was drugged by a fake Uber driver in the early hours of May 9, who allegedly used coercive tactics and a spiked cigarette to steal access to Irwin-Cline’s crypto holdings. In the process, the victim was drained of a staggering $123,000 from his digital wallets. Drugged, Injured, and Robbed According to a report by MyLondon, the Portland native had stepped out for drinks at The Roxy nightclub in Soho and planned to return to his Bayswater hostel shortly after 1:30 AM. But after calling a legitimate Uber through the app, a man resembling the driver’s profile pulled up in a different vehicle, a dark sedan rather than the listed Toyota Prius. Lured by familiarity, Irwin-Cline accepted a cigarette from the driver, which he believes was laced with scopolamine, a drug known to render victims pliable and amnesic. What followed was a blur: Irwin-Cline recalled that he intermittently lost consciousness, during which he said to had handed over passcodes, and vaguely navigated through his apps before being ejected from the vehicle. He also said that the driver struck him during the abrupt escape. The attacker reportedly exploited Irwin-Cline’s Revolut app to access multiple crypto wallets and extracted roughly $72,000 in XRP, $50,000 in Bitcoin, and smaller altcoin amounts. The victim’s phone and laptop were both compromised – his laptop was remotely wiped, and his phone was stolen. Despite a desperate scramble to recover his accounts, aided by a flatmate back in the US, the digital assets were gone within hours. He said he was left barely able to walk and emotionally devastated. While he does not believe he was deliberately targeted, the attack mirrors rising cases across Europe involving so-called “wrench attacks,” where physical coercion is used to force crypto access. The Metropolitan Police and FBI cybercrime team are now investigating, but Irwin-Cline fears the odds of recovery are slim. Physical Attacks Escalate As the industry gains wider acceptance and popularity, there has been a worrying increase in physical assaults targeting individuals holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Earlier this month, a failed kidnapping attempt in Paris targeted the daughter and grandson of a prominent crypto executive. Masked attackers ambushed the family during a school drop-off but fled after the couple resisted, with one attacker’s gun later revealed to be a replica. The incident, caught on camera, adds to a string of violent crypto-related crimes in France. Victims were confirmed to be relatives of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat. Previous attacks include a kidnapped crypto millionaire’s father and a ransom assault on Ledger’s co-founder, both involving mutilation.

Chicago Fed leader Austan Goolsbee warns in a new interview with CNBC that Trump’s policy choices could also lead to an unfavorable economic environment known as stagflation, which is dominated by stagnant economic growth, high inflation and high unemployment. “In the short run, we have to just wait for the dust to come out of the air… Everything’s always on the table, but I feel like the bar, for me, is a little higher for action in any direction while we’re waiting to get some clarity. And then, over the longer run, if they’re putting in place tariffs that have a stagflationary impact, which is to say a slowed-down output by raising the cost of production, while also raising prices, then that’s the central bank’s worst situation.” Goolsbee says the Chicago Fed has been in conversations with business owners in their districts who say they’re hoping for policy consistency. “The CEO of a construction company said, for them, they’re now in a put-your-pencils-down moment where they just have to wait. If every week or every month or every day, there’s going to be a new major announcement, they just can’t take action until some of those things are resolved.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-24T20:00:24.000Z,"Here’s Why Token Velocity Could Be Behind Current XRP Price Lag","Despite moderate gains in recent weeks, XRP continues to underperform relative to other major cryptocurrencies, prompting renewed analysis from within the community. One prominent XRP-focused commentator has suggested that a key factor, token velocity, could explain the asset’s lagging price movement. While leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have delivered significant returns over the past month, XRP’s growth has been notably slower. Bitcoin has gained approximately 17%, climbing above the $110,000 mark. Ethereum has seen an even steeper increase, rising nearly 50% to approach $2,700. In comparison, XRP has only recorded a 9% uptick and remains confined to the lower $2 range. Although any upward movement can be viewed positively, some XRP holders have become frustrated with the asset’s limited progress, especially after the sharp price surge seen between November 2024 and January 2025. Analyst Attributes XRP’s Price Stagnation to Token Velocity According to the operator of the “ All Things XRP ” account on X, a potential reason behind the subdued price performance lies in XRP’s high token velocity. The analyst believes that many investors are unfamiliar with the concept and how it affects the token’s market behavior. 74.1% OF XRP INVESTORS DON'T KNOW WHAT \""TOKEN VELOCITY\"" IS. And it could be the real reason XRP struggles to moon. If you hold XRP, you NEED to understand this. Here’s the breakdown. pic.twitter.com/3wcgJv0tRJ — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 27, 2025 Token velocity is an economic metric that measures how frequently a digital asset changes hands over a specific period. It is typically calculated by dividing the total transaction volume by the circulating supply. A high velocity suggests that the asset is actively traded, while a lower value indicates that holders are more inclined to retain it. The analyst argues that a higher velocity exerts downward pressure on price because it implies frequent selling activity. When more holders are willing to retain their tokens rather than trade them, supply becomes constrained, which can support upward price movement. XRP’s Function in the Payments Sector Fuels High Velocity XRP’s design contributes directly to its high velocity. Built for speed and cost-efficiency, the XRP Ledger was intended to facilitate fast transactions, especially within cross-border payments . Many institutions using Ripple’s solutions, such as banks and remittance providers, typically purchase XRP to process transactions and then sell it shortly after. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This transactional behaviour differs from Bitcoin, which is often viewed as a long-term investment, or Ethereum, which benefits from staking and decentralized finance activity that encourages holding. By contrast, XRP’s use in rapid payment settlements keeps it in continuous circulation. Adding to this dynamic are periodic token releases from Ripple’s escrow, which further increase the circulating supply and sustain high transaction volumes. Exploring Strategies to Reduce Velocity and Drive Value To address this challenge, the analyst proposed several ideas aimed at decreasing token velocity and encouraging longer-term holding. One approach involves implementing staking rewards on the XRP Ledger . This would provide holders with incentives to lock up their tokens, reducing market supply and potentially supporting price increases. The analyst emphasized, however, that staking alone may not be sufficient. He pointed to the tokenization of real-world assets, such as property, commodities, and private equity, as a more impactful development. By using XRP in tokenization processes that require extended holding periods, velocity could be reduced, thereby enhancing scarcity and potentially driving price appreciation. He also cautioned against the assumption that XRP’s role in payments alone will significantly increase its value. While the asset performs well in transaction processing, he argued that broader adoption through tokenization would provide a more sustainable and scalable source of demand.

2025-05-24T19:30:15.000Z,"Tron Bulls Regain Control – On-Chain Data Shows Fresh Buying Pressure","While Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have surged to new all-time highs, Tron (TRX) has remained in a tight consolidation range. Despite the broader market’s bullish momentum, TRX is still trading nearly 66% below its early December peak. However, this lagging price action has not gone unnoticed—investors and analysts are increasingly watching Tron as a potential breakout candidate. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger As one of the top-performing Layer-1 blockchains over the past year, Tron’s fundamentals remain strong. The network continues to lead in stablecoin settlement volume and user activity, positioning it well for renewed upside if altcoins follow Bitcoin’s lead. Recent on-chain data from CryptoQuant adds to the optimism: the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta, which measures net buying or selling activity over the past 90 days, shows that TRX has re-entered a buying pressure zone. Historically, this signal has preceded bullish price movements, especially when combined with strong fundamentals and improving market sentiment. If buying pressure persists and price breaks above current resistance levels, Tron could stage a significant rally to catch up with the broader market. For now, all eyes are on whether this fresh demand can spark TRX’s next leg higher. Tron Holds Strong As Bullish Momentum Rebuilds Tron (TRX), one of the most resilient altcoins in recent years, continues to show strength despite a challenging environment for most non-Bitcoin assets. Since late 2022, TRX has followed a steady uptrend, defying broader market corrections and maintaining strong on-chain fundamentals. Now, the asset consolidates near critical technical levels, preparing for what could be its next leg upward. Although Bitcoin has clearly led the current cycle—hitting new all-time highs and attracting the majority of capital—many altcoins like Tron are still lagging. This divergence has led several analysts to question whether an altseason is still on the table. Most believe this is a Bitcoin-dominant cycle, especially given the inflow to BTC ETFs and macroeconomic uncertainty. However, hope remains for a rotation into altcoins. Supporting that optimism, CryptoQuant insights reveal that TRX has returned to a buying pressure zone. The Buy/Sell Pressure Delta shows a clear transition out of the selling pressure area. Demand is once again exceeding supply, favoring bulls. Importantly, TRX has not yet reached the historical thresholds that typically precede price tops. This suggests that there is still room for growth before caution sets in. If the broader market supports a rotation, Tron could emerge as a standout Layer-1 performer once again, especially as traders search for strong setups beyond Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout? Technical Analysis: Bulls Defend Higher Lows Above Support The daily chart for Tron shows that the asset is consolidating after a strong push toward the $0.28 resistance zone. Price action has maintained a clear bullish structure since early April, with higher lows forming consistently along the 34-day EMA ($0.26), which now acts as dynamic support. The 50, 100, and 200 SMAs are all trending upward and tightly aligned beneath the current price, signaling long-term bullish alignment. TRX remains in a short-term consolidation range between approximately $0.26 and $0.28. The price recently tested this upper boundary twice but failed to break through with strong momentum. However, support at $0.26 has held firmly, suggesting buyers are still in control. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows – Volatility Returns To confirm a breakout, bulls must decisively push the price above $0.28 with higher volume, which could open the door to a move toward $0.30 and potentially retest December’s highs near $0.36. On the downside, losing $0.26 would weaken this setup and likely trigger a drop toward the $0.2430 region, where the 100 SMA currently sits.

2025-05-24T19:16:28.000Z,"Early Bitcoin Investors In Search Of Next Big Crypto Backs Mantix Whilst Ethereum Could Hit $4,000 In May","There is new bullish optimism as May has seen Bitcoin reclaim and surge past its $109,000 all time high set in January this year. With the market driven by rampaging AI altcoins and rekindled ETF speculation for many top altcoins, the hunt for the best crypto to buy has never been more frantic. Investors who were fortunate to get Bitcoin at a discounted price after its pull back in April are once again scouring the horizon for the next 100x gem. This time top ICO investors see Mantix built on Ethereum with its $600,000 token presale as a potential 100x ERC20 cointhat is still flying under the radar of so many. Let us find out why. Bitcoin Wipes Out $300 Million In Positions Following EU Tariffs More than $300 million in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated in four hours as a sudden Bitcoin plunge was unleashed by new tariff threats from then U.S. President Donald Trump. As of today, BTC sits at a price of $108,210 and a market cap of $2.15 trillion and Bitcoin has gained 4.48% this week thanks in part to $3.06 billion entering U.S. spot ETFs and news of Morgan Stanley starting direct crypto trading. Analysts believe that a larger increase to $120,000 in Q3 2025 for Bitcoin might occur if support at $100,000 isn’t breached. But, should the price fall below $97,000, the demand for short selling might grow pushing Bitcoin toward $90,000. Ethereum set to break resistance and surge higher Ethereum has confirmed a trend change after months of consolidation, breaking out of its downtrend with a string of solid good bullish signals. The Supertrend indicator went green, Ethereum’s key demand area around $2,400 has held staunchly with ETH at $2,550 today and the downtrend line has been violated with strong buy volume behind the move. Top analysts predict that Ethereum prices can average $3,400 in Q3 2025, with some projecting highs of $4,000 if market sentiment aligns with growing institutional interest. As the second-largest crypto, Ethereum's rise is also lifting the fortunes of many ERC20 coinsbuilt on its chain, Mantix being one of them. Mantix Is new ERC20 DEX backed coin making waves in presale circles Mantix is rapidly gaining traction in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), setting itself up to be a threat to today’s DEX platforms. Powered by the Ethereum blockchain, Mantixenables users to trade, stake and participate in Perpetuals trading with up to 1000x leverage using its native $MTX token.

2025-05-24T19:16:12.000Z,"A Small Food Firm Buys 21 bitcoin, Jumping on BTC Treasury Trend, Shares Fall Anyways","DDC Enterprise (DDC), an Asian food company , has announced the acquisition of 21 BTC as part of a long-term plan to incorporate the cryptocurrency into its corporate treasury. The company, led by founder and CEO Norma Chu, exchanged 254,333 class A ordinary shares for BTC, in a transaction valued at roughly $2.28 million, according to a press release . The move positions DDC among a growing cohort of public companies using BTC as a treasury asset. Two more purchases totaling 79 BTC are expected in the coming days, bringing the company's initial holdings to 100 BTC. In a shareholder letter issued last week, Chu outlined plans to accumulate up to 500 BTC within six months and aim for 5,000 BTC in three years. While companies adopting bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset often see major price rises, DDC saw the opposite. The company’s shares dropped more than 12% on Friday’s trading session, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1%.

The US dollar index also had the worst performance since April, when Donald Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs. Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped to a record high of $111,900, while the market capitalization of all altcoins excluding Bitcoin soared to $1.29 trillion, the highest point since February this year. The Dow Jones, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies, dropped to $41,340, down by 3.45% from its highest level this month. Other top blue-chip indices fell by over 1.2%, erasing billions of dollars in value. The US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback’s performance against a basket of currencies, dropped to $99.10, moving into a technical correction. A correction happens when an asset’s price drops by 10% from a local top.

In it, the biggest asset manager in the world noted that gold was becoming a hedge against the soaring US public debt. Therefore, Bitcoin rose after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating from Triple-A to a notch lower, citing the substantial debt. Moody’s joined the other two rating agencies, S&P Global and Fitch, which have also slashed their Triple-A rating. The sell-off of stocks and the US dollar continued after the House of Representatives voted for Donald Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill, ” which cuts over $4 trillion in taxes. The bill is estimated to increase the public debt by $4 trillion to $5 trillion over a decade, a concerning development as the national debt is approaching $37 trillion. U.S. stocks dropped on Friday after Trump warned that the U.S. would implement a 50% tariff on European goods on June 1. The EU has warned that it will reciprocate, a move that will disrupt annual trade volumes worth over $1.7 trillion. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s fundamentals are strong enough to withstand these concerns. For one, data shows that demand among institutions is rising, as supply continues falling this year. Bitcoin is also seen as digital gold, which may help it do well in the long term.

He said that thanks to these new ETF structures, institutions can trade crypto assets directly through Wall Street. Secondly, Garlinghouse said that this development accelerated the institutionalization of the crypto sector, reminding that the Bitcoin ETF was the fastest ETF to reach $ 1 billion to date.

2025-05-24T18:23:55.000Z,"Robinhood Listing Fuels 20% Surge in MOODENG and MEW","As Robinhood quietly activated two new Solana memecoins: MOODENG and MEW few would have suspected the fireworks that followed. Social media feeds burst within minutes. Traders clamored to get in, and prices for the two tokens increased by nearly 20% within hours. For many, it was déjà vu all over again from the initial days of the meme coin craze. The Background Story of the Tokens MOODENG is not just another animal coin. Its mascot, a perpetually confused-looking baby pygmy hippo, has become a viral sensation on crypto Twitter and TikTok. The community, known as ”The Herd,” has been quite determined with their meme campaign, catapulting MOODENG from unknown to $230 million market cap in a few weeks. Robinhood listing was the spark that ignited a powder keg of retail pent-up demand, and the stock rose 21% in a day. MEW, meanwhile, has a devoted cult following. Hailed as ”the cat that outsmarted the dog coins,” MEW's clever branding and tongue-in-cheek mythos were a hit with day traders hungry for the next new thing. After its strong May, the Robinhood news propelled MEW another 19% higher, with Discord servers and Telegram channels in an uproar speculating as to where the coin would go next. The Surge Unfolds As listings news emerged, order books on large exchanges burst into life. Whale wallets swooped in, making six-figure buys on Coinbase Pro and OKX. On-chain metrics saw the number of new wallets with MOODENG and MEW within spike, suggesting a fresh batch of retail buyers. Activity on both coins tripled overnight, and social media reach reached all-time highs since launch. It wasn't only retail traders piling in. Derivatives indicators revealed a focused blast of leveraged bets on further upside, with open interest in MEW futures at an all-time high. The tension was in the air — memes flew around, and stories of overnight gains circulated far and wide. Can This Spark a New Alt-Season? Robinhood's move comes at a time when the cryptocurrency space is already on edge, with Bitcoin teetering on new all-time highs and regulatory clouds starting to clear in the U.S. Adding MOODENG and MEW is seen by most as a signal: the door is open to more speculative products, and retail traders are chomping at the bit to get back. Traders are watching closely. When Robinhood recently added its most recent crypto, it set off a domino effect that saw dozens of altcoins trend upward. If things keep going as they are, MOODENG and MEW could be the beginning of another wave of retail-fueled rallies. The Takeaway The Robinhood addition of MOODENG and MEW rekindled the meme coin mania for at least now. Prices are increased, volumes are thru the roof, and there's a sense of expectation in the air. For traders and for meme proponents both, it's evidence of just how quickly fortunes can change in crypto and how much gas one listing can feed the next big tear.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9255/robinhood-listing-fuels-20-surge-in-moodeng-and-mew,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T18:02:34.000Z,"Top crypto prices predictions: Jupiter, Bonk, Hyperliquid (HYPE)","The crypto market remained on edge on Saturday after suffering a big reversal on Friday following Donald Trump’s tariff threat on European goods. Bitcoin price was hovering at $108,000, while the market cap of all coins tumbled to $3.4 trillion. This article provides a forecast for top cryptocurrencies like Jupiter (JUP), Bonk (BONK), and Hyperliquid (HYPE). Jupiter price prediction JUP price chart | Source: TradingView Jupiter token has bounced back in the past few weeks, soaring by over 83% from its lowest level this year. Still, it remains significantly below last November’s high of $1.4400. JUP token was trading at $0.5500 on Saturday, a notable level since it was the lowest swing in July last year. It was also the neckline of the head and shoulders chart pattern. It has moved slightly above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls are in control. JUP has also formed an ascending channel shown in red. Therefore, JUP price needs to move above the resistance at $0.6338 to confirm the bullish breakout. There is a risk that it has formed a break-and-retest pattern, by retesting that resistance. A break-and-retest is a popular bearish continuation sign. Bonk price technical analysis Bonk token chart by TradingView Bonk, the second-biggest meme coin on the Solana ecosystem, has bounced back in the past few months. This rebound started after it formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.000008953. It has moved above the neckline at $0.00001543. A double bottom is one of the most common bullish reversal patterns. Bonk price has formed an ascending channel and moved slightly above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. The 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages are about to cross each other, forming a mini-golden cross pattern. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the Bonk price rises and hits the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00003460, which is about 60% above the current level. HYPE price forecast HYPE price chart | Source: TradingView Hyperliquid token price has surged recently as the network has emerged as the biggest player in decentralized finance. Data shows that its protocol handled over $74 billion in transactions in the last seven days. That figure is significantly higher than what top DEX networks like Uniswap and Raydium handled during the month. Hyperliquid has now handled over $1.55 trillion worth of transactions since its founding. The cumulative total is much higher than that of other perpetual futures exchanges like Jupiter, edgeX, GMX, and Vertex Edge, combined. Jupiter has also become a highly profitable player as its daily profits surged to over $5 million this week. The daily chart shows that the HYPE price has soared from about $9.4 on April 7 to $35 today. It crossed the important resistance level at $28.38, the upper side of the cup-and-handle pattern whose depth is about 67%. A C&H is a popular bullish continuation pattern. It has also moved above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, by measuring 67% from the cup’s upper side, we can estimate that the HYPE price will keep rising and possibly hit the target at $47.7. A move below the support at $28 will invalidate the bullish HYPE forecast.

2025-05-24T18:00:43.000Z,"Technical Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Blow Off Top To $325,000  – The Timeline Will Shock You","As the Bitcoin price skyrockets past former all-time highs (ATH), one technical analyst has ignited a wave of excitement across the crypto community with his bold new prediction. According to the forecast, Bitcoin could blow off to an astonishing $325,000 price peak — and the most shocking aspect of this analysis is not just the price target but the accelerated timeline for this meteoric rise. Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K Bitcoin Price To Peak At $325K? The $325,000 Bitcoin price forecast by Gert van Lagen, a prominent crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) is based on a technical analysis chart spanning BTC’s movements from 2009 and 2025. The chart applies Elliott Wave Theory on a High Time Frame (HTF), tracking a massive five-wave impulsive structure, with each wave representing a major bullish cycle driven by halving events. Lagen disclosed that Bitcoin is currently in Wave 5, the last wave of this mega-cycle, suggesting that the market is on the verge of its final parabolic blow-off. Each of Bitcoin’s past bull markets, according to the analysis, has ended with a near-vertical explosive surge, where price accelerates rapidly before crashing into a corrective phase. This surge has always been defined by a price angle of at least 82 degrees from the bottom. The crypto analyst has drawn a trendline connecting the peaks of Wave 1 and 2, creating a rising wedge pattern. The lower boundary of this wedge is represented by the 210,000 block SMA, which acts as a long-term support. Additionally, the upper trendline of this wedge intersects with the forecasted market top of Wave 5, which sits at around $325,000. Notably, this bullish prediction relies heavily on Bitcoin maintaining strong momentum and completing Wave 5 as a single clean impulse move, without any deviation or elongation, just like past cycles. Lagen’s bold $325,000 price forecast for Bitcoin comes with an exceptionally near-term timeline. The market expert predicts that BTC could reach this ambitious target as soon as July 5, 2025, which is just over a month away. Interestingly, this timeline is grounded in the movements observed in previous post-halving cycles. The analyst’s projected trajectory of Bitcoin’s surge to a market top also aligns closely with the past patterns that followed each Bitcoin halving cycle. These halving events have triggered strong bull markets during past cycles. The current rally also follows Bitcoin’s fourth and most recent halving event, which took place on April 20, 2024, reinforcing the repetitive and cyclic nature of Bitcoin’s price movements. A Historic Correction Could Follow This Price Surge Beyond the dramatic $325,000 Bitcoin price prediction, Lagen’s analysis also carries a foreboding bearish outlook. He cautions that after Bitcoin reaches this projected market top, what comes next may be a high time frame price crash, possibly lasting several years. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says Once the five-wave structure is completed, Lagen expects Bitcoin to enter its first true Wave 2 correction at the highest degree.

2025-05-24T17:26:03.000Z,"BTC Hits $110K, XRP Surges — What’s Next for Solaxy, Influencer Pepe (INPEPE), and the Future of Crypto?","Bitcoin has broken past the $110,000 mark, with XRP riding the momentum as crypto markets roar back into the spotlight. In the wake of this rally, investors are scanning for promising altcoins and meme tokens, and Solaxy is gaining traction. The project brands itself as the first-ever Layer 2 solution built on the Solana network—an appealing proposition on paper. However, a closer examination raises questions about its necessity and potential impact. Layer 2 solutions are typically designed to help slow blockchains with high fees—useful for Ethereum, but perhaps less so for Solana, which is already fast and low-cost. Introducing a Layer 2 on a network that doesn’t face major performance issues may not offer meaningful value. While early hype around Solaxy could yield a short-term 5x return, long-term value remains uncertain. This has many investors shifting their focus—and that’s where Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is gaining serious ground. INPEPE Has a Stronger Foundation: Real Tools, Real Market Impact, Real Vision While Solaxy benefits from technical intrigue, Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is quickly emerging as the top utility-focused meme coin of 2025. INPEPE offers a real-world solution to a massive market—the $25+ billion influencer economy—by acting as a borderless, fee-free payment system for digital creators. Unlike meme coins driven solely by hype, INPEPE is built for long-term ecosystem growth. Its core features include: Instant, borderless payouts for creators No platform fees or intermediaries On-chain proof of performance and engagement A staking APY of 4754%, offering unmatched passive income potential Education and community resources, helping users navigate crypto with confidence With a presale price of just $0.0000002051, $150,093.82 has already been raised toward the $505,881 funding goal—demonstrating strong early demand. What Sets Influencer Pepe Apart in the 2025 Meme Coin Arena: Built for Utility – Unlike meme coins with no function, INPEPE solves real problems for creators struggling with delayed payments and platform fees. Massive Staking Yields – Early users can earn a whopping 4754% APY through the staking dashboard. Cultural and Financial Relevance – INPEPE bridges the influencer economy with blockchain technology, giving it both narrative and utility strength. Upcoming Tier 1 Exchange Listings – Roadmap includes listings on top crypto exchanges. Viral Community Growth – Driven by creator partnerships and community memes, the project is gaining visibility beyond traditional crypto circles. The Origin Story: Why INPEPE Could Be Bigger Than the Meme INPEPE draws inspiration from meme coin giants like PEPE and Dogecoin but adds functionality and purpose. According to community supporters, the meme legacy of “Pepe” was missing two critical pillars—Technology and Optimization—which INPEPE aims to fulfill. Rather than clinging to nostalgia, Influencer Pepe has built a practical framework for creator payments in Web3. As the influencer economy moves toward decentralization, INPEPE is poised to become the go-to payment method for digital talent and content creators. Some even speculate that individuals tied to early Pepe coin developments are involved in INPEPE’s mission—offering both a cultural reset and a technical upgrade to the meme coin model. The Bottom Line: INPEPE Brings Real Utility in a Time When Meme Coins Must Offer More The market has matured. With Bitcoin above $110K and XRP surging, investors are prioritizing substance over spectacle. The days of meme coins pumping purely on internet jokes are fading—projects now need utility, structure, and a vision. Influencer Pepe delivers on all fronts—from staking and payment rails to education and ecosystem growth. It’s a meme coin designed not just to entertain, but to function. Solaxy may still enjoy attention as Solana’s experimental Layer 2, but for those looking to back a meme coin with real-world adoption potential, INPEPE is proving to be the more complete package. What a $10,000 Investment in Influencer Pepe Could Mean for Your Portfolio? Some early adopters are already speculating that a $10,000 investment in Influencer Pepe today could potentially 64x, reaching $640,000 — especially as the influencer economy continues to grow. With the global influencer industry projected to hit $48 billion by 2027, projects that merge crypto with creator culture are catching serious attention. If $INPEPE gains traction as a go-to payment option among influencers, its market cap could challenge — or even surpass — meme coin giants like Dogecoin and PEPE. That kind of adoption could fuel the kind of momentum meme coin investors dream of. How to Join the $INPEPE Project: Set Up a Wallet – Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Add Funds – Deposit ETH, USDT, or BNB. Access the Presale – Visit influencerpepe.com to buy tokens. Stake and Earn – Begin earning high APY rewards through the staking dashboard. Why $INPEPE Stands Out? INPEPE merges meme energy with real-world functionality. With its zero-fee payout model, high staking returns, and Web3 creator tools, the project is turning heads across the retail and influencer communities. And here’s the big picture: if just a fraction of the $48 billion influencer marketing industry adopts INPEPE as a preferred payment method, the token could realistically challenge—and even outperform legacy meme coins like Dogecoin and PEPE in terms of market cap. In a market driven increasingly by utility-backed narratives, Influencer Pepe is leading the next wave of meme coin evolution.

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Laevitas.chAmong the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price.Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price declineIf Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry. However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches.The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for short (sell) positions. Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions.Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.In the Solana ecosystem, the \""Non-Chief Marketing Officer\"" (nCMO) is a role within the Solana Foundation that focuses on supporting the Solana community's marketing efforts.Related: Fractionalization of real world assets: Is this the holy grail of blockchain tech?Markets remain above historical averagesPublic equity markets in the US have been trading above their historical valuation norms for a long time.

Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy.

Therefore, traders should exercise caution.What are the critical support levels for Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionSellers are trying to sustain the price below the breakout level of $109,588, which may trap the aggressive bulls. That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA. The pair could plunge to $2,323 and then to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating a balance between supply and demand.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($2.35) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting that the XRP/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.A break and close above $2.65 will complete a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $3.70. Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That increases the likelihood of a drop to $1.60 and subsequently to $1.27.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) turned down sharply from the $693 resistance on May 23, signaling aggressive selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe BNB/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($647), as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. That shows solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will again try to thrust the price above $693. If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($612).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) climbed above the $180 resistance on May 23, but the bears are posing a strong challenge at $185.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($167) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers sustain the price above $185, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $210 and later to $220.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That heightens the risk of a drop to the 50-day SMA ($147).Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) turned down from the $0.26 overhead resistance on May 23, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe DOGE/USDT pair could descend to the 20-day EMA ($0.21), which is an important support to watch out for. A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA signals a positive sentiment, improving the prospect of a break above $0.26. If that happens, the pair could rally to $0.35. There is resistance at $0.29, but it is likely to be crossed.This optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below $0.21. That suggests a possible range-bound action between $0.14 and $0.26.Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) bounced off the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern, but the bulls could not clear the overhead obstacle at $0.86.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price continues lower and breaks below the neckline, it shows that the bears are active at higher levels. The ADA/USDT pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.69) and later to the solid support at $0.60.Contrarily, a solid bounce off the 20-day EMA ($0.75) shows demand at lower levels. The bulls will then again attempt to kick the price above $0.86. If they succeed, the pair could ascend to $1.01.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?Sui price predictionBuyers failed to push Sui (SUI) above the overhead resistance of $4.25 on May 22, indicating that the bears are aggressively defending the level.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewRepeated failure to cross the $4.25 level may have tempted short-term buyers to book profits. That pulled the price below the 20-day EMA ($3.73). If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the SUI/USDT pair could plummet to the 50-day SMA ($3.09).On the contrary, if the price turns up from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $4.25, it indicates the resumption of the up move. The pair could climb to $5 and eventually to $5.37, where the bears are expected to step in.Hyperliquid price predictionHyperliquid (HYPE) soared above the stiff overhead resistance of $28.50 on May 22, indicating the start of the next leg of the up move.HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls pushed the price above the $35.73 resistance on May 23, but the long wick on the candlestick shows the bears are trying to defend the level.

If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly drag the price back below the 20-day EMA ($26.32).

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears are trying to pull the price back into the descending channel. If the price skids below the neckline, it suggests that the breakout above the resistance line may have been a bull trap. The LINK/USDT pair could sink to $13.20, keeping the price stuck inside the channel for some more time.Conversely, a solid bounce off the resistance line indicates that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:52:03.000Z,"Who attended Trump’s controversial memecoin dinner?","The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.However, some attendees spoke to the press or took to social media to talk about the dinner. Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

The anti-addiction-themed memecoin (Odom had a public battle with substance addiction) is issued on the Solana blockchain.The coin itself had a 20% “Trump Dinner Program” staking scheme, where TRUMP holders could stake their coins with Odom’s project, ostensibly to enable him to attend the dinner event, and receive ODOM airdrops in return. Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack. Source: CoinGeckoSui’s Cetus devs have a phantom exchange on SolanaA similar negotiation strategy used by the Cetus team on Sui was successfully employed years ago to recover funds for Crema. The Solana project hasn’t posted on its X account since March 2023, and its trading platform now sees negligible volume, but it still didn’t end well for the hacker.Crema suffered an approximately $9-million hack in 2022. Much like the Cetus case, the Crema hacker was offered a deal to return the funds while keeping $1.6 million in exchange for not reporting the attack to law enforcement.Cetus offers a $6-million reward and exemption from further legal action from the project if the remaining funds are returned.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why? The ‘founders’ own the majority of supply & there are only 114 validators!” Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, wrote on X.Some users challenge Bons’ claim, arguing that decentralization doesn’t mean a free-for-all. Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit. Source: CoinGeckoSui and Cetus backlash contrasts recent hacksThe Cetus exploit has spotlighted the persistent security challenges in DeFi while raising deeper questions around who holds the reins in supposedly decentralized networks like Sui.The team’s $6-million offer to the hacker mirrors the playbook it used with Crema — but this time, the crypto community isn’t as forgiving. With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer. Two Ethereum wallets tied to the exploiter still hold over $60 million in ETH, with no movement at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice?

2025-05-23T13:00:00.000Z,"Ledn ditches ETH, shifts to full custody model for Bitcoin loans","Digital asset lender Ledn is transitioning to fully collateralized Bitcoin lending and discontinuing support for Ethereum, in moves designed to consolidate its BTC-focused business and further safeguard client assets against credit risks.In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin (BTC) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event.This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash.Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000. Instead of selling their assets for cash, long-term investors can borrow against their holdings.

Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company.Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official.“I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng ZhaoWSJ reports on Steve and Zach WitkoffZhao’s response follows a WSJ investigation highlighting a complex string of diplomatic and business interests involving WLF. The report raised concerns about the blurred lines between public duties and private interests and focused on diplomatic and business dealings involving WLF co-founders Steve Witkoff and his son, Zach Witkoff. Steve Witkoff serves as the US Special Envoy to the Middle East under the Trump administration, while Zach Witkoff has been involved in securing a reported $2 billion crypto deal.The report raised questions about whether diplomatic efforts overlapped with private crypto ventures, and implied Zhao may have been attempting to curry favor with the Trump administrationOn May 6, Zhao confirmed that he is seeking a pardon from the Trump administration for his earlier money laundering conviction. The report also highlighted that WLFI, which raised over $600 million in token sales, does not disclose the names of all its investors aside from some publicly known ones like Tron founder Justin Sun, who attended Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. Trump hosted the dinner for the largest investors of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin.

He said the forces behind the publication want to hinder efforts to make the US a crypto capital. “They want to attack crypto, global crypto leaders and the pro-crypto administration,” CZ claimed, saying the article is part of a broader effort to stifle the industry’s growth in the US.This is not the first time Zhao has clapped back at the WSJ recently.

However, BTC price retraced shortly after to trade at $110,700 at the time of writing. Despite the correction, there are mixed signals about whether the price rally is overheated or whether this is a healthy pullback. Bitcoin “still not overheated” — analystBitcoin is not showing any signs of being overheated despite reaching new all-time highs this week, with several analysts pointing to fundamentals suggesting Bitcoin could rise further.“Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited,” said CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan in a May 22 Quicktake note. Crypto Dan pointed out that Bitcoin’s funding rate, an indicator of market overheating, shows an increase in long bets.

2025-05-23T08:47:40.000Z,"DeFi near-zero onboarding costs can help 1.4B unbanked: 1inch co-founder","Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have a major cost advantage over traditional banks when it comes to onboarding new users, according to Anton Bukov, co-founder of decentralized exchange (DEX) 1inch.Speaking at a panel during Dutch Blockchain Week on May 22 in Amsterdam, Bukov said traditional banks spend between $100 and $300 per user to verify documents and set up accounts. Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices.Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.Total Bitcoin futures OI.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

He pleaded not guilty to all charges in June 2023.A jury convicted him in November on the unlicensed money-transmitting business charge and on just one of the money laundering charges, finding him not guilty of a separate money laundering charge.Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-questions-asked-bitcoin-launderer-gets-6-years?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Merkley is expected to attend a protest organized by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, outside the Trump venue on May 22. Warren held a press conference with Merkley, Senator Chris Murphy and Public Citizen representatives, calling on Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner event.

Source: CoinGlassSome traders argue that the increased demand for leveraged XRP positions indicates growing institutional interest, especially as multiple issuers filed for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in the US. However, the final decision by the US SEC should be made in October.Excessive demand for bullish leveraged XRP causes a positive funding rate, meaning longs (buyers) are the ones paying the carry cost.

Still, the current optimism level is nowhere near the 100% annualized funding rate from Dec. 4, 2024, which followed an impressive 7-day rally to $2.90 from $1.33. Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions.

2025-05-22T15:58:14.000Z,"Bitcoin could go much higher due to lack of FOMO and futures market euphoria — Analysts","Key takeaways:Bitcoin’s rally to new price highs happened as funding rates and trading sentiment remained unusually subdued.Rising stablecoin supply and global M2 growth indicate untapped liquidity and the potential for further price increases.Long-term holders are not aggressively selling, reflecting their expectation for continued Bitcoin price appreciation.Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on May 21, with prices rising to $111,860 on Binance on May 22, but the markets lack the state of frenzy associated with new highs. Economist and crypto commentator Alex Krüger noted that “this is the least euphoric new all-time highs” for Bitcoin, after highlighting subdued funding rates for Bitcoin across crypto exchanges.Bitcoin price and aggregated funding rate. Source: CoinalyzeThe chart illustrates that the current BTC funding rate is significantly below previous market highs observed during March and November 2024. The funding rate was six times higher in Q1 and three times higher in Q4 last year.These low rates indicate minimal speculative activity in the futures market, with the rally driven by spot buyers rather than leveraged traders, reducing the risk of over-leveraged corrections. Such a scenario also indicates that Bitcoin might not have reached a state of euphoria yet. The availability of untapped liquidity in the crypto ecosystem underscores the potential for further growth. Stablecoin market capitalization, often a leading indicator of incoming capital, has risen to 14% in 2025. Tether’s (USDT) market cap jumped to $152 billion from $139 billion in January, while Circle’s USDC supply has increased by 35% to $58 billion. Total stablecoin supply. Source: Token TerminalStablecoins often act as a bridge for new capital entering the crypto market, and their growth suggests a substantial pool of liquidity that has yet to be fully deployed into Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Additionally, global liquidity trends provide further tailwinds. The global M2 money supply, which measures the total money in circulation across major economies, grew by 5% in Q1 2025, driven by monetary policy adjustments in the US, EU, and Japan. Cointelegraph reported a strong correlation, exceeding 80%, between Bitcoin’s price and global liquidity, typically with a 60-day lag, pointing to further buying pressure in the coming months.Bitcoin price and Global M2 supply.
