2025-06-11T19:55:01,"Payments Giant Stripe To Acquire Crypto Wallet Provider Privy Following $1,000,000,000 Purchase of Stablecoin Firm: Report","Payments platform Stripe has announced its acquisition of a crypto wallet provider shortly after closing a $1 billion deal to purchase the stablecoin firm Bridge. In a post on the social media platform X, crypto wallet company Privy says it’s been bought out by Stripe, a firm that provides payment infrastructure for businesses. “Today, we’re proud to announce that Stripe is acquiring Privy. We couldn’t be more excited. Privy will continue as an independent product – but now we’ll move faster, ship more, and serve you even better, so you can stay focused on your users.” Earlier this year, Stripe completed its purchase of stablecoin issuer Bridge, the company behind USDB , a programmable dollar-pegged crypto asset backed by a combination of cash and money market funds held by BlackRock. As stated by Zach Abrams, co-founder of Bridge, at the time, “We closed our acquisition with Stripe! Together we’re scaling digital dollars to businesses everywhere. Stablecoins aren’t the future- they’re already transforming how people move money today.” Earlier this month, Stripe reportedly was in talks with unnamed banks regarding their potential use of stablecoins. Stripe co-founder and president John Collison said that banks seem eager to work with dollar-pegged digital assets. “In the conversations we have with them, they’re very interested. This is not something that banks are just kind of brushing away or treating as a fad. Banks are very interested in how they should be integrated with stablecoins into their product offerings as well.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-11T19:30:49,"Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Admits He Was Wrong About Dogecoin","At Ripple Apex, the company’s flagship gathering for developers and partners, Ripple president Monica Long and chief executive Brad Garlinghouse took the stage for an unscripted fireside chat that quickly zeroed in on one of the industry’s most polarizing sub-sectors: meme coins. In an exchange that mingled candor with contrition, Garlinghouse acknowledged that his once-unyielding dismissal of Dogecoin no longer holds. Dogecoin Forces Ripple CEO To Backtrack The session began with the moderator’s binary provocation—meme coins, overrated or underrated?—to which Long replied that, taken at face value, many are “outright scams,” yet their speculative magnetism has nevertheless “miraculously become real functioning markets.” Long credited the phenomenon with seeding vital infrastructure—wallets, capital, developer mind-share—that she likened to Ethereum’s own 2016–2017 ICO surge. “There’s a lasting impact from meme coins,” she said. The Ripple CEO offered what he called “the other side” of the argument. “I think meme coins are generally maybe grossly overrated,” he said, framing most of them as “not sustainable” projects that amplify regulatory skepticism. He contrasted that short-term gambling impulse with what he described as Ripple’s “long arcs of time” approach. Yet the conversation turned when Garlinghouse revisited Dogecoin, a target of his past derision. “For people who have followed some of my public statements, I used to really speak not so kindly towards Dogecoin,” he admitted. “I was just like, Dogecoin? It literally was created as a lark… it is literally a pile of shit as the logo.” His original objection, he explained, was that an asset conceived as parody could not credibly represent an industry courting institutional capital: “If we’re trying to engage institutions and build those bridges between traditional finance and decentralized finance… Dogecoin isn’t representing us well.” What changed his mind was not a newfound appreciation for the token’s fundamentals but the market reality forged by Elon Musk’s relentless advocacy . “Where I agree with Monica, and I think I got wrong, is Elon Musk willed Dogecoin into so much liquidity that it’s not going away,” the Ripple CEO conceded. “It’s part of the ecosystem. It plays a role.” Even with that reversal, Garlinghouse made clear that most meme-coin launches remain “get-rich-quick rug pulls” that “reflect badly on those of us in the industry trying to build real products for real customers.” He cited US Senator Elizabeth Warren ’s focus on negative use cases as a political example of how hype-driven projects can taint the wider field. Pressed to nominate a single meme that captures crypto’s “chaos or brilliance,” Garlinghouse did not hesitate: “Doge. It is both the chaos and the brilliance.” Musk’s influence, he said, demonstrated how “liquidity begets liquidity,” underscoring the difficulty newcomers face in replicating Dogecoin’s network effects amid today’s “explosion” of imitators. Long, for her part, maintained that even dubious tokens serve as experimental sandboxes that, over time, strengthen underlying blockchains. Garlinghouse ultimately stuck with his “overrated” verdict for meme coins as a category, yet his concession on Dogecoin—effectively elevating it from punchline to permanent fixture—marked a notable shift for the CEO of a company long positioned at the institutional end of the spectrum. At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.201.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-wrong-about-dogecoin/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|Brad Garlinghouse|Doge|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|ripple|ripple news",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T19:28:36,"Analyst says GameStop's stock is still overpriced because traders hope to sell it to someone else at a higher price","GameStop is still being pumped like it’s got something real behind it, but the only thing holding it up is a line of people praying they can flip their shares to someone dumber. That’s the whole strategy. There’s no big plan, no actual growth, just blind hope and overpriced stock. According to Wedbush’s Michael Pachter, who put out a note on Wednesday, GameStop has no clear direction. He said, “Despite a complete lack of a clear strategy, GameStop has consistently capitalized on the existence of ‘greater fools’ willing to pay more than twice its asset value for its shares — and so far, they’ve been correct.” This came after the company’s Tuesday earnings showed a drop in first-quarter revenue, which was expected because people are buying games online, not walking into stores. But instead of fixing their core business, GameStop took a wild detour, buying 4,710 bitcoins worth over half a billion dollars. It’s copying the same move MicroStrategy made, but here’s the problem: MicroStrategy is a tech company with actual value. GameStop is not. Buying Bitcoin isn’t a business strategy Michael thinks this Bitcoin plan makes no sense. He wrote, “It is difficult to understand why any investor would be willing to pay more than 2x cash value for the possibility of GameStop converting more of its cash into Bitcoin.” GameStop’s stock is already trading at 2.4 times its actual cash, which means it’s way overvalued. There’s no way putting more money into crypto is going to make it worth even more. Investors who believe in Bitcoin can just buy the coin or an ETF themselves. They don’t need GameStop as the middleman. CEO Ryan Cohen claimed the move was about macroeconomic fears. He said Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralization could help the company hedge against bigger risks. That doesn’t explain how a video game chain plans to survive while turning into a crypto treasury. Bitcoin might be solid, but it’s not a business model for a retail company that’s bleeding relevance. Michael didn’t hold back. He doubled down on his underperform rating and gave GameStop a 12-month target of $13.50 — that’s 55% lower than the $30.15 close on Tuesday. He broke that down to $12.50 in cash per share and $1 for the company’s business itself. “GME shares trade at a level that overlooks the many challenges ahead,” he said . GameStop is using Bitcoin like a smokescreen, but there’s still no real answer for why it exists as a retail business today. They didn’t lay out any future direction. They didn’t explain how they plan to compete with digital game downloads. They just dropped a crypto bomb and left everyone to figure it out. Greater fool theory is doing the heavy lifting Every part of this situation is built on the greater fool theory. That’s the idea that you can make money off a worthless or overvalued asset, not because it’s good, but because someone else might buy it from you for even more. It only works as long as you find a bigger fool. Once that chain breaks, the last one holding the asset is stuck with it. That’s exactly what’s happening here. Investors aren’t buying GameStop because they believe in the company. They’re betting they can flip their shares for a profit. They think someone else will see the price go higher and jump in, even though the business underneath hasn’t improved. The problem is that this can’t last forever. Once people realize the stock price is disconnected from reality, the sell-off starts. And when that happens, the shares will crash back down to something closer to what the business is actually worth — maybe less. Everyone who bought in late gets burned. Everyone who sold earlier walks away with the money. Michael’s breakdown shows how fragile the whole thing is. GameStop is leaning on crypto and the hope that its loyal army of speculative traders sticks around. But even that crowd has limits. And if the company keeps dodging its real problems, the last fools in line are going to pay for it.

2025-06-11T19:27:07,"Major Binance Whales May Have Signaled Bitcoin’s Direction — Here Are Their Moves","Cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoQuant has published a remarkable assessment of the current state of Bitcoin. According to the firm’s analysts, the behavior of whales on Binance shows that Bitcoin has proven its resilience again by holding above $100,000. According to CryptoQuant data, when Bitcoin approaches or surpasses all-time highs, Binance whales typically send large amounts of BTC to the exchange in an attempt to book profits. These moves are reflected in sharp increases in inflow volumes to the exchange. Analysts recall that during the peak period in early 2024, Binance saw over $5.3 billion in BTC inflows, while in previous cycle peaks, these figures reached $8.45 billion and $7.24 billion. It is stated that such large inflows are usually followed by short- or medium-term corrections. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Unleashes Listing Storm - Announcements Coming One After Another - Here's the Latest Altcoin They've Chosen However, the situation is different in the current situation. According to the latest data, BTC inflows to Binance are only around $3 billion and this figure continues to decrease. This shows that whales are currently avoiding selling and continue to hold on to their Bitcoins in anticipation of higher profits. CryptoQuant analysts argue that this attitude of Binance whales should not be ignored: “Considering the impact that these whale entries could have on the market, the current stance of Binance whales clearly signals a bullish trend.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T19:08:48,"Bitcoin Should Be In Every Portfolio To Hedge Against Inflation, Asserts Billionaire BTC Bull Paul Tudor Jones","Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones is worried about the state of the U.S. economy and its mounting debt. His investing solution to hedge against inflation includes buying commodities such as Bitcoin. US national debt currently stands at $37 trillion and counting. Jones argued that the U.S. is stuck in a “debt trap” and that policymakers will likely keep real interest rates below inflation to reduce the burden, the veteran investor told Bloomberg TV on June 11. President Trump will likely tap an “uber-dovish” Fed chairman to replace Jerome Powell, whose tenure at the central bank is set to end in 2026. That means higher prices, lower purchasing power, and bigger risk for traditional portfolios, Jones, who founded hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation, noted. In other words, the only way a nation gets out of such high debt is to inflate its way out of it. To hedge against that ugly scenario, Tudor Jones thinks every portfolio should consist of Bitcoin, gold, and stocks. “It would be some combination of vol-adjusted bitcoin, gold, and stocks,” Jones opined, highlighting that BTC’s price swings are much more wild than those of gold, so the sizes of the positions should vary. Still, he astutely clarified: “That’s probably your best portfolio to fight inflation.” Notably, Bitcoiners have long touted the flagship cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation, just like the yellow metal. Jones has oftentimes stated in the past that he likes Bitcoin and that the asset can be held by investors in times of economic uncertainty. Though he previously suggested allocating 5% to BTC , he refused to give a figure during the recent Bloomberg interview — though he doubled down on his strong belief in the crypto. The legendary investor’s comments come after the Consumer Price Index accelerated to a year-on-year pace of 2.4% in May, indicating that U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war has had a limited impact on the economy. At around $109,536, the price of BTC is up more than 64% in the year to-date, according to crypto data provider CoinMarketCap . Analysts are eyeing price targets for BTC past its current all-time high of $111,814.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-should-be-in-every-portfolio-to-hedge-against-inflation-asserts-billionaire-btc-bull-paul-tudor-jones/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|BTG","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

These massive funds will be raised through a securities purchase agreement with two big investment firms. This move shows that the company is getting more involved in artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology . Interactive Strength Begins FET Token Investment Interactive Strength, a company known for making smart fitness machines, is now moving into crypto and AI. The company has already started buying FET tokens with an initial investment of $55 million from DWF Labs and ATW Partners. The goal is to build a strong position in the cryptocurrency market and increase the company’s value over time. Interactive Strength CEO Trent Ward believes that Fetch.ai is a leader in combining AI and crypto, which he sees as the two biggest tech trends. He believes this investment could benefit shareholders who own TRNR stock in the long term. Interactive Strength will partner with BitGo, a trusted crypto company, to help manage its growing FET holdings. BitGo will handle both the trading and safe storage of the tokens, helping keep things secure and clear for the company and its investors. The FET token is worth about $2.1 billion, making it the 61st most prominent cryptocurrency. Interactive Strength is worth around $8 million, according to Google Finance. Fetch.ai Uses AI for Real-World Tools Fetch.ai is a technology company that combines artificial intelligence and blockchain. It runs as a decentralized platform, meaning no single group controls it. This platform uses autonomous artificial intelligence agents. These agents help people create useful tools for fitness, delivery services, and finance. As part of the deal, Fetch.ai will partner with Interactive Strength to improve its AI-powered personal training platform. The goal is to make workouts more personalized and helpful using smart technology. Growing Interest in Crypto and AI Interactive Strength’s decision adds to the growing list of businesses experimenting with digital assets for growth. Many companies are now adding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) to their treasuries. Recent changes in United States regulations often support these decisions. Crypto-friendly rules have made it easier for companies to own and manage digital assets legally and securely. At the same time, more technology companies are looking for ways to combine artificial intelligence with blockchain. In May, Tether announced the launch of Tether AI , a new open-source tool designed to support decentralized artificial intelligence on smart devices. This shows how the connection between AI and blockchain is growing stronger and becoming more popular in many industries.

The CEO said, “It will be a stablecoin, quite clearly. It will be completely backed by the dollar… it is no different than a bank account.” On the other hand, it was noted in the interview that cryptocurrencies and digital strategies were also evaluated in terms of the global competitiveness of the United States. Comments that Bitcoin could be considered a strategic asset and that there was a consensus on this issue in some units of the US military were also included in the interview. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Unleashes Listing Storm - Announcements Coming One After Another - Here's the Latest Altcoin They've Chosen The interview also noted that, contrary to critics such as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's approach to crypto investments as a waste of resources, some generals in the US military have emphasized the importance of strategic digital assets such as Bitcoin, especially in Southeast Asia. Compared to companies like JP Morgan and Citigroup, Bank of America has been cautious about entering the crypto space, but changing regulations could change the bank’s stance. The Trump administration has made it clear that it will support all efforts in the crypto space.

2025-06-11T18:49:11,"Bitcoin price target: rally to $111k likely as soft CPI print fuels rate cut talks","Bitcoin is entering a period of volatility, as macro effects align for a short-term rally to $111,000, according to Bitfinex Head of Derivatives Jag Kooner. Macro factors, including a potential U.S.– China trade deal and cooler-than-expected inflation figures, are aligning to support another Bitcoin (BTC) ally. On Wednesday, June 11, Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, shared his insights on Bitcoin with crypto.news. Kooner believes that a possible agreement between the U.S. and China could help reduce uncertainty and boost market sentiment. However, he noted that the optimism may already be priced in, meaning the immediate impact on markets could be limited. You might also like: Why are Bitcoin and crypto prices going up today? Instead, the most likely near-term effect is increased volatility. The same applies to the latest inflation reading, which rose just 0.1% on a monthly basis. Together, these developments suggest that Bitcoin may be setting up for significant price action in the near future, according to Kooner. “Core CPI up 0.1% m/m firms up rate cut bets, compresses real yields, and creates a vacuum above $111K for bitcoin. That move would likely be spot-driven, with ETF demand accelerating as the macro regime shifts toward easing,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex. You might also like: Bitcoin is key to fighting inflation, says billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones Bitcoin to reach $111K: Bitfinex analyst Lower inflation could increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, potentially giving Bitcoin a boost. According to Kooner, this theme could dominate crypto market sentiment over the next two weeks, possibly pushing Bitcoin toward $111,000, close to its all-time high. “BTC’s tight correlation with the S&P 500 (30D r ~0.63) reveals its current role as a liquidity barometer rather than a volatility hedge. This correlation makes BTC highly sensitive to SPX range-bound conditions, and until the index breaks out, BTC’s upside remains constrained,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex. Still, Bitcoin’s upside remains tied to stock market performance. The strong correlation with equities means that any breakout may depend on the S&P 500 moving out of its current range. If that happens, both Bitcoin and altcoins could move sharply higher, offering gains for crypto holders. Read more: Will Bitcoin continue rising?

More corporates adopted Saylor’s strategy of adding Bitcoin to their treasury, and Circle made a stellar IPO debut on Nasdaq last week. These developments are key catalysts driving Bitcoin’s gains and the rise in US crypto stocks. Circle Internet Group (CRCL), one of the largest stablecoin issuers, wiped out nearly 8% on the day, down to $106.62. The stock erased its Monday days nearly entirely. Core Scientific Inc. (CORZ), CleanSpark Inc. (CLSK), and MARA Holdings Inc. (MARA), key crypto mining stocks, observed small changes in their price on Tuesday. CORZ is down 0.12%, CLSK is up 0.10%, and MARA gained 0.25% on the day. Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) gained 0.60% on Tuesday. Bitcoin slipped closer to its support at $108,000 on the day, as crypto stocks continued their consolidation. Bitcoin’s correlation to the S&P 500 has recently dropped, which supports a thesis of equity investors choosing to gain exposure to crypto through stocks, instead of direct access to tokens that entails the risk of custody and security.

The S&P 500, for example, is trading approximately 3% below its all-time high. However, the risk of a reversal remains, particularly if upcoming economic data disappoints. All eyes are now on tomorrow’s U.S. inflation report. While markets are pricing in a moderate uptick, a higher-than-expected reading could trigger increased volatility across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.” Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

2025-06-11T18:48:18,"HB7082 Enacted: Connecticut Prohibits Crypto in State Treasury","Connecticut has made a bold move to distance itself from government cryptocurrency involvement by unanimously passing House Bill 7082, now known as Public Act No. 25-66. This marks the country’s most expansive state-level prohibition on crypto-related government activity. Connecticut Shuts Door on State-Backed Crypto Projects The new law bars all state and municipal bodies from establishing cryptocurrency reserves or accepting digital assets as payment for taxes, fees, or any financial obligations. This sweeping action effectively halts any future state-supported crypto projects in Connecticut. In addition to the investment ban, the legislation outlines rigorous consumer protections for virtual currency service providers. Companies involved in money transmission must prominently display warnings that transactions are irreversible and that losses from fraud or errors may be unrecoverable. They are also required to disclose all material risks to customers and verify the identity of users under the age of 18. The legislation also revises the state’s broader financial oversight laws and introduces new definitions surrounding key digital finance terms such as digital wallets, kiosks, and control persons. Moreover, it compels crypto businesses licensed in Connecticut to implement enhanced compliance programs that meet new state standards. This hardline stance contrasts sharply with the growing number of states actively pursuing digital asset adoption. Bitcoin Laws data reveals that 31 states are currently considering Bitcoin reserve bills. Of them, 16 have advanced while 8 rejected similar measures. While some of those rejections may still be revisited, Connecticut’s legislation is significant for the breadth and decisiveness of its restrictions. First in the Nation Last month, New Hampshire officially became the first US state to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. On May 6, Governor Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 302 into law, which allowed the state treasury to invest up to 5% of its funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets with market capitalizations over $500 billion. Currently, only Bitcoin qualifies. The law, which is inspired by Satoshi Action’s policy framework, requires secure, US-regulated custody and aims to diversify reserves while upholding fiscal responsibility.

2025-06-11T18:41:53,"$230,000 Bitcoin Price ‘Fair Value’ Amid Likelihood of Sovereign Debt Default, According to Bitwise","Crypto asset manager Bitwise says the possibility of countries failing to repay their debts may drive Bitcoin ( BTC ) to an astronomical new all-time high. In a new report, Bitwise analysts say that growing debt levels of countries and the increasing odds of sovereign default may send Bitcoin to $230,000, a more than 110% increase from its current value, under the assumption that more investors will pour into the flagship crypto asset as a hedge. “As we have pointed out in our latest monthly report as well, Bitcoin can provide an alternative ‘portfolio insurance’ against widespread sovereign defaults as a scarce decentralized asset which is free of counterparty risks. Quantitative models estimate Bitcoin’s hypothetical ‘fair value’ amid the current sovereign default probabilities at around $230,000 today. This estimation is dovetailed by Bitcoin’s increasing scarcity which also points to an ascent towards $200,000 by the end of the year.” Bitwise also suggests that the United States’ mounting debt level may lead to debasement of the dollar, potentially making Bitcoin a more attractive asset to park wealth. “We also expect that the US fiscal debt situation will most likely continue to deteriorate over the coming years which is also the official projection by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO): net interest expenses will likely triple towards the end of this decade already – from ~$1 trillion to ~$3 trillion by the year 2030. Non-discretionary government outlays – i.e. those that are mandatory and required by law, such as interest expenses, social security, unemployment insurance etc. – already exceed 100% of fiscal revenues. The proposed tax cuts by the Trump administration will likely exacerbate this situation.” Bitcoin is trading for $109,467 at time of writing.

2025-06-11T18:41:10,"Ukraine Lawmakers Introduce Historic Bill For Establishment Of Crypto Asset Reserve","Eight Ukrainian lawmakers submitted a draft bill that would authorize the country’s National Bank to add cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to the country’s reserve. Submitted to Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, on Tuesday, bill number 13356 proposes amendments to the law “On the National Bank of Ukraine” regarding the addition of crypto assets to the traditional reserves, including gold and foreign currencies. Yaroslav Zheleznyak, who sponsored the bill, serves as first deputy chairman of the Committee on Finance, Tax and Customs Policy. In a post on Telegram, Zheleznyak described the bill as a “step [to] integrate Ukraine into global financial innovations.” However, he noted that the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) would retain full control over whether, how much, and when to allocate a portion of its reserves to crypto. “How, when and how much should be the decision of the regulator itself,” Zhelezniak wrote. Crypto Reserves To Strengthen Macroeconomic Stability Zheleznyak clarified that if the bill became law, the policy would not demand the NBU to acquire crypto as part of state reserves; it would only have the option of doing so. Nonetheless, the lawmaker asserted that creating a crypto reserve would integrate Ukraine into global financial innovations. “Proper management of crypto reserves will help strengthen macroeconomic stability and create new opportunities for the development of the digital economy,” he explained. Ukraine already holds 46,351 BTC, valued at over $5 billion, a figure trailing the holdings of the U.S., China, and the U.K., according to data tracked by BiTBO. Global Crypto Reserve Spree In 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender and establish a BTC reserve. The Latin American nation has continued accumulating the maiden crypto for its reserve despite efforts by the International Monetary Fund to freeze crypto acquisitions. In the United States, President Donald Trump earlier this year signed an Executive Order paving the way for a “digital Fort Knox” strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate Digital Asset stockpile. Other countries, such as the Czech Republic , Brazil, and Pakistan , have also been moving towards integrating digital currencies into their financial systems.

2025-06-11T18:37:38,"20x-leveraged whale bet lifts Bitcoin back above $108K","The anonymous wallet opened the bet on Binance Futures, sparking a short squeeze and reviving bullish sentiment. Is this the Most Daring Bitcoin Move of the Year? A newly funded wallet, '0x1f25,' made one of 2025’s boldest moves—taking a 511.5 BTC position on Hyperliquid using $10M USDC margin and 20x leverage at $106,538 entry, risking liquidation at $88,141. Based on this investment of $54.5 million with 20 times leverage, the whale made a very risky bet by borrowing money to make a much bigger Bitcoin trade than they actually had. This bold move has thrusted Bitcoin upwards, with the apex cryptocurrency being a stone’s throw away from the psychological price of $110,000. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin was hovering around the $109,238 level, representing a 3.3% increase in the past week, according to CoinGecko data . This Bitcoin rally aligns with optimism over US-China trade talks in London, which could ease tech export curbs and boost access to rare earth minerals. Risk assets, including US stocks, surged in response, lifting BTC higher. Bitcoin’s Demand in the U.S. Skyrockets Bitcoin demand in the US is surging, with Coinbase Premium hitting a 4-month high — a clear sign that investor sentiment is turning bullish and the market is heating up. Coinbase Premium is a metric that compares the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase to the price of Bitcoin on other global exchanges, such as Binance. Therefore, a high Coinbase Premium indicates strong buying interest from US-based investors since they’re willing to pay a bit more than the global average to get Bitcoin. What does this mean? Well, US-based investors are increasingly eager to buy Bitcoin, evidenced by them paying higher prices on Coinbase than on other exchanges. This shift in sentiment points to rising enthusiasm and suggests the market could be preparing for a stronger move upward. Meanwhile, a supply shock looms since Bitcoin on crypto exchanges recently hit a 7-year low, which is bullish because of dwindling selling pressure. Bitcoin’s Battle: Will ATH Resistance Become the Next Bullish Launchpad or a Stubborn Barrier?” Having set a new all-time high of $111,814 last month on May 22, Bitcoin stands just shy of this level at $109,238. Whether it can flip $112K into support depends on its ability to hold $106K–107K on pullbacks, combined with a dovish U.S. macro backdrop. Should these align, Bitcoin may not only breach $112K again but sustain higher levels—potentially eyeing the $120K zone next. But failure to secure these key levels risks reversing into a broader correction, with $100K or deeper revisits becoming likely. Technical structure, on‑chain strength, and institutional interest all favor bulls, but macro economics and pattern risks caution against assuming victory. The $103–112 K range is critical because if Bitcoin holds and flips, it opens the door to new highs. Conclusion At $109,238, Bitcoin seems to be in a consolidation phase, often called the ”calm before the storm” needed to elevate it past the $112,000 zone. This might be the reason why the anyonymous whale made a 20x leverage bet, expecting the leading cryptocurrency to make a new ATH soon. As investor sentiment skyrockets led by those on American soil, time will tell how BTC plays out in the short term as fingers remain crossed on whether a breach past $112K is in the offing.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9537/20x-leveraged-whale-bet-lifts-bitcoin-back-above-108-k,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|ZRX","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T18:33:03,"Europe’s Bitcoin Ambitions Grow as Blockchain Group Plans $340M Treasury Boost","Paris-based Blockchain Group is making a strong push into Bitcoin, with plans to raise $340 million to grow its crypto holdings. The move is one of the boldest yet by a European firm, and it signals that institutional interest in Bitcoin isn’t limited to the U.S. Blockchain Group already holds more than $154 million in BTC, but this new raise would more than double its treasury, positioning the company as a key player in the European crypto space. Unsplash The way they’re raising funds sets them apart. Modeled after the At-The-Market (ATM) approach seen in U.S. financial markets, the company will sell shares directly at market prices in controlled tranches. Instead of unloading all the shares at once, they’ll be released gradually based on pricing limits that include the higher of the previous day’s close or the average market price, and capped at 21% of that day’s trading volume. That makes it a flexible, cautious way to fund expansion without shaking up the stock price. It’s not just about holding more Bitcoin, but it’s about treating Bitcoin as a central financial strategy. With that in mind, Blockchain Group has teamed up with TOBAM, a well-known asset manager in France. TOBAM will manage the capital raise and guide the incoming funds into growth-focused plans. This kind of structured, institutional cooperation hasn’t been common in the European crypto scene, but it reflects a growing belief that Bitcoin can be a serious long-term asset, not just a bet on price. You can see similar shifts in consumer-facing markets, too, with crypto now being used in a variety of everyday settings, such as online casinos, where this crypto usage helps to ensure players’ data privacy as well as faster withdrawal speeds of winnings. (Source: https://www.pokerstrategy.com/online-casinos/bitcoin-casinos/ ) Bitcoin is becoming a practical currency option, not just a speculative store of value. When Bitcoin starts popping up in places where people actually spend money, it helps support the idea that it’s something that could stick, and not just a trend for traders. This approach is part of a broader strategic plan laid out by Blockchain Group leadership. Alexandre Laizet, the company’s deputy CEO and head of Bitcoin operations, has been upfront about the direction they’re heading. He sees the ATM raise not just as a way to buy more Bitcoin but as a tool to grow beyond European markets. According to Laizet, the company isn’t chasing the market because it’s focused on results and using Bitcoin as a long-term source of value. Valentin Kosanovic, another executive, echoed that sentiment. He called the move a major leap in the company’s global strategy and stressed their dedication to Bitcoin as a core business driver. That’s a potential signal that Blockchain Group is aiming to build a sustained presence in the space and not just grab headlines or chase short-term gains. The timing of this announcement is interesting, too. Just days before they put it out, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, called MicroStrategy , unveiled plans to raise $1 billion to expand its own BTC holdings. While Blockchain Group’s raise is smaller, it carries weight because of what it represents: Europe’s entrance into a field that’s largely been dominated by U.S. players. Strategy currently holds more than 2.7% of the total Bitcoin supply, valued at over $61 billion. Blockchain Group isn’t at that level yet, but this new raise brings them closer to that conversation. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have been seeing net outflows. Over $47 million left those funds on June 6 alone, marking a second straight day of selling. Despite that, firms like Blockchain Group are pressing ahead. They’re not reacting to short-term market dips. They’re acting on what they see as a long-term opportunity. Analysts say this kind of treasury-based accumulation is a bullish sign . It shows that some institutions believe the future of Bitcoin doesn’t rest on day-to-day price swings. After hitting an all-time high of $111,814 on May 22, Bitcoin has been consolidating. Still, many in the industry are pointing to the lack of forced selling or leveraged blowouts as a sign of stability. Blockchain Group’s move fits into that narrative. Rather than panic during a cooldown, they’re buying. And they’re doing it through careful, structured raises that aim to protect their balance sheet while strengthening their position in crypto. Unsplash While a lot of attention still focuses on North America, Europe is starting to play catch-up. And if Blockchain Group’s strategy pays off, it could mark a turning point. The company is putting itself in a position not just to grow, but to lead. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-11T18:25:40,"Financial Advisors Remain Hesitant Towards Bitcoin — But Won’t Be for Long","Almost a year and a half after bitcoin BTC spot exchange-traded funds were unleashed upon the U.S. financial system, financial advisors are still trying to wrap their heads around crypto. That’s according to Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at crypto asset manager Hashdex. “The overwhelming majority of financial advisors in particular are not recommending an allocation to bitcoin or crypto to their clients at this point,” O’Shea told CoinDesk in an interview. “Of course, there are some out there that have been very proactively thinking about this space and getting their clients exposure to it, but that's really a small subset of the overall market,"" he added. ""Most of what we've been doing in the last few years is based around education."" Advisors are receptive to all of this, O’Shea said — it’s simply that due diligence takes a while, and that they move relatively slowly. In other words, these are still very early days in terms of advisors recommending crypto exposure to their clients. Their questions have moved beyond trying to understand what bitcoin or blockchain is, and now focus more on the role that digital assets can play in someone’s portfolio, according to O’Shea. Should it be seen as an equity allocation? Should it replace gold? General scepticism towards the asset class as a whole tends to be confined to older generations of financial advisors. At the top of the list of concerns is volatility. Advisors may be aware that bitcoin is a developing asset with a 16-year track record, but at the end of the day, they may still struggle to stomach the currency’s regular 20% or more declines. Anxieties about bitcoin’s energy consumption — which were big enough in 2021 for Tesla to stop receiving bitcoin payments — have somewhat receded to second place, O’Shea said. In fact, the narrative around proof-of-work seems to have changed significantly in the last few months, he noted, with people increasingly appreciating that bitcoin mining can help develop renewable energy projects. Coming in third is criminality. Bitcoin is still often seen, even by members of Congress, as a payment system that facilitates drug dealers and sanctions evaders. Financial advisors still bring this up as a point of concern, O’Shea said. For him, there are two main themes in 2025 when it comes to digital assets: bitcoin and stablecoins. And while it isn’t as straightforward to gain exposure to the growth of the stablecoin market, he stated that smart contract platforms such as Ethereum and Solana — which provide the infrastructure for stablecoins to function — should become interesting to investors. “There is certainly real utility for these platforms. A lot of people refer to stable coins as the first killer app, right? Because it's something that intuitively people can understand,” O’Shea said. In any case, the hesitation around bitcoin won’t last forever, he predicted. “These folks are under-appreciating how developed this ecosystem is, and how beneficial an allocation to this asset class can be over the longer term,” he said. “Even by the end of the year, there'll be a lot more that appreciate that fact.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/11/financial-advisors-are-still-hesitant-towards-bitcoin-but-wont-be-for-long,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET","Markets|Bitcoin|Wall Street|Hashdex|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-11T18:14:43,"Bitcoin Poised For Rally To $1 Million, Says Michael Saylor — Here’s What Will Catalyze The Epic Ascent","Michael Saylor, cofounder and the executive chairman of Bitcoin-powered giant Strategy, has ruled out the chances of a full-blown crypto winter returning, at least not anytime soon. Crypto winter, as widely known within the cryptosphere, is a period typically characterized by a cruel correction in Bitcoin prices. According to Saylor, BTC is not going to $0 but is headed towards the $1 million per coin coveted milestone based on a number of key factors that he believes will supercharge the price of the oldest cryptocurrency. Price Has To Rocket If $50 Million In Bitcoin Is Bought Daily Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Michael Saylor highlighted that roughly 450 Bitcoin (BTC) are minted by miners every day. At current Bitcoin prices of $109,559 as per CoinGecko, that amount is equivalent to around $50 million. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” Saylor posited. The Bitcoin bull further noted that the increasing number of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is buying “the entire natural supply.” Saylor’s software intelligence-turned Bitcoin Treasury firm Strategy has amassed 582,000 BTC since it started purchasing in 2020, which is valued at around $63.59 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” Notably, Saylor acknowledged that if Bitcoin surges to $500,000 or $1 million, it may be more realistic to expect it to fall by about $200,000 a coin. Trump Endorsement Another Key Tailwind According to Saylor, there are enough confirmations in the wider economy to support his all-or-nothing prediction for Bitcoin. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” the Strategy co-founder quipped. Saylor also pointed out that US President Trump’s backing of Bitcoin and his efforts to create a more friendly regulatory environment will buoy the asset’s uptrend. Meanwhile, traditional banks have started to leverage this improving regulatory scene to foray into the fast-growing market, as they prepare to provide BTC custody services. Growing Institutional Bitcoin Adoption He further pointed out that demand for the scarce asset is going through the roof. For instance, BlackRock and other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers and nation states are buying up Bitcoin daily. Bilal Bin Saqib, head of Pakistan’s crypto council, recently disclosed that the country is set to create its own United States-esque strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor described the growing demand for Bitcoin as a “digital gold rush,” suggesting the top crypto has “gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected.” It’s worth mentioning that Saylor is not the only uber-bullish pundit in the crypto market. As ZyCrypto previously reported , asset manager ARK Invest bumped its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, bolstered mainly by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as “digital gold.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-poised-for-rally-to-1-million-says-michael-saylor-heres-what-will-catalyze-the-epic-ascent/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare

Here Are Expert Opinions","With inflation in the US remaining below expectations, the Bitcoin (BTC) price remained stable in the $110,000 band. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May increased by 2.4% on an annual basis, while headline inflation rose for the first time since January, while the overall inflation trend continued to slow. Core inflation remained stable at 2.8%. Financial markets showed limited reaction to the data, with Bitcoin trading in the $109,600-$110,100 range, while U.S. stocks continued their volatile course with a slight increase. Nansen Chief Research Analyst Aurelie Barthere said the current data will have limited impact on the market. “This data is not expected to create a strong movement in the markets,” Barthere said, arguing that US-China trade talks have become a more important macro factor. “The progress or setbacks in these talks could be decisive for risk assets.” Related News: Caution: Well-known app Accused of Seizing Cryptocurrency from Users Who Have Not Moved Their Assets for a Year Ahead of the CPI data, President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that a new tariff agreement between the US and China has been completed and only formalities remain. Trump also called on the Fed to cut interest rates by a full percentage point. Nic Puckrin, founder of Coin Bureau, said that falling inflation and “exaggerated” tariff concerns could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates. “I expect inflation to continue to trend downward throughout the year. This could give the Fed confidence to cut interest rates,” Puckrin said, adding that this could trigger Bitcoin’s final bullish phase of this cycle. “With almost half of the year behind us, the inflation monster still remains in its cage despite all the pessimistic forecasts,” he added. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T18:11:32,"Trump Family-Backed American Bitcoin Has Scooped Up $23 Million Worth Of Bitcoin","American Bitcoin, Hut 8’s majority-owned Bitcoin-mining unit backed by the Trump family, has accumulated 215 BTC since its launch in April, according to a recent disclosure from the company to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the June 6 SEC filing, the digital asset mining firm revealed it was holding 215 Bitcoin in its reserves as of May 31. Based on current prices, the stash is worth $23.6 million. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin was changing hands at $109,605 at publication time . This marks the company’s first sizable Bitcoin acquisition since announcing a Bitcoin treasury play, pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy — which started accumulating BTC in 2020. American Data Center, owned by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., merged with Bitcoin mining company Hut8 to form American Bitcoin in March. The Trump brothers own 20% of American Bitcoin, while Hut 8 holds the remaining 80%. The newly established entity plans to go public as early as the third financial quarter of this year through a stock-for-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining and will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ABTC. “ABTC considers its reserve a core strategic asset, managed adaptively to support balance sheet strength with a view to enhancing long-term stockholder value. Bitcoin accumulation is not a side effect of ABTC’s business. It is the business,” the firm said. The company added that its accumulation strategy is open-ended, suggesting that it has no fixed BTC target. Instead, it will continuously assess market conditions to raise capital when favorable and boost its holdings of the foremost cryptocurrency. American Bitcoin’s strategy to grow its Bitcoin stash comes as a slew of public and private companies increasingly add the asset to their corporate treasuries. Companies including Trump Media , GameStop , and Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain became the latest to announce or advance their Bitcoin treasuries, joining the likes of Semler Scientific , Cantor-backed Twenty One , and Metaplanet .

2025-06-11T18:05:41,"Paul Tudor Jones Warns US in a ‘Debt Trap,’ Says Bitcoin Part of ‘Ideal’ Portfolio Strategy To Fight Incoming Inflation","Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones says the US is now “fiscally constrained,” which may call for a specific investment strategy in the coming years. In a new interview on Bloomberg Television, the Tudor Investment Corporation founder says that the US government is in a debt trap, and will need to run negative real rates – or set interest rates lower than the rate of inflation, in order to devalue its debt. Jones says that the “playbook is clear” as far as what the government is going to need to do, giving an edge to investors looking to position themselves. Besides stocks, he mentions Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold as portfolio staples moving forward. “We’re going to have negative real rates and that’s why you have to think about what is facing our policy makers in this debt trap as you construct your portfolio. So, what would an ideal portfolio be in something like that? Well, what has worked so far? What has worked so far has been some combination of stocks – which won’t do great, which would do terribly if they called us out on the bond market… But it would be some combination of probably volatility-adjusted Bitcoin, gold, stocks. That’s probably your best portfolio to fight inflation.” The investor also said he believes that President Trump will attempt to install a new Fed Chair who is “uber dovish” in order to get rates down and achieve the desired market environment. At time of writing, both BTC and gold are just slightly below their all-time highs.

According to unanimous decisions in both its House and Senate , Connecticut passed a bill this week that blocks any part of the state's government from an ability to ""purchase, hold, invest in or establish a reserve of virtual currency,"" and it also prohibits accepting crypto payments. This runs counter to efforts in states such as New Hampshire and Texas , which are moving toward establishing reserves that echo the intent of President Donald Trump's administration at the federal level. The lawmakers in Connecticut, which ranks in the middle of the pack among state economies, also tightened rules for crypto firms working under the state's money-transmitter license. After Trump issued an order to his administration in March to establish a reserve of bitcoin BTC, a long list of states jumped toward similar actions, though many of them were stymied by opposition or expiring legislative windows. New Hampshire was the first to cross the finish line. Texas has a similar bill awaiting a signature from Governor Greg Abbott, and Arizona also approved a more modest approach to setting aside unclaimed digital assets in a reserve. ""As legislative sessions wrap up across the country, we’re proud of the incredible momentum behind pro-Bitcoin and digital asset legislation,"" said Dennis Porter, the founder of the Satoshi Action Fund that's been advocating for state lawmakers to establish reserves. ""Unfortunately, Connecticut has chosen to reject this opportunity—for now. But we remain optimistic. As more states embrace Bitcoin and see the benefits firsthand, we’re confident Connecticut will follow suit."" Porter said North Carolina and Ohio are both still a possibility for reserves this year. The federal government hasn't yet moved assets into a reserve. The relevant agencies, led by the Department of the Treasury, have been seeking to account for all of the digital assets held in various corners of the public sector. Once complete, Trump had directed all existing crypto be set aside as a long-term investment but that no taxpayer money be spent to acquire anything more than the government has seized in civil and criminal matters. Bo Hines, one of Trump's top crypto advisers, said at Consensus 2025 in Toronto that there are a lot of ideas on the table for acquiring more bitcoin in budget-neutral ways. In other state crypto legislative matters, California's lawmakers have been working on legislation that could allow digital assets payments in a state pilot program. The bill passed unanimously in its House and was forwarded to the Senate last week.

2025-06-11T18:00:00,"Torn Between Pepe and Pepeto? Here’s Why Pepeto Could Be the Hottest Token This Summer","In the crypto space, it is common knowledge that altcoins tend to spark activity once Bitcoin gains upward momentum. And right now, two meme coins keep popping up: Pepe and Pepeto. Pepe had its big moment, but now Pepeto is stealing the spotlight with its innovative ecosystem and a presale that’s already raising millions. Just think of Pepeto as an improved version of Pepe, not a copycat. If you missed Pepe’s debut rise last year, you might have another chance with Pepeto. What Makes Pepeto Stand Out? If you’re familiar with the cryptocurrency space, you’ll know that Pepe was the king of meme-coins. However, Pepeto rose to fix some of its problems. Unlike Pepe, which has unlimited coins, Pepeto burns 5% of every transaction, making the remaining coins more valuable over time. Additionally, Pepeto isn’t just a meme; it’s building a play-to-earn game with NFT rewards, so it has real-world use. Imagine it this way: Pepe = Fun meme, but no plans after the hype. Pepeto = Fun meme plus games, rewards, and an innovative ecosystem to keep growing. Pepeto’s Presale: Why’s Everyone Talking About It? The Pepeto presale has been gaining momentum for several months, and savvy investors are jumping in early as it gradually nears its end. Right now, you can purchase Pepeto tokens for $0.000000133 each. However, this price won’t last long, as the presale has already raised over $5.3 million, indicating that people believe in this project. From observation, these are three big things that make Pepeto special: The price goes up at every stage Major exchanges like KuCoin will list it soon Players can earn tokens by playing the new mobile game A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 From these observations, Pepeto could blow up the same way Pepe did, but with even better features. Currently, they’re burning tokens (making yours more valuable) and creating NFT rewards. And the best part? You’re getting in before everyone else. Once the presale ends and it hits big exchanges, early buyers could see massive gains. Don’t wait. Join the presale now. Why It’s Time for The Pepe Legacy to Move On Pepe the Frog was the meme coin king of 2023, as it shocked everyone with its incredible rise. At its all-time high, early investors made life-changing profits. However, here’s the truth about Pepe today: The significant gains have already happened- Pepe’s price is now 70% below its all-time high Whales control too much- Just 5% of holders own 60% of all coins No real utility- It’s just a meme with no games, rewards, or plans Pepe proved that meme coins could explode, and as a result, big traders saw this as an avenue to manipulate prices. The token has an unlimited supply (no burns), and the developers have moved on to new projects. Pepe had its moment, but investors are now looking for the next opportunity, one with actual growth potential. That’s exactly what Pepeto offers, which is all the viral energy of early Pepe but with smart tokenomics and real use cases. Click here to join the presale. About Pepeto Pepeto is the future of meme coins, as it combines viral fun with real utility. Unlike standard meme tokens, Pepto features automatic token burns (5% of every transaction) to increase scarcity over time. The project is developing a play-to-earn mobile game and an NFT rewards system, providing holders with opportunities to earn beyond just trading. Founded by experienced Web3 developers, the Pepeto team is entirely public and has passed security audits. Pepeto’s goal is to create a meme coin that lasts, not just pumps and dumps. With upcoming major exchange listings and an active community, Pepeto aims to be the meme coin of summer 2025.

2025-06-11T17:47:38,"Pepe price due for a healthy pullback after 30% rally","Pepe has seen a sharp 30% rally after establishing a significant market low at the recent swing point. While momentum remains bullish, the memecoin is now approaching a major confluence of resistance that could prompt a temporary correction before further upside continuation. Pepe’s ( PEPE ) recent rally has been impressive, posting a clean 30% gain off a well-defined swing low. However, price is now testing a critical resistance cluster, which includes the point of control (POC), a high-timeframe horizontal resistance, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level from the previous decline. This area is technically significant and often associated with distribution or profit-taking zones. Key technical points 30% Rally from Swing Low: PEPE has rebounded strongly from a key support, marking a potential trend shift. Major Resistance Confluence Ahead: Price is now testing the POC, 0.618 Fibonacci, and high-timeframe resistance zone. Correction May Be Healthy: A rejection here would align with normal bullish structure, potentially forming a higher low. PEPEUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView From a technical perspective, the area PEPE is entering now acts as a natural resistance zone, where buyers may begin to slow down and profit-taking could emerge. This resistance band is reinforced by: The point of control, where the most volume has traded historically, A macro 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, a key reversal level in trending markets, And a high-timeframe horizontal resistance, which previously capped bullish momentum. Given the strength of the recent move, a pullback would be considered healthy, particularly if it results in a higher low forming near the last major breakout level. This would reinforce the current bullish structure and set the stage for a sustainable rally in the next leg up. You might also like: ADA, TON surge expose market weakness; BlockDAG’s X1 app sets new record with 1.5M users However, if the bullish momentum is particularly strong, there is still a chance PEPE breaks above this resistance cluster. In that case, bulls will need to push through the value area high, which would confirm a new swing high and shift the short-term outlook decisively in favor of continued upside. Until then, this region remains a critical decision zone where price must prove whether bulls are in full control, or if a rotation lower is required before the next leg. What to expect in the coming price action PEPE is now at a major crossroads. If bulls fail to break through the POC–0.618 resistance zone, a pullback toward high-timeframe support is the most likely outcome. This would allow for a healthy retest and potential higher low, keeping the uptrend intact. A breakout, however, would signal accelerating strength and continuation toward new highs.

However, the meme coin appears to have lost momentum, failing to rally alongside recent bullish trends that pushed Bitcoin ( BTC ) past the $110,000 mark before a slight pullback. TRUMP’s performance Following the dinner announcement, TRUMP occasionally outperformed the broader crypto market, boosted by aggressive whale accumulation. To this end, some whales recorded massive profits and losses while trading TRUMP . The dinner was a reward for the top 220 TRUMP holders, who collectively spent over $100 million to secure seats.

2025-06-11T17:25:14,"Bitcoin w rezerwie USA, a Bitcoin Hyper przyspiesza jego rozwój","Stany Zjednoczone oficjalnie rozpoczęły budowę Rezerwy Strategicznej Bitcoina, a Bitcoin Hyper($HYPER) wspiera rozwój warstwy drugiej króla kryptowalut. Nowa struktura powstała z inicjatywy administracji Donalda Trumpa, która zdecydowała się wykorzystać skonfiskowane środki w celu zabezpieczenia cyfrowych aktywów. Ten ruch nie wynika z przypadku. Z danych udostępnionych przez Gemini i Glassnode wynika, że ponad 30% całkowitej podaży BTC znajduje się w rękach scentralizowanych podmiotów. Wśród nich są fundusze ETF, giełdy kryptowalut, przedsiębiorstwa oraz rządy. W raporcie podkreślono, że zaangażowanie instytucji publicznych może mieć istotny wpływ na rozwój rynku. Każdy dolar wprowadzony przez państwowy kapitał przekłada się na wzrost wartości rynkowej w wysokości 25 dolarów. Co więcej, generuje 1,70 dolara trwałego wzrostu wartości sieci. Tego typu wpływ sygnalizuje coraz większe znaczenie strategicznych rezerw w świecie cyfrowych aktywów. Nowy sygnał dla inwestorów długoterminowych Bitcoin przestaje być kojarzony wyłącznie z aktywem spekulacyjnym. Wzrost liczby zasobów przenoszonych z giełd do niezależnych depozytariuszy wskazuje na proces konsolidacji. Zmienność kursu uległa zmniejszeniu, co ułatwia planowanie inwestycji w dłuższym horyzoncie. Obecne cykle rynkowe nie przypominają już gwałtownych skoków i spadków. Sprawdź, jak kupić Bitcoina. Źródło: CoinMarketCap Zamiast tego charakteryzują się spokojniejszymi, bardziej stabilnymi wzrostami. Rezerwa Strategiczna działa nie tylko jako narzędzie ochrony wartości. Stanowi również dowód na to, że państwa zaczynają włączać kryptowaluty do swoich modeli zarządzania finansami. Dla inwestorów oznacza to zwiększoną pewność, a także nowe formy zaangażowania kapitału instytucjonalnego. Zjawisko to może wpłynąć na dalsze umacnianie pozycji Bitcoina w globalnym systemie finansowym. Bitcoin Hyper – nowa warstwa funkcjonalności Pomimo coraz większej akceptacji ze strony instytucji, główna sieć Bitcoina długo pozostawała ograniczona w zakresie możliwości technologicznych. Sytuacja ta zmienia się dzięki projektowi Bitcoin Hyper. W ciągu pięciu dni sprzedaż tokena $HYPER przekroczyła milion dolarów. Sprawdź też najlepsze kryptowaluty poniżej 1 dolara. To efekt rosnącego zapotrzebowania na rozwiązania, które rozszerzają funkcjonalność Bitcoina bez naruszania jego podstawowych zasad bezpieczeństwa. Bitcoin Hyper to druga warstwa Bitcoina zbudowana na maszynie wirtualnej Solany, która działa w połączeniu z bazową warstwą BTC. Taka konstrukcja pozwala uzyskać ponad 2 tysiące transakcji na sekundę, zachowując przy tym odporność na manipulacje oraz decentralizację. Użytkownicy mogą realizować szybkie przelewy, korzystać z aplikacji zdecentralizowanych, a także uczestniczyć w nowych formach aktywności, takich jak staking czy zdecentralizowany handel. Mechanizm działania sieci Bitcoin Hyper System opiera się na transparentnym modelu. Użytkownik deponuje BTC w inteligentnym kontrakcie, który weryfikuje transakcję na podstawie danych z łańcucha bloków. Następnie sieć emituje równoważny token, możliwy do wykorzystania w ekosystemie Bitcoin Hyper($HYPER) . Po zakończeniu aktywności użytkownik może spalić token i odzyskać oryginalne BTC. W tle działają dowody zerowej wiedzy oraz weryfikacja danych przez light clients. Użytkownik przesyła bitcoiny do inteligentnego kontraktu, który potwierdza transakcję na podstawie danych z sieci głównej. Po weryfikacji powstaje równoważny token w sieci Hyper, gotowy do dalszego wykorzystania. Kiedy użytkownik chce wycofać środki, token zostaje unieważniony, a oryginalne Bitcoiny wracają do właściciela. Cały proces odbywa się z użyciem zaawansowanych metod kryptograficznych, które zapewniają bezpieczeństwo i zgodność z głównym łańcuchem bez konieczności angażowania pośredników. Właściciele tokena $HYPER mogą korzystać z produktów o podwyższonym zwrocie, zyskać dostęp do zaawansowanych narzędzi oraz uczestniczyć w dalszym rozwoju projektu. Twórcy aplikacji mają szansę uzyskać dofinansowanie i zwroty kosztów opłat sieciowych, jeśli zdecydują się wykorzystywać $HYPER w swoich kontraktach. Dane z rynku potwierdzają skuteczność modelu Bitcoin Hyper Podobne projekty już wcześniej osiągały znaczące wyniki. Arbitrum zgromadziło ponad 13 miliardów dolarów wartości zablokowanej oraz ponad milion aktywnych portfeli. Sieć Base, powiązana z Coinbase, przekroczyła wartość 2,5 miliarda dolarów i notuje ponad milion aktywnych adresów dziennie. Dane te to dowód na to, że dobrze zaprojektowane sieci drugiej warstwy mogą szybko zdobywać rynek i użytkowników. Bitcoin Hyper ma potencjał, żeby powtórzyć ten sukces i stać się jedną z najlepszych przedsprzedaży kryptowalut . Całkowita podaż tokenów została ustalona na 21 miliardów, bez alokacji dla uprzywilejowanych grup. Obecnie trwa przedsprzedaż tokena $HYPER, a jeden z większych inwestorów nabył niedawno tokeny za równowartość 55 tysięcy dolarów. Tego rodzaju ruchy ze strony dużych graczy często prognozują większe zmiany. Nowa rola Bitcoina w cyfrowym świecie Rozwój Rezerwy Strategicznej oraz wdrożenie sieci Hyper to dwa bieguny tej samej zmiany. Z jednej strony widać instytucjonalizację zasobów cyfrowych. Z drugiej pojawiają się narzędzia, które poszerzają zakres ich użycia. Bitcoin przestaje pełnić jedynie funkcję przechowywania wartości. Staje się środowiskiem operacyjnym dla całych aplikacji, usług i produktów nowej generacji. Bitcoin Hyper wnosi do sieci Bitcoina funkcjonalność, której dotąd brakowało. Dzięki nowej warstwie technicznej możliwe stają się szybkie transakcje, obsługa aplikacji finansowych, zdecentralizowanych projektów i rozwiązań opartych na inteligentnych kontraktach. Sieć zyskuje skalę, której wymaga nowoczesna gospodarka cyfrowa. Bitcoin nie pełni już wyłącznie roli cyfrowego magazynu wartości. W połączeniu z Bitcoin Hyper przechodzi transformację w platformę operacyjną dla szerszego ekosystemu finansowego. Może wspierać codzienne zastosowania, przepływy kapitału, tworzenie nowych usług oraz rozwiązań dla użytkowników i firm.

2025-06-11T17:24:10,"Why analysts highly suggest to bet on RUVI as BTC’s rise ushers altcoin season","Bitcoin’s recent resurgence has sent ripples of excitement across the cryptocurrency market, signaling the emergence of an altcoin season. Historically, Bitcoin’s climb has paved the way for exponential growth in altcoins, as investors diversify their portfolios in search of the next big opportunity. Among the many options available, analysts are increasingly pointing to Ruvi AI as a standout choice for investors ready to capitalize on this trend. Backed by tangible use cases, a highly successful presale, and promising growth potential, Ruvi AI has all the makings of the next big name in crypto. Bitcoin’s influence and the dawn of altcoin season Bitcoin’s price movements often set the tone for the broader cryptocurrency market. Its recent rise has not only renewed investor interest but also signaled the start of altcoin season—a period during which alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin in terms of percentage gains. Altcoins typically benefit from the trickle-down effect as investors seek assets with higher growth potential. Ruvi AI, a blockchain-based project driven by artificial intelligence, is emerging as a prime candidate for those looking to ride this wave. With solid fundamentals and an impressive presale performance, it presents a rare opportunity to secure a position in a high-growth asset while its value is still low. Ruvi AI’s presale success captures investor attention Ruvi AI has already proven its appeal through its ongoing presale, having raised $1.7 million and sold over 145 million tokens to enthusiastic investors. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2, Ruvi AI offers a low-cost entry point with immense upside potential. What makes Ruvi AI particularly compelling is its built-in valuation structure. Unlike speculative tokens, Ruvi AI’s $0.07 valuation post-presale is intentionally preplanned, providing clarity and predictability. Analysts predict the token could reach $1 post-listing, signaling a strong return on investment for early adopters.

2025-06-11T17:20:35,"Bitcoin is key to fighting inflation, says billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones","Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones believes the best defense against inflation is a portfolio composed of Bitcoin, gold, and equities. In an interview with Bloomberg, the founder of Tudor Investment Corp. described this mix, adjusted for volatility, as the ideal hedge in what he sees as a persistently inflationary era. Jones said policymakers will likely continue to run “hot” economies by keeping real interest rates below inflation to manage mounting debt.

He also warned that such policies only work “until the population throws you out,” referencing similar dynamics in Japan. In that environment, Jones explained, assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold become critical as stores of value. While he previously advocated for a 1–2% Bitcoin allocation, Jones now emphasizes the broader case for owning the digital asset, though he declined to cite a specific percentage. Given Bitcoin’s higher volatility compared to gold, Jones recommended adjusting allocations accordingly. “That’s probably your best portfolio to fight inflation,” he said. Jones also speculated that, if re-elected, President Trump would appoint an “uber-dovish” Federal Reserve chair after Jerome Powell’s term ends, potentially accelerating these inflationary dynamics.

2025-06-11T17:20:20,"BitFuFu: Q1 Was A Strategic Reset, But Hashrate Rebound Signals A Stronger Q2 Ahead","Summary BitFuFu faced a sharp Q1 revenue and capacity decline, but operational recovery and hashrate expansion post-Q1 signal a positive turnaround. Cloud mining remains BitFuFu’s dominant revenue source, with registered users nearly doubling YoY to over 607,000 users, signaling growing retail demand despite infrastructure lag. BitFuFu's close ties with BITMAIN offer hardware procurement advantages but pose related-party and concentration risks, though liquidity remains healthy for now. Despite recent setbacks, BitFuFu’s infrastructure recovery, improving efficiency, and growth in cloud user base, point to a stronger Q2 and support my continued Buy rating for FUFU shares. BitFuFu (NASDAQ: FUFU ) is one of the new entrant publicly traded Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining companies in the current crypto market cycle. BitFuFu has grown in popularity since going public in March last year thanks to the company’s cloud mining segment, which makes Bitcoin mining more accessible to a larger audience. The company is headquartered in Singapore and has close ties with Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing giant BITMAIN. The founder and CEO of the company, Leo Lu, commands extensive experience in the crypto mining business, having headed the cloud mining division at BITMAIN for several years before going on to found BitFuFu in December 2020. Several other key members of BitFuFu’s team were former members of BITMAIN and Bitdeer ( BTDR ). BitFuFu’s long-standing relationship with BITMAIN gives an edge in securing cutting-edge mining hardware, but it also poses potential related party risks (which I’ll discuss down the line in this article). BitFuFu's operational and financial performance last year was impressive. FY24 was both an operational breakout year and an inflection point for BitFuFu, with revenue surging by 63.1% compared to FY23 and net income skyrocketing 414.3% compared to FY23. Revenue for the full-year FY24 was $463.3 million and net income was $54 million. I covered the FY24 earnings review in a previous article published here on Seeking Alpha in March this year. Reference to FY24 is necessary for an insight into the Q1 FY25 earnings and the outlook for the remaining quarters of FY25. BitFuFu Q1 FY25 results were announced last week. It was a mix of positives and negatives, with headwinds impacting top-line performance, yet underlying operational trends suggest that the company might be undergoing strategic adaptation and still showing ongoing resilience despite the headwinds faced. Virtually every miner that has reported earnings so far in 2025 has experienced headwinds that are cutting across the board. A first peek at BitFuFu’s Q1 results might suggest that FY25 is shaping up so far to be quite not like FY24. Since tariffs and macroeconomic shifts, the crypto market has been grappling with volatility. But putting volatility and Bitcoin price aside, let’s examine BitFuFu’s Q1 operational performance so far this year in this piece. FUFU has been on a nosedive since the start of the year. And on the heels of the Q1 results, the pressing question for investors is whether FUFU still presents a compelling investment opportunity in Bitcoin mining. Data by YCharts What BitFuFu FY25 Is Shaping Up To Be BitFuFu’s Q1 results must have been an unwelcome surprise for most investors following last year's stellar financial performance. The YoY decline was pronounced across the board. BitFuFu saw revenue decline in Q1 by 46% YoY. Revenue fell from $144.4 million in the same period last year to $78 million in Q1. Net loss was $16.9 million, compared to net income of $35.3 million in Q1 FY24. A breakdown of revenue shows cloud mining still holds a dominant position in the company’s operations at 68.8% of total revenue in Q1. Self-mining accounted for 22.5%, while the sale of mining equipment and other segments contributed about 8.7% of total revenue. Growth on the cloud mining side shows nearly a 100% increase in the past year, with the number of registered users growing from ~321,000 users in Q1 last year to over 607,000 users in Q1 this year. The growth in registered cloud mining users did not offset the revenue decline, though. BitFuFu attributed the decrease in financial performance to several factors, including last year's April Bitcoin halving event, an increase in blockchain network difficulty (as a result of the halving), and the temporary decrease in the company's hashrate under management in Q1. I think some of the justifications from management for the decrease in financial numbers are somewhat debatable. The halving event was over a year ago, and miners have ramped up capacity to compensate for the reduced block rewards. Moreover, the Bitcoin price has increased nearly 70% since the halving. The ~70% increase in the value of each Bitcoin mined is more than substantial enough to greatly offset, if not entirely negate, the impact of halved block rewards. I, therefore, believe that still blaming the halving in Q1 2025 is much about an attempt at deflection. I’d focus on operational factors as the main cause of BitFuFu's production and financial decline in Q1. I believe the decline in BitFuFu’s mining capacity (hashrate) and electricity capacity in Q1 (as reported by the company) were the main driving factors responsible for the decline in Bitcoin production and revenue in Q1. Operational metrics (BitFuFu form 6-K) While BitFuFu nearly doubled its cloud mining users compared to Q1 last year, the growth came at a time when total hashrate and power capacity declined sharply. This result is a telling disconnect between demand and supply. Without the infrastructure to match rising demand, revenue per user likely fell, which explains why cloud mining’s dominant share of revenue (68.8%) wasn’t enough to prevent the steep top-line decline. BitFuFu’s power capacity declined from 644 MW to 478 MW YoY, which was a 26% decline. Hashrate under management declined by 28% from 28.6 EH/s in Q1 FY24 to 20.6 EH/s in Q1 this year. Sequentially, their hashrate under management also decreased by 12.3% from 23.5 EH/s in Q4 FY4 to 20.6 EH/s in Q1 FY25, while power capacity declined sequentially by 13.3% from Q4 FY24 to Q1 FY25. I’ve pointed out the sequential capacity contraction to show that BitFuFu’s operational capacity contraction is more than just a seasonal or cyclical variation but rather reflects an ongoing operational slowdown. Moving beyond Q1, there has been some turnaround in the capacity drop at BitFuFu which was caused by expired hashrate procurement contracts, and disruptions from supplier miner fleet relocations and upgrades in Q1. BitFuFu has reported a strong recovery in capacity post-Q1, with hashrate rebounding to 28.3 EH/s as of April 30 , driven by expanded supplier partnerships and increased hash power procurement; power capacity also increased to 566 MW in April. Hashrate further increased by 20.5% to 34.1 EH/s as of May 31, while power capacity increased another 15% sequentially from April’s 566 MW to 651 MW as of May 31. Notably, much of the hashrate added is from the latest generation Antminer S21 miners deployed in May, translating to more efficiency in improving cost structure per BTC produced and maintaining competitiveness against rising mining difficulty. BitFuFu recorded an average fleet efficiency of 19.1 J/Th in May. A breakdown of BitFuFu’s hashrate composition in May tells more about BitFuFu’s asset-light ongoing business model and why reduced capacity in some quarters might be a necessary adjustment as cloud demand outstrips supply and vice versa. Of the 34.1 EH/s hashrate under management in May, 29.9 EH/s of the hashrate were from third-party hosts, while 4.2 EH/s were from its own facilities. It’s worth mentioning that the hashrate from third-party can be used flexibly by BitFuFu for both self-mining and cloud-mining services as overall demand dictates. BitFuFu’s liquidity doesn’t present an immediate concern, considering the drop in capacity and sales already discussed so far. Besides, the company has invested heavily in acquisition and expansion in the past year. BitFuFu’s BTC in treasury increased by 71.2% to 1,835 BTC as of Q1, compared to 1,072 BTC as of Q1 last year. As of May 31 (which is the latest update), BitFuFu held 1,709 BTC, a decrease of 199 BTC from figures reported in the April operations update . I think it is notable to have maintained a substantial increase in BTC held in treasury YoY despite needing to fund operational needs, strategic investments, and working capital requirements, especially during net loss quarters. BitFuFu has had two net loss quarters since Q1 last year — one in Q3 FY24, and the other is the latest in Q1 FY25. Balance sheet [$ ’000] (BitFuFu form 6-K) The balance sheet further paints a picture of a company that is actively expanding and navigating the headwinds that come with the Bitcoin mining business. On the balance sheet, we see notable growth in equipment, showing ongoing infrastructure build-out in Q1 despite the near-term capacity contraction, which further suggests that new hashrate and energy deployments were possibly delayed to later quarters or pending external infrastructure readiness. One line item that raises my eyebrow in the Q1 balance sheet is the sequential high surge in the amount due to related parties, which increased 880% from $1.6 million in Q4 last year to $15.5 million in Q1 this year. Remember, in the brief overview in the intro of this piece, I mentioned BitFuFu’s close ties with mining hardware giant BITMAIN. Some aspects of these ties are financial in nature, and BitFuFu also maintains some operational and service-related dependencies on BITMAIN, and this poses some potential concentration risks, particularly in times of liquidity strain. In BitFuFu’s latest form 20-F filing , BITMAIN is named as “a related party to a shareholder of the Company,” confirming the indirect but material connection, and translates to financial leverage or obligations likely not easily controllable by BitFuFu. We also rely on Bitmain to provide the miner hosting services under certain hosting service cooperation arrangements, through which Bitmain sources a limited number of hosting facilities to host miners and provide services related to maintenance and technical support, electricity, network, and security. These hosting facilities may demand upward adjustments of their service fees, including electricity costs, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. We cannot assure you that it can continue to maintain cooperation with these hosting facilities, or the services provided by these parties always meet the level of quality, efficiency, and timeliness necessary for us to render satisfactory hosting services to our customers. Such hosting facilities may experience interruption or other incidents from time to time and may be unable to provide services to us. We may not be able to obtain alternative hosting facility supplies in a timely manner and/or at commercially viable terms. If we are unable to effectively address these risks, our ability to serve customers will be affected, and our brand image, reputation, and financial performance may be materially and adversely affected. - Excerpt from BitFuFu Form 20-F Related parties transactions [$ ’000] (BitFuFu form 20-F) I’m highlighting these close ties because it is one of the main risks I associate with BitFuFu apart from the broader industry risks associated with Bitcoin mining in general — the risk of constrained negotiations in a business line where favorable terms and flexibility are very crucial. As of Q1, debt to related parties hasn’t posed an immediate risk, as BitFuFu still has enough liquidity to manage obligations. The quick ratio and current ratio in Q1 were 2.3 and 3.03 respectively. BitFuFu is one of the miners that least taps into equity fundraising. Investors have enjoyed a largely undiluted share structure since FUFU went public. Yesterday, BitFuFu announced a new funding plan to raise $150 million through an ATM offering. Investors should watch out for dilution in the near term. How BitFuFu Stack Up to Peers Price-to-Hodl peer comparison (Author) When comparing miners based on how much investors are paying for each dollar of Bitcoin held in treasury, BitFuFu sits in mid-tier at 3.09x Price/HODL. This makes sense as BitFuFu does not pursue a full HODL strategy but liquidates some produced BTC to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives. I believe BitFuFu’s P/HODL is more likely to shrink in the near-to-mid term, and FUFU becoming more attractive if the miner continues to emphasize operational growth, as we've seen with hashrate and power capacity turnaround and the acquisition of the 51 MW data center facility in Oklahoma in Q1 among other growth initiatives. Also, BitFuFu’s balance sheet isn’t so strained that it will need so much ongoing divesting of BTC produced in self-mining. Data by YCharts BitFuFu’s P/S (TTM) at 1.51x remains attractive among mining peers despite the drop in revenue in Q1. Last year’s strength in sales still supports the P/S ratio on a TTM basis. As we have analyzed the factors that influenced the drop in revenue in Q1, BitFuFu’s latest reported 34.1 EH/s (which already surpasses the hashrate guidance for the full year 2025 of 33 EH/s) and recovery of power capacity signals an upside setup for Q2 and a potentially lower P/S when Q2 results are announced, prompting a rerating of the metric if Bitcoin also maintains its current momentum. Despite the headwinds, I’m reiterating a Buy for FUFU here on the operational recovery post-Q1 and the ongoing growth prospects the operational recovery presents.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794137-bitfufu-q1-was-a-strategic-reset-but-hashrate-rebound-signals-a-stronger-q2-ahead?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","BTC-USD|BTDR|FUFUW|FUFU",cryptocompare
