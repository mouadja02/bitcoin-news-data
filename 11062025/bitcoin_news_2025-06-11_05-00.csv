2025-06-11T02:00:09,"Toncoin Heading Toward 40% Breakout, Pattern Could Suggest","An analyst has pointed out how Toncoin (TON) is currently trading inside a Triangle pattern that could potentially set the stage up for a 40% move. Toncoin Has Been Stuck Inside A Triangle On The Daily Timeframe In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that Toncoin has recently been moving inside. The pattern in question is a Triangle from technical analysis (TA), which forms when an asset’s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Defies Bears: Price Nears $108,000 Despite $250M Exchange Inflows The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance in the future, while the lower one is that of support. A breakout of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Triangles in TA. Three popular ones include the Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical variations. The orientation of the trendlines relative to each other defines which type a particular triangular channel falls under. In an Ascending Triangle, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, its consolidation shrinks toward a net upside. The Descending Triangle involves just the opposite case; the upper line is sloped downward while the lower one is flat. The third variation, the Symmetrical Triangle, has its trendlines at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In this pattern, the price’s range tightens to a point in a sideways manner. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Triangle pattern that Toncoin has seemingly been trapped within during the past few months: From the graph, it’s visible that the Triangle that the 1-day price of Toncoin has been following looks similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it’s not a perfect one; there is a slight bias to the downside. The cryptocurrency most recently found support at the lower line and has since climbed toward the midway point between the trendlines. The coin’s price is now not too far from the apex of the pattern. Generally, breakouts become more likely as consolidation becomes tighter, so it’s possible that TON may be approaching one. According to the analyst, a breakout, if it happens, could potentially end up leading to a 40% move for Toncoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative As for which direction a breakout might take the asset in, Symmetrical Triangles usually have both sides at equal probability. Since the Triangle in the current case is slightly angled down, however, an exit below the lower line may be a bit more likely. It now remains to be seen how Toncoin’s price will develop in the coming days and if the pattern will play any role. TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.3, up over 2% in the last seven days.

2025-06-11T01:44:46,"Senator Lummis refers to the IRS’s crypto tax regulations as 'bad tax regulations'","US Senator Cynthia Lummis has called for changes in the current crypto tax policy. Lummis emphasizes that the policy has been tilted against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Lummis said that the Bitcoin mining community is one of the hardest-hit groups due to the proposed provisions, which would endure potentially duplicative taxes and substantial compliance headaches. This interpretation follows Senator Lummis’ X post that says that America’s crypto tax laws disproportionately target Bitcoin and other digital assets. As a long-time advocate, she argued that the current tax laws are a “complete mess,” with the most problems manifested by Bitcoin. Bitcoin and digital assets are being unfairly targeted because of flawed tax rules. We need crypto revisions in reconciliation. — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 10, 2025 She said the cryptocurrency rules must be updated during the reconciliation process to curb that. Senator Lummis refers to the IRS’s crypto tax regulations as ‘bad tax regulations’ Senator Cynthia Lummis stated that Bitcoin and digital assets are wrongly singled out due to bad tax regulations. Though Lummis does not mention them by name, her remarks likely refer to the IRS’s crypto tax reporting rules, particularly those rolled out in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This law took a wide view of “brokers,” placing miners and developers under the same category. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is also called the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This law widened the broker reporting rules in Sections 6045 and 6045A to cover digital assets. This wide-reaching categorization has faced criticism from miners and developers, who have voiced out their claims. According to them, they would be virtually unable to comply with these regulations. The rules force them to report information like names and transaction amounts in their tax filings — information they often do not even have access to. Lummis’ post called on Congress to try to make the rule change on a special amendment vehicle. The pro-Bitcoin senator calls for “crypto changes in reconciliation” to accelerate the amendment process. According to House rules, some tax or spending bills can be approved with a simple majority using reconciliation. Senator Lummis wants to use this method to change the definition of “broker” and bypass bipartisan gridlock. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970 despite regulatory uncertainties People are also worried that the flawed tax code carries the potential for double taxation in the case of miners and participants in decentralized finance (DeFi). This is because Miners get taxed on their block rewards and then again on capital gains when they sell what they own. At the same time, DeFi users could face several taxable events even if they have not made any profits. However, despite such regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970. Cryptocurrency markets are rebounding today, with the two highest performers, Bitcoin and Ethereum, posting positive gains following a weekend of largely sideways trading. US lawmakers are debating new crypto rules to solve this regulatory uncertainty that may profoundly reshape the industry. The GENIUS Act is on the verge of a cloture vote in Congress this week, with the CLARITY Act also moving forward. There’s also a bill introduced to turn President Donald Trump’s executive order calling for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve into law. The movement of these legislative actions has generated hope that the cryptocurrency tax reforms proposed by Senator Lummis could soon become law.

2025-06-11T01:15:56,"Asia Morning Briefing: Coinbase Premium, Not Bank of Japan Rates, Might be the Metric to Watch for BTC","Bitcoin BTC is trading at $109.7K as the Wednesday trading day begins in Asia, according to CoinDesk market data. While the world's largest digital asset is trading flat in the early hours of the session, CoinDesk market data shows that it's up 4% on the week. An expected Bank of Japan rate cut isn't doing that much to move the market, even though a low interest rate policy is usually what drives risk-on sentiment and positively impacts BTC prices. One metric to watch instead is the 'Coinbase Premium'. Tracked by CryptoQuant, it measures the price difference between BTC on Coinbase Pro (USD) and Binance (USDT), demonstrating the dollar demand for bitcoin (as opposed to crypto-native demand). ""The Coinbase Premium is gradually rising, indicating that buying pressure from U.S. investors is supporting the trend,"" CryptoQuant analysts wrote in a recent update . ""Additionally, whale buying activity is being observed incrementally."" Part of this movement would include BTC ETF inflow, which has hit $386.27 million so far this week, according to SoSoValue data . That being said, some market observers are concerned that a staked ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), which may be close to getting approved , could put a damper on institutional BTC interest. Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, says that an ETF that gives investors access to ETH yield from staking would be something that BTC ETFs can't match, as they just give exposure to price appreciation. ""This has created a lot of buzz, especially considering how much of bitcoin’s rally was fueled by ETF hype,"" Yang said. ""And let’s be honest: while there’s speculation around Solana or Litecoin ETFs, Ether is still the only other crypto asset with a real existence in U.S. spot ETF. That makes it a go-to option for institutions waiting and watching on the sidelines, ready to move when the timing feels right."" But for now, it's still a waiting game. At least until the BoJ's move is official, as the usual crypto-natives like Arthur Hayes are counting on BTC going parabolic as a result. DEX Volume Has Nearly Doubled in Past Year Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) have always had their eyes on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) since the concept took off in 2018 with the advent of modern Automated Market Maker (AMM) engines – the technology at the center of the product category. But as the year continues, and crypto mergers and acquisitions heat up maybe there'll be a renewed interest in DEXs, considering the massive jump in volume on the platforms in the last year. According to data from Messari, in the last year, trading volume on DEXs has jumped from around 6% of all volume to 12%. In May, that number got closer to 25% as up-and-coming DEX Hyperliquid caught the eye of the market , including crypto's most aggressive traders . But are DEXs and CEX's competitors? No, says OKX President Hong Fang. Speaking with CoinDesk earlier this year in the run-up to Consensus Hong Kong, Fang said that the two are complementary. ""The crypto-native audience will want to be able to use CEX for reliability and DEX for catching innovations,"" she said at the time. ""Such supply-demand dynamics will drive further adoption of DEX to enable innovation while supporting the gradual maturity of the crypto regulatory framework."" News Roundup Trump’s CFTC Nominee Brian Quintenz Says Congress Key to Boosting Crypto Innovation and Consumer Protection Brian Quintenz, President Trump's nominee for chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), emphasized at his Senate confirmation hearing that Congress must lead in establishing clear guidelines to boost crypto innovation and consumer protection simultaneously, CoinDesk previously reported. Quintenz, who previously served as a CFTC commissioner and later as head of policy at venture capital firm a16z, argued that forthcoming market structure legislation could provide clarity needed for entrepreneurs while maintaining safeguards for consumers. During his confirmation, senators expressed concerns about vacancies at the CFTC—particularly the absence of Democratic commissioners—but Quintenz declined to commit to advocating Trump to fill these positions, emphasizing presidential discretion. He acknowledged potential resource needs should the CFTC become the primary regulator for digital commodities, advocating a ""technology-first approach"" to enhance agency efficiency, and defended the role of prediction markets as legitimate tools for hedging and risk management. Aave is Now on Sony's Soneium Aave has launched on Soneium, an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain supported by electronics giant Sony, CoinDesk previously reported. This integration includes exploring real-world applications of Aave's decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin, GHO, across payments, savings, and digital commerce. Aave's involvement will extend to liquidity incentive campaigns, notably partnering with Astar, a significant blockchain player in Japan’s Web3 scene, with a dedicated 100 million ASTR allocation ($4 million) to boost adoption. Soneium already hosts a vibrant 7-million user ecosystem featuring prominent platforms like Uniswap v4, Velodrome, Stargate, and Lido, alongside native protocols Kyo Finance and SuperVol. Stani Kulechov, Aave Labs' founder, emphasized Sony’s global trust and Soneium’s consumer-centric approach as key advantages, aligning with Aave’s strategy of expanding accessibility and mainstream reach.

2025-06-11T01:00:53,"Owning 10,000 XRP? You’re Among Crypto’s Elite, Expert Claims","According to crypto entrepreneur Edoardo Farina, most individual XRP holders could find themselves shut out as inflation and tight budgets squeeze their options. He argues that owning more than 10,000 XRP – which costs about $23,100 at a price of $2.31 per token – has become a barrier for anyone living paycheck to paycheck. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Rich List Data Reveals Concentration Based on reports, there are about 6.55 million XRP wallet addresses in existence. Less than 4% of those wallets contain at least 10,000 XRP. A clear majority, over 5 million addresses, hold 500 XRP or fewer. That gap shows how stacked the system is. More than 166,250 wallets sit in the 10,000–25,000 XRP range. Another 159,566 wallets carry between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP. These figures point to a small group with deep pockets, while the rest trail far behind. Owning more than 10,000 $XRP nowadays is already a luxury few people can afford. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 9, 2025 Inflation Pressures Hit Small Holders Farina warns that rising inflation is forcing ordinary holders to sell just to cover daily needs. He notes, “We’re already seeing people around the world selling their XRP just to buy groceries.” When basic goods cost more each month, people feel they have no choice but to cash out their crypto. It’s a harsh reality. Owning large amounts of XRP has morphed from a luxury into a struggle for survival. Threshold Debate Heats Up He first said 95% of XRP holders risk being priced out. Now he’s raised that warning to 99%. That jump has sparked debate. Some worry it feeds a fear of missing out on a “10,000-XRP club,” while others see it as a wake-up call. Farina questions whether Bitcoin’s rally to about $112,000 really reflects growth, or simply the dollar losing its value. He frames the issue as a tug-of-war between crypto gains and fiat losses. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Calls For New Income Streams Instead of selling crypto, Farina urges holders to find extra income. He suggests side hustles or online work as ways to avoid cutting into holdings. “If you truly believe XRP has long-term value, selling it now for groceries is exactly what they want you to do,” he said. His advice pushes people to rethink how they earn and where they live. Crypto markets can move on legal news and product launches, not only inflation. Ripple’s ongoing court case and ETF filings could change XRP’s path. Still, Farina’s message taps into a broader concern: the gap between small and large holders may widen as prices climb. Retail investors can still join in. They just need to pace their buys and stay aware of both crypto trends and everyday costs.

2025-06-11T01:00:09,"Bitcoin Nearing ATH, But Social Media FOMO Signals Warning","Data shows Bitcoin sentiment on social media may be starting to become overheated, a sign that could end up being a threat to the price rally. Bitcoin Social Media Sentiment Is Currently Notably Positive In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed how sentiment around Bitcoin has changed on the major social media platforms after the latest recovery rally. The indicator of relevance here is the “ Positive/Negative Sentiment ,” which compares the level of positive sentiment to negative sentiment around a given cryptocurrency on social media. The metric works by filtering posts/messages/threads containing mentions of the asset and putting them through a machine-learning model that separates between positive and negative comments. The indicator counts up the number of both types of posts and takes their ratio to provide a net representation of social media. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for Bitcoin over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Positive/Negative Sentiment has seen a spike in the zone above the 1.0 mark, which suggests a flood of positive posts related to the asset have hit social media platforms. This turn toward a significant positive sentiment has come as the cryptocurrency’s price has been going through a recovery surge. This isn’t a particularly unusual trend, as excitement tends to rise among traders whenever bullish price action takes place. In the context of the latest surge, especially, an uplift of sentiment isn’t surprising, as it has brought the price close to the all-time high (ATH) . While some hype is to be expected, an excess of it can be something to watch out for. The reason behind this is the fact that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have historically tended to move in the direction that goes contrary to the crowd’s opinion. This means that a surge of greed in the market is something that can lead to a top for the asset’s price. Similarly, a cooldown in sentiment can imply a bullish reversal instead. From the chart, it’s apparent that the Positive/Negative Sentiment declined to a relatively low level a few days ago when Bitcoin saw a drawdown toward $100,000. This fear among social media users may have helped the coin reach a bottom.

2025-06-11T00:58:49,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: $200K Target in Sight Amid Trump & Japan Tailwinds","A new political player has entered the crypto stage. American Bitcoin (ABTC), backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has quietly accumulated over 215 BTC, valued at $23 million, since its launch on April 1. As revealed in a recent SEC filing dated June 6, ABTC isn’t just a mining company; it’s a Bitcoin accumulation vehicle with long-term ambitions. Operating over 60,000 miners housed in Hut 8 facilities, ABTC generates over 10.17 EH/s of hashpower without owning any real estate. Instead of converting mined Bitcoin into cash, the company stores its reserves securely using Coinbase Custody. Eric and Donald Trump Jr.-backed American #Bitcoin quietly accumulates 215 $BTC ($23M+) since April launch ahead of public merger. pic.twitter.com/OXP9wZvDRS — amit malik (@amitmalikmalik) June 10, 2025 With Eric Trump joining the board and a public listing in the works via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, the company is tying its identity and brand equity to Bitcoin itself. Key points: ABTC’s mining approach focuses on BTC accumulation, not fiat conversion. Trump family’s backing adds political clout and media visibility. Market sees this as bullish supply-side pressure—less BTC on exchanges. U.S. Charges $500M Crypto Laundering Plot While ABTC builds a bullish case, U.S. regulators dropped a bombshell. The DOJ arrested Iurii Gugnin, founder of Evita Pay and Evita Investments, for laundering over $500 million through U.S. banks and crypto platforms, mainly using Tether (USDT).

The indictment includes 22 counts of bank fraud, each carrying up to 30 years in prison. Prosecutors allege he: Bought U.S. technology for banned firms. Falsified documents to hide ties to Russia. Exploited crypto’s opacity to bypass sanctions. This case reinforces growing concerns that digital assets are being used to sidestep international law, prompting stricter global oversight. Still, Bitcoin’s transparent and decentralized nature differentiates it from intermediated platforms and may continue to attract regulatory favor. Japan’s QE Pivot May Ignite Bitcoin Rally Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sees a potential global liquidity wave on the horizon. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) resumes quantitative easing (QE) at its June 16–17 meeting, Hayes believes it could be the next big tailwind for Bitcoin. The Bank of Japan's upcoming policy meeting could impact global risk assets. If they shift to QE, $BTC may surge towards $200K as it becomes a hedge against sovereign risks. Read the full article https://t.co/i2bvc3IJ2I — Nova – {News} AI Agent (@ChainGPTAINews) June 10, 2025 Why? Japan recently signaled plans to reduce bond purchases by ¥400 billion per quarter. But with rising yields, 30-year JGBs hit 3.185% in May—officials may reverse course. Bitcoin previously surged to $112,000 when yields spiked, suggesting investors see it as a hedge against sovereign debt instability. Hayes predicts: QE would boost risk assets, including BTC. Institutions may turn to Bitcoin as a “counterparty-risk-free” asset. A renewed rally could push Bitcoin toward the $200,000 mark in 2025. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: $112K and Beyond? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction is bullish as BTC remains in a bullish ascending channel on the 2-hour chart, trading above the 50-EMA ($107,510) and making consistent higher lows. A bullish engulfing candle on June 9 pushed the price above a key barrier at $108,627, with current resistance at $110,668. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The MACD is flattening, hinting at weakening momentum, while candlesticks show upper wicks—a sign of hesitation. A confirmed breakout above $111,000 could ignite momentum toward $112,000 and $113,500. Technical Levels to Watch: Support: $108,000 (channel base), $107,510 (50-EMA) Resistance: $111,000, $113,500 Trade idea: Buy on breakout or bounce off 50-EMA with a tight stop-loss Conclusion Macro shifts, regulatory crackdowns, and high-profile political support are reshaping the narrative surrounding Bitcoin. As ABTC accumulates, Japan considers more stimulus, and chart patterns remain constructive, the path toward $200K is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a data-backed possibility. BTC Bull Token Nears $8M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,032,776.85 out of its $8,011,104 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002555 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority.

Filing changes signal accelerated Solana ETF approvals A source cited by Blockworks has suggested the filing changes could accelerate the Solana ETF approval, possibly in July or within three to five weeks, before October when most of the final deadlines for a SEC decision expire. According to two sources that spoke with Blockworks, the SEC will provide comments the S-1 forms within a space of 30 days of submission. The agency reportedly solicited for explanations from companies on how investors will get their money back in crypto. It’s also pushing to know if companies plan to include staking, which means earning rewards by helping run the Solana network.

According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the odds of approval in 2025 are at 90%, which matches their forecast for LitecoinETF approval. “We think the SEC may now focus on handling 19b-4 filings for Solana and staking ETFs earlier than planned.” Bloomberg analysts. Seyffart indicated this week that SEC may prioritize reviewing 19b-4 filings for Solana and bet ETFs sooner than expected, adding that the issuers and industry players have likely been working with SEC together with its crypto taskforce to finalize the details. He also added that Solana and XRP already have futures-based ETFs, which usually makes it easier for the SEC to give a not to spot ETFs. Last month the regulator delayed a decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF indicating that it had not “reached any conclusions” on the19b-4 filing to list the proposed ETF. The delay was viewed as procedural rather than rejection. Grayscale wants to convert its SOL Trust into a spot ETF, reflecting the path it used to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF funds. The firm’s filing was delayed on May 13, while Franklin Templeton’s proposal was delayed on April 30, according to SEC. In the meantime, filings by Fidelity and VanEck were postponed on May 19.

2025-06-10T23:57:16,"Saylor defends Strategy’s operating model against Chanos’s trust comparison","Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has fired back at famed short-seller Jim Chanos, rejecting his call to short shares of the Bitcoin-heavy tech firm and buy the cryptocurrency instead. In a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday, Saylor argued that Chanos fundamentally misunderstands Strategy’s business model, calling the arbitrage thesis “misguided.” Chanos, known for shorting companies he deems overvalued, recently suggested investors should bet against bet against Srategy due to its substantial premium over the firm’s Bitcoin-adjusted book value. That premium, which exceeded 200% at one point in 2024, has been a focal point for skeptics who view Strategy as a glorified Bitcoin holding company. But Saylor pushed back. “I don’t think he understands what our business model is,” he said. “We’re actually the largest issuer of Bitcoin-backed credit instruments in the world.” Saylor defends Strategy’s operating model against Chanos’s trust comparison Saylor emphasized that unlike Bitcoin trusts or closed-end funds, Strategy retains the flexibility to actively manage capital by issuing new financial instruments and leveraging its balance sheet. “Trusts can’t leverage Bitcoin. They can’t issue preferred shares, they can’t issue permanent shares at a premium. We can,” Saylor asserted. “What [Chanos] still doesn’t understand is that we are not a holding company or a closed-end trust — we are an operating company.” Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has recently pivoted its capital-raising strategy. Rather than issuing convertible bonds or diluting shareholders through common stock sales, the firm has embraced preferred stock instruments to finance its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. This includes the newly launched STRK (Strike), STRF (Strife), and STRD (Perpetual Stride) preferred shares — a trio of high-yield offerings that collectively raised nearly $1 billion last week. Saylor accuses Chanos of misjudging business model Chanos has not responded to Saylor’s latest remarks. But Saylor was unsparing in his critique of the hedge fund manager’s valuation approach. Saylor said Chanos is valuing the business, generating $8.4 billion of shareholder value at zero, and he is hoping the equity will somehow trade to NAV. He continued to say that Chanos is not paying attention to if Strategy can issue preferred shares that yield 10% and invest that in Bitcoin, which has been going up by 57% for the past four and a half years. Saylor noted that the company is capturing the 47% arbitrage, effectively risk-free for their common stock shareholders. As of Tuesday, Strategy held approximately 582,000 Bitcoin — valued at about $63 billion — making it the largest corporate holder of the asset globally. The company has made over 70 Bitcoin purchase announcements since mid-2020 when Saylor initiated the strategy of using corporate funds to buy the digital currency. Saylor plans stock buybacks to squeeze shorts if premium narrows Saylor also hinted at future financial maneuvers to counter short-seller strategies. Should the premium on Strategy’s stock narrow too much, the firm could issue more preferred shares and use the proceeds to repurchase common shares, further tightening supply and squeezing shorts. “If the stock trades at a weak premium, we’re just going to sell the preferred,” he said. “And if the stock rallies up, he’s going to get liquidated and wiped out.” While the war of words between Chanos and Saylor may intensify, it reflects a broader debate over how to value a Bitcoin-centric operating company in a market still grappling with crypto’s integration into traditional finance. For now, Saylor remains unapologetically bullish — on Bitcoin and Strategy’s ability to outperform critics. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-10T23:30:23,"Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level –  Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance","Ethereum is showing renewed strength after climbing above the $2,600 mark with ease, holding firmly above key support levels as bulls attempt to reclaim momentum. The move comes after weeks of range-bound price action, and while the breakout attempt has gained attention, traders are now watching closely for confirmation through a decisive push above the next resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? So far, ETH has held up well despite broader market volatility. With buyers back in control, the focus has shifted to whether Ethereum can break through the upper boundary of its current range and begin a sustained move higher. Without follow-through, price risks slipping back into consolidation, frustrating bullish positioning. Top analyst Big Cheds recently shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is now pushing into weekly range highs, specifically a zone defined by a cluster of upper shadows and the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA). This region has repeatedly acted as resistance, rejecting previous rally attempts. Ethereum Bulls Eye Breakout Confirmation Ethereum is at a critical juncture as bulls push price toward the $2,800 resistance — a level that must be decisively cleared to confirm a breakout and transition into a full bullish phase. After a sharp rebound from April’s low, where ETH traded near $1,400, the asset has surged more than 90%, reclaiming key moving averages and breaking through previous short-term resistance levels. Momentum is clearly building, but Ethereum now faces its most important test. The $2,800 zone marks the top of the current range and coincides with multiple technical barriers. Cheds highlighted that ETH is now trading into weekly range highs, where a cluster of upper shadows has repeatedly rejected price. This region also aligns with the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA), reinforcing it as a major zone of resistance. According to Cheds, the bear thesis fails if ETH can flip $2,750 into support — a level that would likely signal trend reversal and sustained upside. However, macro risks remain. US Treasury yields continue to climb, reflecting concerns over inflation and tighter financial conditions. Rising yields often put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by pulling liquidity out of speculative markets. Despite these headwinds, Ethereum’s structure remains strong. As long as bulls maintain pressure and defend higher lows, the path toward reclaiming $3,000 becomes more probable. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger increased participation, both from technical traders and investors sidelined by recent volatility. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but the momentum is clearly shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June ETH Reaches Key Resistance Zone After Breakout Ethereum is currently trading at $2,688 on the 4-hour chart, after a strong breakout from a multi-day ascending triangle structure. The move was backed by rising volume and a clean reclaim of all major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($2,558), 100 SMA ($2,571), and 200 SMA ($2,535) — which now act as support beneath price. ETH has pushed directly into a key resistance zone between $2,690 and $2,735, highlighted by several previous rejection wicks. This area has acted as a supply zone since mid-May, capping every breakout attempt and leading to swift pullbacks. The current test marks Ethereum’s fifth attempt to break above this level in recent weeks, which increases the odds of a potential breakout, especially if bulls maintain momentum and volume remains elevated. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? However, if ETH fails to clear this zone, a pullback toward the 200 SMA or the $2,600 level is likely, especially if volume tapers off. The structure remains bullish in the short term, with higher lows forming and buying pressure increasing. A confirmed 4H close above $2,735 would signal breakout confirmation and likely trigger a push toward $2,900–$3,000. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but bulls are clearly pressing on the door.

Per a report from Forbes Russia , the ministry says its proposal is currently undergoing interdepartmental review. However, if the plans are adopted as-is, Russian law agencies and courts will be given the power to seize crypto from illegal miners. Russia: Miners May Be Fined for Flaunting Bans Under the new proposal, Russian judges will also be able to punish individuals engaging in illegal mining. Courts will be able to hand out fines worth between 100,000 to 200,000 rubles ($1,272 to $2,544). Maksut Shadayev, the Russian Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media, speaking at the Federation Council earlier this year. (Source: Federation Council/VK/Screenshot) Forbes Russia says it has seen the ministry’s proposal. It says Moscow also wants to fine and confiscate crypto from any individual found illegally participating in a mining pool. Harsher fines still lie in store for solo entrepreneurs and officials. This group will have to pay between 200,000 and 400,000 rubles ($2,544 to $5088) if convicted. Authorities will also gain the power to take coins from industrial miners who flaunt crypto mining rules. The new rules will let courts impose a fine of 1 million ($12,728) to 2 million rubles ($25,456) on corporations involved in illegal mining. The ministry wants to amend the country’s Code of Administrative Offenses, seeking to effectively make illegal mining a criminal offense.

(Source: Blockchain.com) Crypto Payments Could Also Be Criminalized Under a law that came into force last year, unregistered Russian individuals can mine crypto at home, provided they do not use more than 6,000 kWh per month. However, in some 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions, mining restrictions apply. The law also states that people with unexpunged convictions for economic crimes, or those convicted of extremist or terrorist crimes, cannot mine crypto. The law also bans certain electricity and grid management firms from mining crypto. Additionally, the ministry plans to punish individuals and firms for making settlements in crypto in Russia outside the Central Bank-run crypto sandbox. The ministry’s proposals include plans to fine people and firms who use crypto as a payment tool up to 1 million rubles ($12,728). The Central Bank, however, appears to think that the threat of confiscating coins from people who seek to do business in crypto will be a bigger deterrent. Andrey Medvedev, the bank’s Legal Department lead, told attendees at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum last month: “The key thing is that the [crypto] illegally used as a means of payment will be confiscated.
