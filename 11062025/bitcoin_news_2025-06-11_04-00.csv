2025-06-11T01:44:46,"Senator Lummis refers to the IRS’s crypto tax regulations as 'bad tax regulations'","US Senator Cynthia Lummis has called for changes in the current crypto tax policy. Lummis emphasizes that the policy has been tilted against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Lummis said that the Bitcoin mining community is one of the hardest-hit groups due to the proposed provisions, which would endure potentially duplicative taxes and substantial compliance headaches. This interpretation follows Senator Lummis’ X post that says that America’s crypto tax laws disproportionately target Bitcoin and other digital assets. As a long-time advocate, she argued that the current tax laws are a “complete mess,” with the most problems manifested by Bitcoin. Bitcoin and digital assets are being unfairly targeted because of flawed tax rules. We need crypto revisions in reconciliation. — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 10, 2025 She said the cryptocurrency rules must be updated during the reconciliation process to curb that. Senator Lummis refers to the IRS’s crypto tax regulations as ‘bad tax regulations’ Senator Cynthia Lummis stated that Bitcoin and digital assets are wrongly singled out due to bad tax regulations. Though Lummis does not mention them by name, her remarks likely refer to the IRS’s crypto tax reporting rules, particularly those rolled out in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This law took a wide view of “brokers,” placing miners and developers under the same category. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is also called the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This law widened the broker reporting rules in Sections 6045 and 6045A to cover digital assets. This wide-reaching categorization has faced criticism from miners and developers, who have voiced out their claims. According to them, they would be virtually unable to comply with these regulations. The rules force them to report information like names and transaction amounts in their tax filings — information they often do not even have access to. Lummis’ post called on Congress to try to make the rule change on a special amendment vehicle. The pro-Bitcoin senator calls for “crypto changes in reconciliation” to accelerate the amendment process. According to House rules, some tax or spending bills can be approved with a simple majority using reconciliation. Senator Lummis wants to use this method to change the definition of “broker” and bypass bipartisan gridlock. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970 despite regulatory uncertainties People are also worried that the flawed tax code carries the potential for double taxation in the case of miners and participants in decentralized finance (DeFi). This is because Miners get taxed on their block rewards and then again on capital gains when they sell what they own. At the same time, DeFi users could face several taxable events even if they have not made any profits. However, despite such regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970. Cryptocurrency markets are rebounding today, with the two highest performers, Bitcoin and Ethereum, posting positive gains following a weekend of largely sideways trading. US lawmakers are debating new crypto rules to solve this regulatory uncertainty that may profoundly reshape the industry. The GENIUS Act is on the verge of a cloture vote in Congress this week, with the CLARITY Act also moving forward. There’s also a bill introduced to turn President Donald Trump’s executive order calling for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve into law. The movement of these legislative actions has generated hope that the cryptocurrency tax reforms proposed by Senator Lummis could soon become law.

2025-06-11T01:15:56,"Asia Morning Briefing: Coinbase Premium, Not Bank of Japan Rates, Might be the Metric to Watch for BTC","Bitcoin BTC is trading at $109.7K as the Wednesday trading day begins in Asia, according to CoinDesk market data. While the world's largest digital asset is trading flat in the early hours of the session, CoinDesk market data shows that it's up 4% on the week. An expected Bank of Japan rate cut isn't doing that much to move the market, even though a low interest rate policy is usually what drives risk-on sentiment and positively impacts BTC prices. One metric to watch instead is the 'Coinbase Premium'. Tracked by CryptoQuant, it measures the price difference between BTC on Coinbase Pro (USD) and Binance (USDT), demonstrating the dollar demand for bitcoin (as opposed to crypto-native demand). ""The Coinbase Premium is gradually rising, indicating that buying pressure from U.S. investors is supporting the trend,"" CryptoQuant analysts wrote in a recent update . ""Additionally, whale buying activity is being observed incrementally."" Part of this movement would include BTC ETF inflow, which has hit $386.27 million so far this week, according to SoSoValue data . That being said, some market observers are concerned that a staked ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), which may be close to getting approved , could put a damper on institutional BTC interest. Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, says that an ETF that gives investors access to ETH yield from staking would be something that BTC ETFs can't match, as they just give exposure to price appreciation. ""This has created a lot of buzz, especially considering how much of bitcoin’s rally was fueled by ETF hype,"" Yang said. ""And let’s be honest: while there’s speculation around Solana or Litecoin ETFs, Ether is still the only other crypto asset with a real existence in U.S. spot ETF. That makes it a go-to option for institutions waiting and watching on the sidelines, ready to move when the timing feels right."" But for now, it's still a waiting game. At least until the BoJ's move is official, as the usual crypto-natives like Arthur Hayes are counting on BTC going parabolic as a result. DEX Volume Has Nearly Doubled in Past Year Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) have always had their eyes on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) since the concept took off in 2018 with the advent of modern Automated Market Maker (AMM) engines – the technology at the center of the product category. But as the year continues, and crypto mergers and acquisitions heat up maybe there'll be a renewed interest in DEXs, considering the massive jump in volume on the platforms in the last year. According to data from Messari, in the last year, trading volume on DEXs has jumped from around 6% of all volume to 12%. In May, that number got closer to 25% as up-and-coming DEX Hyperliquid caught the eye of the market , including crypto's most aggressive traders . But are DEXs and CEX's competitors? No, says OKX President Hong Fang. Speaking with CoinDesk earlier this year in the run-up to Consensus Hong Kong, Fang said that the two are complementary. ""The crypto-native audience will want to be able to use CEX for reliability and DEX for catching innovations,"" she said at the time. ""Such supply-demand dynamics will drive further adoption of DEX to enable innovation while supporting the gradual maturity of the crypto regulatory framework."" News Roundup Trump’s CFTC Nominee Brian Quintenz Says Congress Key to Boosting Crypto Innovation and Consumer Protection Brian Quintenz, President Trump's nominee for chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), emphasized at his Senate confirmation hearing that Congress must lead in establishing clear guidelines to boost crypto innovation and consumer protection simultaneously, CoinDesk previously reported. Quintenz, who previously served as a CFTC commissioner and later as head of policy at venture capital firm a16z, argued that forthcoming market structure legislation could provide clarity needed for entrepreneurs while maintaining safeguards for consumers. During his confirmation, senators expressed concerns about vacancies at the CFTC—particularly the absence of Democratic commissioners—but Quintenz declined to commit to advocating Trump to fill these positions, emphasizing presidential discretion. He acknowledged potential resource needs should the CFTC become the primary regulator for digital commodities, advocating a ""technology-first approach"" to enhance agency efficiency, and defended the role of prediction markets as legitimate tools for hedging and risk management. Aave is Now on Sony's Soneium Aave has launched on Soneium, an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain supported by electronics giant Sony, CoinDesk previously reported. This integration includes exploring real-world applications of Aave's decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin, GHO, across payments, savings, and digital commerce. Aave's involvement will extend to liquidity incentive campaigns, notably partnering with Astar, a significant blockchain player in Japan’s Web3 scene, with a dedicated 100 million ASTR allocation ($4 million) to boost adoption. Soneium already hosts a vibrant 7-million user ecosystem featuring prominent platforms like Uniswap v4, Velodrome, Stargate, and Lido, alongside native protocols Kyo Finance and SuperVol. Stani Kulechov, Aave Labs' founder, emphasized Sony’s global trust and Soneium’s consumer-centric approach as key advantages, aligning with Aave’s strategy of expanding accessibility and mainstream reach.

2025-06-11T01:00:53,"Owning 10,000 XRP? You’re Among Crypto’s Elite, Expert Claims","According to crypto entrepreneur Edoardo Farina, most individual XRP holders could find themselves shut out as inflation and tight budgets squeeze their options. He argues that owning more than 10,000 XRP – which costs about $23,100 at a price of $2.31 per token – has become a barrier for anyone living paycheck to paycheck. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Rich List Data Reveals Concentration Based on reports, there are about 6.55 million XRP wallet addresses in existence. Less than 4% of those wallets contain at least 10,000 XRP. A clear majority, over 5 million addresses, hold 500 XRP or fewer. That gap shows how stacked the system is. More than 166,250 wallets sit in the 10,000–25,000 XRP range. Another 159,566 wallets carry between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP. These figures point to a small group with deep pockets, while the rest trail far behind. Owning more than 10,000 $XRP nowadays is already a luxury few people can afford. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 9, 2025 Inflation Pressures Hit Small Holders Farina warns that rising inflation is forcing ordinary holders to sell just to cover daily needs. He notes, “We’re already seeing people around the world selling their XRP just to buy groceries.” When basic goods cost more each month, people feel they have no choice but to cash out their crypto. It’s a harsh reality. Owning large amounts of XRP has morphed from a luxury into a struggle for survival. Threshold Debate Heats Up He first said 95% of XRP holders risk being priced out. Now he’s raised that warning to 99%. That jump has sparked debate. Some worry it feeds a fear of missing out on a “10,000-XRP club,” while others see it as a wake-up call. Farina questions whether Bitcoin’s rally to about $112,000 really reflects growth, or simply the dollar losing its value. He frames the issue as a tug-of-war between crypto gains and fiat losses. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Calls For New Income Streams Instead of selling crypto, Farina urges holders to find extra income. He suggests side hustles or online work as ways to avoid cutting into holdings. “If you truly believe XRP has long-term value, selling it now for groceries is exactly what they want you to do,” he said. His advice pushes people to rethink how they earn and where they live. Crypto markets can move on legal news and product launches, not only inflation. Ripple’s ongoing court case and ETF filings could change XRP’s path. Still, Farina’s message taps into a broader concern: the gap between small and large holders may widen as prices climb. Retail investors can still join in. They just need to pace their buys and stay aware of both crypto trends and everyday costs.

2025-06-11T00:58:49,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: $200K Target in Sight Amid Trump & Japan Tailwinds","A new political player has entered the crypto stage. American Bitcoin (ABTC), backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has quietly accumulated over 215 BTC, valued at $23 million, since its launch on April 1. As revealed in a recent SEC filing dated June 6, ABTC isn’t just a mining company; it’s a Bitcoin accumulation vehicle with long-term ambitions. Operating over 60,000 miners housed in Hut 8 facilities, ABTC generates over 10.17 EH/s of hashpower without owning any real estate. Instead of converting mined Bitcoin into cash, the company stores its reserves securely using Coinbase Custody. Eric and Donald Trump Jr.-backed American #Bitcoin quietly accumulates 215 $BTC ($23M+) since April launch ahead of public merger. pic.twitter.com/OXP9wZvDRS — amit malik (@amitmalikmalik) June 10, 2025 With Eric Trump joining the board and a public listing in the works via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, the company is tying its identity and brand equity to Bitcoin itself. Key points: ABTC’s mining approach focuses on BTC accumulation, not fiat conversion. Trump family’s backing adds political clout and media visibility. Market sees this as bullish supply-side pressure—less BTC on exchanges. U.S. Charges $500M Crypto Laundering Plot While ABTC builds a bullish case, U.S. regulators dropped a bombshell. The DOJ arrested Iurii Gugnin, founder of Evita Pay and Evita Investments, for laundering over $500 million through U.S. banks and crypto platforms, mainly using Tether (USDT).

The indictment includes 22 counts of bank fraud, each carrying up to 30 years in prison. Prosecutors allege he: Bought U.S. technology for banned firms. Falsified documents to hide ties to Russia. Exploited crypto’s opacity to bypass sanctions. This case reinforces growing concerns that digital assets are being used to sidestep international law, prompting stricter global oversight. Still, Bitcoin’s transparent and decentralized nature differentiates it from intermediated platforms and may continue to attract regulatory favor. Japan’s QE Pivot May Ignite Bitcoin Rally Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sees a potential global liquidity wave on the horizon. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) resumes quantitative easing (QE) at its June 16–17 meeting, Hayes believes it could be the next big tailwind for Bitcoin. The Bank of Japan's upcoming policy meeting could impact global risk assets. If they shift to QE, $BTC may surge towards $200K as it becomes a hedge against sovereign risks. Read the full article https://t.co/i2bvc3IJ2I — Nova – {News} AI Agent (@ChainGPTAINews) June 10, 2025 Why? Japan recently signaled plans to reduce bond purchases by ¥400 billion per quarter. But with rising yields, 30-year JGBs hit 3.185% in May—officials may reverse course. Bitcoin previously surged to $112,000 when yields spiked, suggesting investors see it as a hedge against sovereign debt instability. Hayes predicts: QE would boost risk assets, including BTC. Institutions may turn to Bitcoin as a “counterparty-risk-free” asset. A renewed rally could push Bitcoin toward the $200,000 mark in 2025. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: $112K and Beyond? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction is bullish as BTC remains in a bullish ascending channel on the 2-hour chart, trading above the 50-EMA ($107,510) and making consistent higher lows. A bullish engulfing candle on June 9 pushed the price above a key barrier at $108,627, with current resistance at $110,668. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The MACD is flattening, hinting at weakening momentum, while candlesticks show upper wicks—a sign of hesitation. A confirmed breakout above $111,000 could ignite momentum toward $112,000 and $113,500. Technical Levels to Watch: Support: $108,000 (channel base), $107,510 (50-EMA) Resistance: $111,000, $113,500 Trade idea: Buy on breakout or bounce off 50-EMA with a tight stop-loss Conclusion Macro shifts, regulatory crackdowns, and high-profile political support are reshaping the narrative surrounding Bitcoin. As ABTC accumulates, Japan considers more stimulus, and chart patterns remain constructive, the path toward $200K is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a data-backed possibility. BTC Bull Token Nears $8M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,032,776.85 out of its $8,011,104 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002555 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority.

According to two sources that spoke with Blockworks, the SEC will provide comments the S-1 forms within a space of 30 days of submission. The agency reportedly solicited for explanations from companies on how investors will get their money back in crypto. It’s also pushing to know if companies plan to include staking, which means earning rewards by helping run the Solana network.

According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the odds of approval in 2025 are at 90%, which matches their forecast for LitecoinETF approval. “We think the SEC may now focus on handling 19b-4 filings for Solana and staking ETFs earlier than planned.” Bloomberg analysts. Seyffart indicated this week that SEC may prioritize reviewing 19b-4 filings for Solana and bet ETFs sooner than expected, adding that the issuers and industry players have likely been working with SEC together with its crypto taskforce to finalize the details. He also added that Solana and XRP already have futures-based ETFs, which usually makes it easier for the SEC to give a not to spot ETFs. Last month the regulator delayed a decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF indicating that it had not “reached any conclusions” on the19b-4 filing to list the proposed ETF. The delay was viewed as procedural rather than rejection. Grayscale wants to convert its SOL Trust into a spot ETF, reflecting the path it used to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF funds. The firm’s filing was delayed on May 13, while Franklin Templeton’s proposal was delayed on April 30, according to SEC. In the meantime, filings by Fidelity and VanEck were postponed on May 19.

As of Tuesday, June 10, 2025, at 07:08 AM EDT, BTC hovers below its all-time high of $112,000, yet it demonstrates resilience with strong support around the $105,000 level. This positioning suggests the cryptocurrency is well-positioned to maintain its upward trajectory, provided it can sustain this key support. The market’s bullish sentiment is further bolstered by significant accumulation from long-term holders (LTHs), a trend highlighted by recent CryptoQuant data. Starting from the $83,000 level, the LTH cohort has expanded from 14.031 million to 15.182 million BTC, an increase of 1.151 million BTC. Valued at approximately $125.4 billion at current prices, this accumulation reflects a deepening commitment from seasoned investors. This substantial influx of holdings, amassed primarily in the $61K–$83K range, underscores a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s l ong-term value . As the market watches for a potential retest of the $112,000 ATH, the strength of LTH support could be the deciding factor in whether BTC continues its climb or faces a pullback. Bitcoin Prepares To Move As LTH Signal Strength Bitcoin is poised to enter a phase of price discovery, potentially signaling an explosive move that could reshape the entire cryptocurrency market. As of Tuesday, June 10, 2025, BTC is consolidating near its all-time high (ATH) of $112,000, a critical juncture that could dictate its next direction. This week promises to be decisive, with the market teetering between an expansion into uncharted territory above $112,000 or a pullback to clear liquidity below $105,000. Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to fuel volatility across financial markets, with the U.S. economy exhibiting increased systemic risks. Rising US Treasury yields are adding pressure, amplifying the stakes for BTC’s next move. Top analyst Axel Adler recently provided valuable insights , highlighting the robust accumulation by Long-Term Holders (LTHs). Starting from the $83,000 level, the LTH cohort has grown from 14.031 million to 15.182 million BTC, an increase of 1.151 million BTC, currently valued at approximately $125.4 billion. These coins were amassed in the $61K–$83K range, with an average entry price of around $72,000. The LTHs now enjoy an unrealized profit of about $42.5 billion, representing a 51% gain above their cost basis. This significant holding increase reflects strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, potentially acting as a stabilizing force during this consolidation phase. Whether BTC breaks out to new highs or retreats to test lower support, the LTH accumulation suggests a solid foundation. BTC Consolidates Below Price Discovery Bitcoin is trading at $109,546 on the daily chart, consolidating just below the $112,000 all-time high after reclaiming the $109,300 resistance level. The price action shows a strong recovery from last week’s dip to the $103,600 support, a level that continues to act as a key pivot during periods of volatility. This clean bounce from support, followed by multiple higher lows, keeps the overall structure bullish. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $102,409 continues to rise, offering additional support just above the $100K psychological level. Meanwhile, the 100 and 200 SMAs at $93,237 and $95,419 remain well below the current price, highlighting Bitcoin’s dominant trend strength. Volume has been steady, and the price is now pressing against the upper range, suggesting the market is coiling for a decisive move. A daily close above $112K would signal breakout confirmation and likely trigger Bitcoin’s entrance into price discovery. However, if BTC fails to reclaim new highs, a sweep back toward $105K–$106K is possible, especially given current macroeconomic headwinds.

2025-06-10T23:57:16,"Saylor defends Strategy’s operating model against Chanos’s trust comparison","Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has fired back at famed short-seller Jim Chanos, rejecting his call to short shares of the Bitcoin-heavy tech firm and buy the cryptocurrency instead. In a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday, Saylor argued that Chanos fundamentally misunderstands Strategy’s business model, calling the arbitrage thesis “misguided.” Chanos, known for shorting companies he deems overvalued, recently suggested investors should bet against bet against Srategy due to its substantial premium over the firm’s Bitcoin-adjusted book value. That premium, which exceeded 200% at one point in 2024, has been a focal point for skeptics who view Strategy as a glorified Bitcoin holding company. But Saylor pushed back. “I don’t think he understands what our business model is,” he said. “We’re actually the largest issuer of Bitcoin-backed credit instruments in the world.” Saylor defends Strategy’s operating model against Chanos’s trust comparison Saylor emphasized that unlike Bitcoin trusts or closed-end funds, Strategy retains the flexibility to actively manage capital by issuing new financial instruments and leveraging its balance sheet. “Trusts can’t leverage Bitcoin. They can’t issue preferred shares, they can’t issue permanent shares at a premium. We can,” Saylor asserted. “What [Chanos] still doesn’t understand is that we are not a holding company or a closed-end trust — we are an operating company.” Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has recently pivoted its capital-raising strategy. Rather than issuing convertible bonds or diluting shareholders through common stock sales, the firm has embraced preferred stock instruments to finance its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. This includes the newly launched STRK (Strike), STRF (Strife), and STRD (Perpetual Stride) preferred shares — a trio of high-yield offerings that collectively raised nearly $1 billion last week. Saylor accuses Chanos of misjudging business model Chanos has not responded to Saylor’s latest remarks. But Saylor was unsparing in his critique of the hedge fund manager’s valuation approach. Saylor said Chanos is valuing the business, generating $8.4 billion of shareholder value at zero, and he is hoping the equity will somehow trade to NAV. He continued to say that Chanos is not paying attention to if Strategy can issue preferred shares that yield 10% and invest that in Bitcoin, which has been going up by 57% for the past four and a half years. Saylor noted that the company is capturing the 47% arbitrage, effectively risk-free for their common stock shareholders. As of Tuesday, Strategy held approximately 582,000 Bitcoin — valued at about $63 billion — making it the largest corporate holder of the asset globally. The company has made over 70 Bitcoin purchase announcements since mid-2020 when Saylor initiated the strategy of using corporate funds to buy the digital currency. Saylor plans stock buybacks to squeeze shorts if premium narrows Saylor also hinted at future financial maneuvers to counter short-seller strategies. Should the premium on Strategy’s stock narrow too much, the firm could issue more preferred shares and use the proceeds to repurchase common shares, further tightening supply and squeezing shorts. “If the stock trades at a weak premium, we’re just going to sell the preferred,” he said. “And if the stock rallies up, he’s going to get liquidated and wiped out.” While the war of words between Chanos and Saylor may intensify, it reflects a broader debate over how to value a Bitcoin-centric operating company in a market still grappling with crypto’s integration into traditional finance. For now, Saylor remains unapologetically bullish — on Bitcoin and Strategy’s ability to outperform critics. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-10T23:30:23,"Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level –  Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance","Ethereum is showing renewed strength after climbing above the $2,600 mark with ease, holding firmly above key support levels as bulls attempt to reclaim momentum. The move comes after weeks of range-bound price action, and while the breakout attempt has gained attention, traders are now watching closely for confirmation through a decisive push above the next resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? So far, ETH has held up well despite broader market volatility. With buyers back in control, the focus has shifted to whether Ethereum can break through the upper boundary of its current range and begin a sustained move higher. Without follow-through, price risks slipping back into consolidation, frustrating bullish positioning. Top analyst Big Cheds recently shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is now pushing into weekly range highs, specifically a zone defined by a cluster of upper shadows and the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA). This region has repeatedly acted as resistance, rejecting previous rally attempts. Ethereum Bulls Eye Breakout Confirmation Ethereum is at a critical juncture as bulls push price toward the $2,800 resistance — a level that must be decisively cleared to confirm a breakout and transition into a full bullish phase. After a sharp rebound from April’s low, where ETH traded near $1,400, the asset has surged more than 90%, reclaiming key moving averages and breaking through previous short-term resistance levels. Momentum is clearly building, but Ethereum now faces its most important test. The $2,800 zone marks the top of the current range and coincides with multiple technical barriers. Cheds highlighted that ETH is now trading into weekly range highs, where a cluster of upper shadows has repeatedly rejected price. This region also aligns with the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA), reinforcing it as a major zone of resistance. According to Cheds, the bear thesis fails if ETH can flip $2,750 into support — a level that would likely signal trend reversal and sustained upside. However, macro risks remain. US Treasury yields continue to climb, reflecting concerns over inflation and tighter financial conditions. Rising yields often put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by pulling liquidity out of speculative markets. Despite these headwinds, Ethereum’s structure remains strong. As long as bulls maintain pressure and defend higher lows, the path toward reclaiming $3,000 becomes more probable. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger increased participation, both from technical traders and investors sidelined by recent volatility. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but the momentum is clearly shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June ETH Reaches Key Resistance Zone After Breakout Ethereum is currently trading at $2,688 on the 4-hour chart, after a strong breakout from a multi-day ascending triangle structure. The move was backed by rising volume and a clean reclaim of all major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($2,558), 100 SMA ($2,571), and 200 SMA ($2,535) — which now act as support beneath price. ETH has pushed directly into a key resistance zone between $2,690 and $2,735, highlighted by several previous rejection wicks. This area has acted as a supply zone since mid-May, capping every breakout attempt and leading to swift pullbacks. The current test marks Ethereum’s fifth attempt to break above this level in recent weeks, which increases the odds of a potential breakout, especially if bulls maintain momentum and volume remains elevated. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? However, if ETH fails to clear this zone, a pullback toward the 200 SMA or the $2,600 level is likely, especially if volume tapers off. The structure remains bullish in the short term, with higher lows forming and buying pressure increasing. A confirmed 4H close above $2,735 would signal breakout confirmation and likely trigger a push toward $2,900–$3,000. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but bulls are clearly pressing on the door.

2025-06-10T23:30:00,"Russia Set to Fine, Confiscate Coins from Illegal Crypto Miners","Illegal crypto miners operating in Russia could lose their coins and face heavy fines under new rules formulated by the nation’s Ministry of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media. Per a report from Forbes Russia , the ministry says its proposal is currently undergoing interdepartmental review. However, if the plans are adopted as-is, Russian law agencies and courts will be given the power to seize crypto from illegal miners. Russia: Miners May Be Fined for Flaunting Bans Under the new proposal, Russian judges will also be able to punish individuals engaging in illegal mining. Courts will be able to hand out fines worth between 100,000 to 200,000 rubles ($1,272 to $2,544). Maksut Shadayev, the Russian Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media, speaking at the Federation Council earlier this year. (Source: Federation Council/VK/Screenshot) Forbes Russia says it has seen the ministry’s proposal. It says Moscow also wants to fine and confiscate crypto from any individual found illegally participating in a mining pool. Harsher fines still lie in store for solo entrepreneurs and officials. This group will have to pay between 200,000 and 400,000 rubles ($2,544 to $5088) if convicted. Authorities will also gain the power to take coins from industrial miners who flaunt crypto mining rules. The new rules will let courts impose a fine of 1 million ($12,728) to 2 million rubles ($25,456) on corporations involved in illegal mining. The ministry wants to amend the country’s Code of Administrative Offenses, seeking to effectively make illegal mining a criminal offense. BTC hashrate distribution amongst the largest known mining pools over the past four days. (Source: Blockchain.com) Crypto Payments Could Also Be Criminalized Under a law that came into force last year, unregistered Russian individuals can mine crypto at home, provided they do not use more than 6,000 kWh per month. However, in some 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions, mining restrictions apply. The law also states that people with unexpunged convictions for economic crimes, or those convicted of extremist or terrorist crimes, cannot mine crypto. The law also bans certain electricity and grid management firms from mining crypto. Additionally, the ministry plans to punish individuals and firms for making settlements in crypto in Russia outside the Central Bank-run crypto sandbox. The ministry’s proposals include plans to fine people and firms who use crypto as a payment tool up to 1 million rubles ($12,728). The Central Bank, however, appears to think that the threat of confiscating coins from people who seek to do business in crypto will be a bigger deterrent. Andrey Medvedev, the bank’s Legal Department lead, told attendees at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum last month: “The key thing is that the [crypto] illegally used as a means of payment will be confiscated. And this will be the most painful thing.” Russia and China say the Pentagon's proposed missile-defense shield will be destabilizing.

Even as Quintenz awaits the Senate Agriculture Committee's vote on whether to advance his nomination as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Congress is working on market structure legislation that could elevate that agency as the marquee regulator of U.S. crypto activity. Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner, is no stranger to that sector, having served as venture capital firm a16z's head of policy. ""I have always viewed market structure legislation as an opportunity to be both pro-customer protection and pro-innovation at the same time,"" he told the senators weighing his nomination, which ultimately needs to be approved by the overall Senate before he can take over the commission. He said the bill could ""provide the clarity to buildings, entrepreneurs, innovators to develop products"" while also ensuring the regulated firms are appropriately protecting the users of those products. ""Congress should create an appropriate market regulatory regime to ensure that this technology’s full promise can be realized, and I am fully prepared to use my experience and expertise to assist in that effort as well in executing any expanded mission should legislation pass into law,"" Quintenz said, adding that he's willing to work under the CFTC's current powers ""to provide clarity of how the agency’s statutory objectives could be successfully leveraged through this technology."" Quintenz would join a commission that's being abandoned by commissioners . By statute, the CFTC has five members — with three from the party in power — but the members have left or are in the process of leaving, including Acting Chairman Caroline Pham, who said she's leaving when Quintenz starts work. The lone Democrat, Kristen Johnson, said she'll depart ""later this year,"" leaving some uncertainty about her timing. So Quintenz may serve opposite a single Democrat before eventually working alone for a time, leaving potential legal vulnerability for any unilateral policies. Some of the Democratic senators noted the Trump administration has been systematically stripping regulatory commissions of their Democratic members — described by Senator Raphael Warnock as ""political purges"" — and asked Quintenz if he would encourage the White House to fill both sides of the roster. ""The president is the head of the executive, and the president will make his own decisions. Quintenz said. He later added, ""I don't tell the president what to do."" He granted that the agency may need more funding if it's assigned the monumental new task as the regulator of digital commodities spot markets, which would include transactions of bitcoin BTC. Quintenz said that new staff would be made more efficient by ""a technology-first approach"" that makes the employees more efficient. Quintenz also fielded a number of questions on the prediction markets, another area he's had direct experience with as a board member of Kalshi, which fought a legal battle with the CFTC over the regulation of event contracts. He defended such event contracts as an appropriate ""hedging tool."" ""I believe the Commodity Exchange Act is very clear about the purpose of derivatives markets, the purpose of risk management and price discovery, and that events [contracts] can serve a function in that mandate,"" he said.

2025-06-10T22:01:19,"$36,900,000 Crypto Scam Targeting Americans Taken Down by Feds As Five Men Plead Guilty to Running International Criminal Network","The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced that five men have pleaded guilty to a Cambodian-based crypto investment scam that conned victims out of $36.9 million. In a new press release, the DOJ says the international crime ring operated by misleading victims to invest in false digital asset scams. The DOJ says Joseph Wong, Yicheng Zhang, Jose Somarriba, Shengsheng He and Jingliang Su were part of an international criminal network that tricked American victims into believing they were investing in digital assets, but instead funneled money through US shell companies, international bank accounts and crypto wallets. Through texts, phone calls, social media and dating apps, the perpetrators contacted victims and gained their trust. They would then convince victims to invest in fraudulent crypto projects, telling the victims all the while that their investments were increasing in value.

2025-06-10T22:00:38,"Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises","As Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) rises in the crypto market, analysts are closely watching for signs of the long-awaited altcoin season. In a recent analysis, a crypto market expert shared key insights on the best time to buy altcoins, offering strategic guidance for traders looking to position themselves ahead of the next potential market rally. When To Position For The Altcoin Season As the Bitcoin price continues its upward trajectory, the speculation about an impending altcoin season remains a recurring theme across crypto communities. However, a Bitcoin Dominance chart shared by ‘Stockmoney Lizards,’ a pseudonymous crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), challenges the narrative that an altcoin season is imminent. Related Reading: The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62% Drawing on personal experience and market cycles, Stockmoney Lizards explains that the repeated cries of “altcoin season is here” are often premature and misleading. The analyst revealed that the true altcoin season, the period where even the lowest-quality coins tend to skyrocket, is often the final phase of the crypto bull run. It begins when Bitcoin Dominance breaks below the 60% support level, signaling a market-wide shift into altcoins. Notably, the analyst has shed light on how and when to position ahead of the altcoin season. Instead of buying altcoins based on hype or assumptions of immediate gains, Stockmoney Lizards suggests a more disciplined strategy: accumulate only at extreme oversold levels. This is typically when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour or daily time frame drops below 25-30, reflecting capitulation. According to the market expert, these moments offer the best entry points for short-term rebounds, where altcoins deliver explosive moves of about 50% to 200%. The analyst further highlights that the primary objective is to take profits and rotate them back into Bitcoin. This approach not only maximizes gains but also minimizes exposure to prolonged drawdowns that usually follow the euphoric phase of the market cycle. Bitcoin Dominance Influence On AltSeason According to Stockmoney Lizards, the current behaviour of BTC.D, trading firmly between a well-defined channel, indicates that the market is still in the early to mid-phase of a bull run. Typically, this phase is dominated by Bitcoin, not altcoins, and history shows that institutional capital prefers to build positions in the flagship cryptocurrency before moving to riskier lower-cap assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $200,000 And Ethereum At $10,000? Analyst Says Altcoin Season Is Coming Notably, Bitcoin’s rising dominance in the market is not seen by the analyst as a bearish signal for altcoins in the long term. Instead, it is perceived as a healthy sign of a maturing bull market. He disclosed that the real altcoin season doesn’t begin until BTC.D decisively breaks down from its channel and drops to historical lows. Until then, Bitcoin’s strength reflects institutional accumulation and market confidence. Stockmoney Lizards reveals that retail investors often misinterpret this as a signal to chase altcoins, only to be caught holding bags as BTC continues to outperform. The analyst concludes that the altcoin season breakout will eventually come, but only those who position smartly by letting Bitcoin lead and waiting for alts to reach oversold extremes will be best prepared to capitalize on the market rally.

2025-06-10T21:55:36,"Bitcoin Price Bounces To $110,000, But Is This Just A Bull Trap In Disguise? Here’s What Analysts Say","The Bitcoin price has bounced back to $110,000, with experts warning this could be a bull trap. The Bitcoin price experienced downward pressure earlier in the week, but it subsequently retraced, with many suggesting it could be a bull trap in disguise. While the Bitcoin price movement lures investors into a bull trap, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining traction with its presale hitting new heights. Bitcoin Price Hits $110,000: Investors Wonder If It’s A Bull Trap The Bitcoin price surged past the $110,000 mark this week, continuing its upward momentum, but not without raising concerns of a bull trap among analysts. While many are calling this a bull trap, one analyst has shared that this move could push the Bitcoin price to new heights. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade shared an analysis that this move indicated the Bitcoin price has completed a classic breakout pattern. After the brief dip, the Bitcoin price retraced slightly, landing just above the key Fibonacci 0.618 support level, signaling strong bullish momentum. However, skepticism lingers over whether the upward move has staying power or if it could evolve into a classic bull trap. Momentum Builds For FloppyPepe (FPPE) As AI-Driven Presale Reaches Fresh Highs FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents a unique opportunity with an early advantage that’s hard to overlook. The project is currently undergoing beta testing, and a carefully planned rollout featuring a zero-tax presale is in progress, offering tokens at a price of just $0.00000035 . This opens up significant growth possibilities for investors, as the project aims to thrive by being listed on prominent centralized exchanges. It uses influencer marketing across platforms such as X, Instagram, and TikTok to garner viral attention. Merging AI Functionality With Community Participation FloppyPepe (FPPE) is creating a smart, AI-driven ecosystem with practical applications. Its roadmap includes various advanced tools, such as FloppyAI , an upcoming chatbot offering guidance in academics and careers. Additionally, there’s FloppyX , a system for user-generated video content that uses dynamic content generation, and a Meme-o-matic AI agent for creating memes. This AI-focused approach is designed for a tech-savvy audience seeking both entertainment and practicality, setting FloppyPepe (FPPE) apart from other meme coins. Moreover, SolidProof has conducted a successful audit of the project’s smart contract. Floppynomics: Encouraging Participation While Supporting Real-World Causes FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) transaction structure incorporates a 3% fee on all trades, designed to benefit both the ecosystem and the global community. A portion of this fee goes towards wildlife conservation, another segment is redistributed as rewards to holders, all within a massive supply of 120 trillion tokens. The initiative will sponsor efforts to conserve endangered species, such as hippos, and aid in habitat restoration. Furthermore, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) project aims to collaborate with local organizations to make sure that its contributions have the most significant impact in key areas. Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Might Be The Only 1000x Meme Coin Left To Buy In 2025 Given the presale price of $0.00000035 , the potential upside associated with FloppyPepe (FPPE) is vast, especially compared to the slow growth of many other meme tokens. Only 20% of the total tokens are available in the presale, while 60% of the circulating supply is earmarked for early distribution. If the post-listing expectations are realized and the token reaches $0.01, this could theoretically result in a return of up to one thousand percent, turning a $50 investment into $50,000. This offers a significantly larger profit potential than most altcoins can provide. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Don’t Miss This Investment Window While investors’ fears of a bull trap grow, FloppyPepe (FPPE), on the other hand, is gaining incredible momentum in its presale stage. Analysts suggest that tokens in early phases with unique utility and a token’s low market cap are often seen as a strong signal for possible triple-digit returns. Remarkably, the first stage of FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale sold out within weeks, raising over $2 million. The presale price, fixed at just $0.00000035, presents a final opportunity to invest at such a low entry point. Seize this potentially life-changing chance now.

2025-06-10T21:45:00,"Is This the Perfect Time for Altcoins? Expert Predictions on the Next Crypto Move","Altcoins set for growth as BTC nears all-time highs, signaling volatility and rally potential. Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink are leading altcoins poised for significant growth. Meme coins like Pepe and Dogecoin are attracting retail interest but require cautious trading. The cryptocurrency markets are now at a major stage, with altcoins preparing for significant growth. As Bitcoin (BTC) nears its all-time high, altcoins are expected to experience increased volatility, with smaller pullbacks and larger upward movements. This movement follows the departure of many investors from their positions, potentially setting the stage for a strong altcoin rally. In a YouTube video on Tuesday, Crypto Banter announced that the overall market condition is transforming. The analyst anticipates that once the short squeeze ends, altcoins will likely experience a rise.

2025-06-10T21:00:19,"Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level – No Clear Breakout Yet","Ethereum is making waves in the crypto market, pushing into key resistance levels following an impressive 14% surge over the past few days. This upward momentum has put bulls firmly in control, igniting optimism among investors as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap tests critical thresholds. The recent rally has brought Ethereum close to a pivotal juncture, where breaking through higher levels could confirm sustained bullish momentum and potentially signal the start of a broader uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? Top analyst Daan recently shared an insightful analysis, highlighting that Ethereum remains rangebound between approximately $2,475 and $2,735. This consolidation zone has proven to be a battleground, with the price repeatedly testing its boundaries. Notably, Ethereum has now retested the range high of $2,735 for the fourth time, a level that has acted as both support and resistance in recent weeks. The price has also swept both the highs and lows within this range, suggesting a period of indecision that could precede a significant move. For bulls to maintain their dominance, clearing this resistance will be crucial. Failure to do so might invite renewed selling pressure, keeping the market on edge as traders watch for the next catalyst. Ethereum Clears Range Highs But Needs Confirmation Ethereum stands at a decisive level following a robust push into resistance, marking a critical moment for the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. After a notable surge, the price has tested key thresholds, drawing sharp attention from market participants. Sentiment remains deeply divided, with some analysts anticipating a breakout to higher prices, fueled by the recent momentum, while others predict an imminent correction as overextension risks loom. This uncertainty is compounded by global tensions and macroeconomic instability, which continue to drive volatility across financial markets, keeping traders on edge. Daan’s recent analysis provides a detailed perspective, noting that Ethereum remains rangebound between approximately $2,475 and $2,735. Within this zone, the price has swept both the highs and lows, reflecting a period of consolidation. Significantly, Ethereum has now retested the range high of $2,735 for the fourth time, a level that has repeatedly served as a psychological and technical barrier. According to Daan, this prolonged range play suggests that a breakout—either upward or downward—is on the horizon, likely triggering a substantial move. However, he cautions that until such a breakout occurs, it’s prudent to avoid overcommitting to either bullish or bearish positions. The analyst points out that over the past few weeks, traders have repeatedly bet on breakouts in both directions, only to face choppy conditions that often result in losses. This pattern of indecision has left many investors “chopped up,” as premature bets fail to materialize. With global economic uncertainties adding pressure, Ethereum’s next move hinges on whether bulls can decisively clear the $2,735 resistance or if bears will capitalize on a potential reversal. Until clarity emerges, the market remains a battleground of competing forces. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June Price Action Details: Key Levels To Clear Ethereum is trading at $2,690.46 on the 1-day chart, following a period of consolidation after a sharp decline. After finding support near $1,750 in April, ETH formed a tentative ascending triangle pattern, with recent price action testing key moving averages. The 50-day SMA ($2,310.51) and 100-day SMA ($2,077.91) have been breached upward, while the 200-day SMA ($2,657.01) remains a critical resistance, aligning with the current price zone. This move suggests short-term resilience, setting the stage for a potential test of the $2,750 resistance, a level retested four times since early 2025. A decisive daily close above $2,750, supported by rising volume, could pave the way for a push toward $3,000. The chart reveals rising lows since April, indicating accumulation and renewed buyer interest, particularly around the $2,500-$2,600 range. Increasing volume during recent upticks adds credibility to the breakout attempt, reducing the likelihood of a false move. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? If ETH holds above $2,500, the trend leans bullish. However, a rejection at $2,750 might drive the price back to the $2,250-$2,400 support zone. The market remains rangebound between $2,475 and $2,735, per analyst Daan’s insights, with a breakout likely to trigger a significant move. All eyes are on whether ETH can clear $2,750 to confirm upward momentum.

2025-06-10T21:00:00,"Michael Saylor Urges Apple to Invest in Bitcoin","Michael Saylor urged Apple to buy Bitcoin, reigniting debate over corporate crypto strategy during a public exchange with Jim Cramer. Saylor’s company Strategy now holds nearly 570,000 BTC worth almost $60B, a journey highlighted in a recent Financial Times documentary. Apple is gradually opening up to crypto, now allowing external crypto payment links in iOS apps and supporting stablecoin payments via Apple Pay and Mesh.

2025-06-10T20:59:16,"Bitcoin Rises to $110K as Altcoins Rally; Traders Skeptical of Breakout","Bitcoin recaptured the $110,000 level for the second consecutive day, perhaps dragged higher by even larger gains among altcoins. Up 0.9% more than 1% in the last 24 hours, bitcoin was trading just above $110,000 shortly after the close of U.S. stock markets Tuesday. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, exchange coins and memecoins — has risen 3.3% in the same period of time, mostly thanks to ether ETH, solana SOL, chainlink LINK all gaining 5%-7%. The standout performances, however, were put on by uniswap UNI and aave AAVE, which soared a whooping 24% and 13%, respectively. The move was prompted by optimistic comments on the topic of DeFi by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins on Monday. Things have remained relatively calm on the equities front, with most crypto stocks flat on the day. A notable exception is Semler Scientific (SMLR), a firm that aims to follow Strategy’s (MSTR) playbook and vacuum up as much bitcoin as possible. Shares fell another 10% today, with the stock now trading for less than the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet . Despite the day’s gains, positioning across crypto markets still reflects a largely defensive tone. ""Funding rates and other leverage proxies point toward a steadily cautious sentiment in the market,” Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, pointed out in a Tuesday report. ""The broad risk appetite is remarkably weak, given that BTC is trading close to former all-time highs."" Binance’s BTC perpetual swaps posted negative funding rates on multiple days last week, with the average annualized funding rate now sitting at just 1.3% — a level typically associated with local market bottoms rather than tops, Lunde noted. ""Bitcoin does not usually peak in environments with negative funding rates,"" he wrote, adding that past instances of such positioning have more often preceded rallies than corrections. Flows into leveraged bitcoin ETFs paint a similar picture. The ProShares 2x Bitcoin ETF (BITX) currently holds exposure equivalent to 52,435 BTC — well below its December 2023 peak of 76,755 BTC — and inflows remain muted. This defensive positioning, according to Lunde, leaves room for a potential ""healthy rally"" in BTC to develop. Still, not all market watchers are convinced that the current price action marks the start of a sustainable breakout. ""Is this a true breakout that will continue? In my view, probably not,"" said Kirill Kretov, senior automation expert at CoinPanel. ""More likely, it’s part of the same volatility cycle where we see a rally now, followed by a sharp drop triggered by a negative announcement or some other narrative shift."" According to Kretov, the current environment favors experienced traders who can navigate volatility-driven market structure. Technically, he sees BTC's next key support levels at $105,000 and $100,000 — zones that could be tested if selling pressure returns.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/10/bitcoin-rises-to-110k-as-altcoins-rally-traders-skeptical-of-breakout,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|UNI","Markets|Bitcoin|Uniswap|Aave|Semler scientific|Market Wrap|News",cryptocompare
