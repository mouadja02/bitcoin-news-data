2025-06-11T11:45:18,"GameStop Shares Dip After-Hours Despite Bitcoin Investment","GameStop Corp (GME) shares slipped over 3.5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday following the release of its first-quarter earnings report, which showed mixed results. While the company posted improved profitability and narrowed operational losses, its revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations, highlighting ongoing challenges in the retail gaming sector. For the quarter ending May 3, GameStop reported revenue of $732.4 million, missing analysts’ forecast of $754.2 million and marking a 17% year-over-year decline from $881.8 million. The company’s financial update attributed the shortfall to weakening demand for physical video games—an industry trend that has been chipping away at GameStop’s core business for years. However, the company reported a net income of $44.8 million, a sharp turnaround from a net loss of $32.3 million in the same period last year. Operating losses also improved significantly, shrinking to $10.8 million from $50.6 million in Q1 2024. Bitcoin Enters the Balance Sheet The earnings report was also GameStop’s first since it revealed its entry into the world of Bitcoin. On May 28, the company disclosed that it had purchased 4,710 BTC—worth around $513 million at the time—making it one of the latest public firms to add Bitcoin to its treasury reserves. The Bitcoin purchase was financed through a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering , indicating GameStop’s commitment to diversifying its financial strategy beyond traditional investments. While the company has not announced a specific target for future Bitcoin holdings, it has stated it may increase or liquidate its holdings depending on market conditions. GameStop’s cash position stands strong, with $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities—up significantly from just $1 billion a year ago. This financial cushion gives the company room to explore further Bitcoin acquisitions if it chooses to pursue that route. GameStop Stock Performance Still Under Pressure Despite its improved bottom line and foray into digital assets, GameStop’s stock has remained relatively stagnant. GME is down approximately 3.8% year-to-date and continues to trade well below its historic January 2021 high of over $80, which occurred during the Reddit-fueled WallStreetBets surge. With a solid cash reserve and a bold step into Bitcoin , GameStop appears to be betting on a broader transformation. But whether this shift will be enough to revitalize investor confidence in a declining retail gaming market remains to be seen.

2025-06-11T11:25:42,"Will Bitcoin Hit $1 Million or Crash to Zero as Saylor Predicts?","MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has claimed that Bitcoin will reach the $1 million mark, dismissing fears that a new crypto winter may be coming. Saylor insists that “all evidence” points to incredible growth for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. “Winter is not coming back again,” Saylor stated during an interview with Bloomberg on June 10. “We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin doesn’t drop to zero, it will reach $1 million.” Billion-dollar asset manager ARK Invest in April raised its bullish Bitcoin price forecast from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. According to Saylor, approximately 450 Bitcoin are available for sale every day from miners, which equates to about $50 million at the current price. “If that $50 million is being absorbed, the price should go up,” he explained. He added that a growing number of public companies buying Bitcoin are acquiring “the entirety of the current supply.” MicroStrategy has accumulated 582,000 Bitcoin since it began buying in 2020, which is roughly $63.85 billion according to data from Saylor Tracker. “At current price levels, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the cryptocurrency economy one turn,” he said. However, Saylor acknowledged that if Bitcoin rises to $500,000 or $1 million, a correction of roughly $200,000 should be expected. Saylor pointed to ample evidence in the economy supporting his all-or-nothing prediction. He emphasized the support for Bitcoin from U.S. President Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. Traditional banks are also gearing up to provide Bitcoin storage services. “Bitcoin has passed its riskiest period; the accounting is fixed,” Saylor said. While Trump publicly supports Bitcoin, his trade war in February was a key catalyst for Bitcoin’s 40% fall from its January high of $109,000. Saylor also noted that BlackRock and other Bitcoin ETF providers are buying up the leading cryptocurrency on a daily basis. In addition, nation-states are also “joining the market.” This vision of Bitcoin’s binary future — either zero or a million — has played out in dramatic ways for early adopters. The story of Laszlo Hanyecz, the programmer who made the world’s first real-world Bitcoin transaction, is a legendary example. In May 2010, Hanyecz famously spent 10,000 Bitcoin to buy two pizzas — an amount worth just $41 at the time, but now valued at over $700 million at Bitcoin’s all-time high. Hanyecz, who also pioneered GPU mining and contributed to Bitcoin’s early software, is estimated to have spent or given away up to 80,000 Bitcoin in 2010 alone. If he had held onto those coins, his net worth could have exceeded $8 billion today. Yet, Hanyecz has said he has no regrets. For him, the value was in proving Bitcoin’s real-world utility and helping the network grow. His story serves as a reminder that Bitcoin’s journey has always been about bold bets and long-term conviction—qualities that Saylor now champions on a corporate scale. Saylor’s all-or-nothing outlook, combined with the lessons of pioneers like Hanyecz, underscores why so many in the crypto community see Bitcoin’s future as a high-stakes game: the rewards for conviction can be life-changing, but the risks are ever-present.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9527/will-bitcoin-hit-1-million-or-crash-to-zero-as-saylor-predicts,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-11T11:20:19,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Ether Outshines Bitcoin Ahead of CPI; Traders Eye ‘Altcoin ETF Summer’","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) briefly rose past $110,000 after headlines out of London pointed to progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations. It's now dropped back to remain little changed over 24 hours while the CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index rose 2%, suggesting a rotation into altcoins. One factor keeping bitcoin at bay and the preference for altcoins might be that the agreement out of London remains tentative, still needing sign-off from both Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. In traditional markets, the reaction was also mixed. Asian equities rose, with the Hang Seng index adding 0.8%, European stock indexes gained less than 0.2% and U.S. index futures pointed down. “There’ve been several twists and turns already, and markets are getting fairly used to this uncertainty by now,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said . Meantime, investors are preparing for a fresh batch of inflation data. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report due later today is expected to show a 0.3% increase in core inflation for May, with annual core inflation rising to 2.9%. Producer price data, which will follow tomorrow, is also forecast to climb. Among altcoins, ether (ETH) is showing quieter but potentially more meaningful strength. Options markets suggest traders are positioning for upside, with front-end volatility spiking and call options gaining favor, according to analysts at hedge fund QCP Capital . Add to that the $450 million in ether ETF inflows logged so far this month, and there's a suggestion of growing investor appetite. The shift is underpinned by the Ethereum blockchain’s expanding role as infrastructure for tokenized real-world assets. “Looking ahead, macro tailwinds are aligning for ETH,"" the QCP Capital analysts wrote. ""With the GENIUS Act advancing in the U.S. Senate, Circle’s IPO discussions resurfacing, and stablecoins gaining regulatory traction, Ethereum’s native role in tokenization and settlement rails may be primed for outsized structural upside.” Nevertheless, the CPI report is likely to dominate the conversation. A hotter-than-expected reading could reinforce concerns that inflation may remain sticky into the coming months, reducing the chance of a Fed interest-rate cut and potentially prompting a renewed run for hedges like gold. If the data comes in cooler, it could open the door for risk assets, including crypto, to extend their gains. Stay alert!

The maximum reading is 100. ETH trading also dominated derivatives markets: Coinglass data shows that more than $111 billion worth of ETH contracts changed hands over the past 24 hours, while BTC's contract trading volume just topping $87.5 billion. Ether also experienced $131 million worth of liquidations, more than double bitcoin's total. ETH is currently trading at $2,760, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours while bitcoin is little changed. Derivatives Positioning BTC options open interest (OI) hit $36.0B on Deribit, another June high. The $140K strike remains the most active, with $1.8B notional, and the 27 June expiry continues to hold the bulk of positioning at $13.9B. Calls make up 63% of OI, with the put/call ratio at 0.58 according to Deribit. ETH options OI rose to $6.6B, with the $3K strike holding $521M notional. The 27 June expiry leads with $2.4B, and calls account for 70% of open interest. The put/call ratio sits at 0.43 based on Deribit data, a more bullish skew than BTC. Futures OI across Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit and Hyperliquid climbed to $57.5B, marking the highest level since late January, according to Velo data. Binance leads with $24.3B. Funding rate APR remains broadly positive, with BTC at 9.8% on Binance and ETH at 10.95% on average across major exchanges. Actual 24-hour liquidations totaled $310.7M, led by $125.7M in ETH (split $48.1M long, $77.6M short) and $55.4M in BTC (evenly split between $27.5M longs and $27.9M shorts), according to Coinglass.

The price is still trading in the daily orderblock of supply, which has capped the price since May. A healthy pullback could see price revisit the daily fair value gap around $2,650 — an area that bulls will likely eye for a potential higher low, especially with the U.S. CPI data on deck later today.

2025-06-11T11:20:15,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – June 11, 2025","The crypto market has seen another rise today, with nearly all top 100 coins recording a price increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 1% to $3.58 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $138 billion, the highest we’ve seen in several days. TLDR: The market records another increase, sentiment turns bullish; BTC is moving towards testing a new all-time high; ETH is among the day’s best performers, may see additional gains; Crypto and TradFi are focused on the US-China trade agreement and the US inflation report; US spot BTC ETFs record $431 million in inflows, spot ETH ETFs continue 17 days of inflows; Sygnum warns that Strategy’s holdings are “approaching a point where they become problematic”; The rally seems sustainable, but the investors stay focused on the heated macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Crypto Winners & Losers Like yesterday, all top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices increase over the past 24 hours. The world’s top coin, Bitcoin (BTC) has risen by just 0.3%, meaning it’s unchanged in this timeframe, now trading at $109,531. This is also the smallest increase in this category. Ethereum (ETH) has recorded another notable rise. It’s up 4.6% to the price of $2,798. The category’s highest gainer is Dogecoin (DOGE) , which is now up 5.4%, changing hands at $0.2013. Moreover, looking at the top 100 coins, we find that only seven are down. Bittensor (TAO) fell the most among these: 3.1% to $421. Uniswap (UNI) noted the highest increase today, as it appreciated 18.1% to $8.41. Six other coins recorded double-digit increases. Investors, both crypto and TradFi, were focused on the US-China discussions in London for the past two days, where participants addressed tariffs and restrictions on shipments of key products, such as rare earth minerals and chips. On Tuesday, the parties said they agreed on “a framework” on both issues, though the specifics remain unclear. Moreover, Wednesday morning in the US will see the consumer price index for May, which will indicate how tariffs are affecting inflation. BREAKING: Citing trade wars, the World Bank sharply downgrades the global economic growth forecast for this year. https://t.co/PNmaVrcAMf — The Associated Press (@AP) June 10, 2025 Meanwhile, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at the onchain options AI-powered platform, Derive.xyz , argued that prices surged after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced exemptions for DeFi projects. ETH is “the big winner as it paves the way for rapid expansion.” Sebastian Pfieffer, managing director of Impossible Cloud Network , noted that Ethereum works to comply with European laws, but that “now it’s Europe’s turn to embrace decentralization, rather than putting unnecessary roadblocks in place.” This way, “Europe can be free of US political control over its cloud infrastructure,” he says. All Eyes on US Inflation Report Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler , said that there is a strong possibility for BTC to hit a new ATH soon. The price currently stands just a few percentage points below its previous peak. “Broadly speaking, financial markets remain optimistic,” he says. “However, the risk of a reversal remains, particularly if upcoming economic data disappoints. All eyes are now on [today’s] US inflation report. While markets are pricing in a moderate uptick, a higher-than-expected reading could trigger increased volatility across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.” Derive.xyz’s Sean Dawson commented that, despite the recent uptick in price, BTC implied volatility still hovers around its lowest levels this year. He explains that this could indicate “significant mispricing, offering traders opportunities to access cheap upside leverage or downside protection.” BTC 7-day (red) and 30-day (cyan) implied volatility. Source: Derive.xyz Dawson says that the muted response of implied BTC volatility despite the price rise suggests “a potential disconnect between market pricing and underlying risk. This presents a strategic window for traders to capitalize on relatively low-cost options, enabling efficient positioning for either further upside or potential downside in BTC.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $109,531, still nearing the all-time high of $111,814, which it hit on 22 May. The coin tested the $110,200 yet again today, reaching the intraday high of $110,237, but failed to maintain it. That said, should it break the ATH again, it will proceed to test the key resistance levels of $115,103 and $118,358. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView In the same period, Ethereum hit an intraday high of $2,821, seeing a minor pullback since, but gradually climbing on a daily basis. The coin broke the resistance level of $2,720, suggesting additional increases to follow. Sean Dawson commented that ETH volatility has jumped nearly 5% to 70% for 7-day volatility. It’s also holding at 66% for 30-day volatility. This means that daily ETH price moves “could be approximately twice as large as BTC’s,” he argued.

Crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 65 today , indicating increasingly bullish sentiment and investors continuing to buy in. Meanwhile, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net inflow of $431.12 million on Tuesday. BlackRock’s $336.74 million contributed the most to this amount. The total net inflow so far stands at $45.06 billion. At the same time, US ETH spot ETFs have recorded seventeen consecutive days of inflows, adding another $124.93 million. BlackRock leads this list again with $80.59 million on 10 June. Overall, Ethereum investment products have seen a cumulative total net inflow of $3.5 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is continually seeing a rising investor interest, with over 80 publicly traded companies now holding BTC. However, some have raised red flags. According to the latest report by the global digital asset bank Sygnum , “large concentrated holdings are a risk for any asset.” At this point, Strategy’s holdings are “approaching a point where they become problematic, with the company holding close 3% of the total Bitcoin ever issued, but a much higher share of the actual liquid supply.” The company aims to acquire 5% of the total issued BTC. This “raises concerns.” Firstly, these vehicles amassing too much of the supply undermine Bitcoin’s safe haven properties. Secondly, private corporations controlling a large portion of the existing supply would make BTC inappropriate for central banks to hold as a reserve asset, Sygnum warns. Finally, a plunge in the liquid supply will also deter large institutions. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? Both the crypto and stock markets have increased in the last day, though crypto’s increase is notably higher. For example, the S&P 500 has increased by 0.55%, the Nasdaq-100 is up 0.66%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.25%. Stocks are up for three days straight, and today, they’re expected to react to the agreement reached during the US-China trade talks. Is this rally sustainable? The positive market sentiment keeps powering the current two-day rally. Analysts see the market moving higher, but they do warn traders and investors to keep an eye on macroeconomic and geopolitical events.

2025-06-11T11:17:54,"Connecticut Passes Bill to Ban Bitcoin and Crypto Investments","The post Connecticut Passes Bill to Ban Bitcoin and Crypto Investments appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On Tuesday, the state of Connecticut passed a controversial bill banning Bitcoin, making it illegal for citizens to hold or invest in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The bill, officially titled HB7082: “An Act Concerning the Regulation of Virtual Currency and State Investments ,” marks a major shift in crypto policy. Key Highlights of the Connecticut Crypto Ban 1. Crypto Risk Disclosure Required Under HB7082, crypto businesses engaged in money transmission must disclose all associated risks to consumers. This provision aims to protect investors from potential losses in the volatile crypto market. 2. Parental Consent for Minors Apps handling cryptocurrencies must now verify parental approval for users under the age of 18, adding a layer of safety for younger users. 3. Protecting Public Funds The bill ensures that state-level crypto activity is closely regulated to protect government funds from being exposed to crypto market risks. Stricter Regulations on Crypto Businesses The bill enforces strict anti-money laundering (AML) policies. All crypto-related businesses must comply with regulations designed to prevent illicit financial activity, a move that Connecticut lawmakers say will make the digital asset space safer and more transparent. Falling Behind in the Bitcoin Reserve Race? While Connecticut is cracking down, other US states are racing to build Bitcoin reserves: New Hampshire Texas Arizona These states are exploring strategic Bitcoin reserves (SBRs) in line with Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, said: “Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value aligns with our state’s history of making smart, diversified investments in emerging assets.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Queen Senator Lummis Says Unfair Tax Laws Threaten Bitcoin , More US States Abandon Crypto Laws Connecticut isn’t alone in backing away from crypto. A growing number of US states have recently dropped or paused crypto-related legislation, including: Florida Wyoming South Dakota North Dakota Pennsylvania Montana Oklahoma The reason? Bitcoin’s price volatility and doubts over long-term stability. GENIUS Act and Stablecoin Regulation Ahead Despite state-level setbacks, the U.S. is preparing for federal-level crypto reform. The upcoming GENIUS Act and stablecoin legislation are set to be discussed by U.S. Senators on Wednesday, June 12. These efforts, led by Trump-aligned lawmakers, aim to create a unified national approach to stablecoins and digital asset oversight. Final Thoughts As Connecticut bans Bitcoin, the crypto landscape across the U.S. continues to shift. With federal laws like the GENIUS Act and states like Texas building reserves, the divide between crypto-friendly and crypto-cautious regions is growing. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-11T11:10:14,"Here’s Why the Bitcoin Network Feels Like a Ghost Town Despite the $110K Recovery","Bitcoin climbed $110,000 on June 11, in a significant milestone that has reignited bullish sentiment across the crypto market. The latest surge has prompted market participants to predict that the leading cryptocurrency could be on track for a push toward new all-time highs in the coming weeks. However, the data tells a different story. On-Chain Apathy and Record-Low Spot Volume The Bitcoin network feels like a “ghost town,” according to the latest analysis from CryptoQuant, which highlighted a dramatic decline in on-chain and spot market activity. The on-chain analytics platform stated that Bitcoin’s Network Activity Index has plunged to just 3.47k, which is one of the lowest levels seen in the past 18 months. Retail demand has also taken a hit as on-chain transactions involving amounts under $10,000, which is often used to gauge retail participation, have dropped by more than 5%. Meanwhile, spot trading volume on centralized exchanges has fallen to a 4.5-year low, to levels last seen in October 2020. CryptoQuant further stated that real Bitcoin is barely moving, both on-chain and across exchanges, even as ETF demand remains relatively steady. Despite this slump in visible activity, a total of 847,200 BTC has transitioned to the long-term holder supply, suggesting that coins are being held rather than traded. These holdings have remained untouched for over 155 days, which echoes similar accumulation patterns seen in late 2024. Ethereum Futures Heat Up While Bitcoin’s spot and on-chain metrics remain muted, the derivatives market is telling a different story, especially for Ethereum. ETH open interest on futures platforms has soared to a record 7.17 million ETH, and retail trading frequency on futures has also spiked above its one-year average. This reflects a growing shift in investor attention from spot markets to futures, particularly visible among retail participants. While the surface-level data shows a stagnant and quiet Bitcoin network, deeper metrics reveal a market in wait mode, with long-term conviction among holders and rising speculative energy in derivatives markets. For now, Bitcoin may feel deserted , but CryptoQuant hints this could be the calm before a major move – a silent buildup before volatility returns.

2025-06-11T11:09:47,"Victims drag World Cup stars to court over crypto NFT scam","In Spain, a high-profile investigation has been opened following a cryptocurrency project endorsed by top football players that is accused of defrauding investors of more than $3.4 million. The probe centers on Shirtum Europa SLU, which disappeared soon after advertising inactive digital collectibles tied to player image rights. The six footballers named in the criminal complaint, which is now under consideration by the Fifth District Court of Barcelona, are World Cup winners and former Barcelona and Sevilla players. They include Alejandro Gomez, Lucas Ocampos, Ivan Rakitic, Javier Saviola, Nico Pareja and Alberto Moreno. They are also accused of deceiving the masses by officially supporting Shirtum, who had no viable platform. The case was filed by 12 alleged victims and reinforced by professional witnesses, which included a financial investigation by reputable economist Prosper Lamothe. Court filings allege that investors were enticed with the promise of exclusive NFTs and speculative profits, only to be stuck with tokens that ultimately failed to develop utility or value. NFTs sold, platform abandoned Shirtum sold its $SHI token as the sole way to buy NFTs linked to the personal brands of huge football stars. There were digital items that cost more than $500. However, since there was no support to trade or withdraw them from the marketplace, users could not. Court filings allege that the platform’s developers established a purposefully complex business model between Spain and Andorra. The purpose, investigators claim, was to avoid taxes and protect founders against liability. The key protagonists of the operation are Argentine businessman David Rozencwaig and Catalan businessmen Manel Angel Torras, Marc Alberto Torras, and Manuel Morillas. The appearance of the players as co-founders and the faces of the project on its publicity vaulted public confidence in the project. Papu Gomez reportedly played an essential role, using personal relations to bring on board other stars to popularize the platform. According to the complaint, after the downfall of Shirtum, the players deleted posts about their participation on social media. In 2022, Shirtum claimed that company funds had been drained following a cyberattack, although police reports were never made. Investigators have since become suspicious that the said funds could have been diverted to personal use. Omegapro tied to global football endorsements Shirtum is not the first crypto-related program to feature football stars. A separate investigation published by El Diario shows that at least 20 current and former professional players are being sued due to their promotional involvement in Omegapro, an alleged worldwide Ponzi scheme that raised at least 3 billion euros in investor funds. Omegapro promised 300% returns in 14 months on crypto investments and ran massive campaigns with sports celebrities such as Ronaldinho, Kaka, Luis Figo, Iker Casillas, Carles Puyol, Roberto Carlos, and Vinicius Jr. Victim legal teams claim that celebrity endorsements were a critical factor in gaining trust and victimizing people around the world. Several football players are currently under scrutiny over possible deception of the masses through their linkage with unlicensed financial activities. Crypto fraud landscape expands with celebrity and AI tactics The Shirtum and Omegapro situation is aligned with a bigger trend of fraudulent crypto schemes using famous celebrities to lure investors. Analysts warn that sports influencers and celebrities, especially ones with massive followings among fans, are still exploited or eager accomplices in plans to remove the distinction between promotion and participation. According to a recent study by crypto exchange Bitget, advanced scams are becoming hard to detect. According to the research released in June 2025, scammers stole over $4.6 billion in 2024. That is a 24% rise from the previous year, and nearly 40% of incidents involved AI-created deepfakes. The report points to an increasing number of fraudsters using synthetic media to impersonate executives, generate documents, and construct fake identities. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen noted that these scams are tough to spot due to the convergence of emotional manipulation and advanced visual trickery. She noted that currently, most platforms have a gamified interface, synthesized audit certificate, and social referral mechanisms to achieve viral growth. “Scams today aren’t amateur operations,” said Chen.

A group of eight deputies of Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, submitted a bill which would authorize the country's National Bank to include ""virtual assets in the gold and foreign exchange reserves,"" on Tuesday. The bill's principal sponsor is Yaroslav Zheleznyak, who serves as first deputy chairman of the Committee on Finance, Tax and Customs Policy. Zheleznyak described the bill as a ""step [to] integrate Ukraine into global financial innovations,"" in a post on Telegram. ""Proper management of crypto reserves will help strengthen macroeconomic stability and create new opportunities for the development of the digital economy,"" he added. Zheleznyak noted however that if it became law, the policy would not demand the central bank create a crypto reserve, merely that it would have the option of doing so.

2025-06-11T11:02:44,"XRP Designed to Succeed Bitcoin? David Schwartz Unearthed Statement Drops a Bombshell","In a recent X post, XRP advocates Edo Farina dropped what he calls a “bombshell” revelation: a screenshot dated September 17, 2011, featuring David Schwartz, CTO and Chief Cryptographer of Ripple , saying: “I’ve been working on a Bitcoin successor myself, after seeing what has worked well and what has not worked well.” According to Farina, this statement hints at a key truth: XRP was intentionally crafted to succeed Bitcoin. Drawing from archived comments, historical patent records, and previous reporting, Farina posits that XRP is not merely an alternative to Bitcoin, but its direct and improved heir . “Bitcoin Successor” Straight from the Source Edo Farina, a prominent XRP community figure, resurfaced a nearly decade‑old statement attributed to Schwartz, suggesting that XRP was conceived as a Bitcoin successor, designed to address Bitcoin’s early limitations . While Litecoin, Dogecoin, and countless other tokens sprouted over time, Schwartz’s own words stand out, signaling intent far deeper than mere opportunism. Beyond the screenshot, the dots could be connected to Schwartz’s 1988 patent—a precursor to decentralized ledger architecture. Schwartz’s filing describes a distributed computing system that resembles modern blockchain validation processes. Farina suggests this foresight, coupled with Schwartz’s later work on Bitcoin and the XRP Ledger, reinforces the idea of XRP as an evolved form of the original. From Bitcoin to XRP: A Technical and Ideological Evolution Schwartz’s journey began in early 2011 when he and fellow developers Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto examined Bitcoin’s promise, but were increasingly concerned by its flaws: high energy consumption, slow transaction times, and limited scalability. At that time, Schwartz reportedly noted he was “looking for something new”, and by May 2011, development on XRP was underway. The official launch came in June 2012 . This clear progression, from Bitcoin interest to disillusionment with mining inefficiencies to the creation of XRP, exemplifies a conscious, iterative upgrade. Schwartz and his co-creators sought a protocol with near-instant settlement, minimal fees, and no reliance on energy-intensive mining. XRP as “Bitcoin 2.0” Farina and other XRP proponents view XRP as “Bitcoin 2.0”—the practical, enterprise-ready successor. In a report by TimesTabloid , this thesis is reinforced: XRP was explicitly built to “address Bitcoin’s inefficiencies,” boasting rapid transfers and low costs, rendering it well-suited for global financial adoption. The decentralized yet efficient consensus mechanism of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) operates using validator nodes, enabling transactions every few seconds, unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work congestion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Revelations, Patent Footprints, and Ripple’s Military Meta In the 2000s, Schwartz reportedly worked with the NSA on cryptographic infrastructure. This background, paired with XRPL’s focus on secure payments, leads Farina to question whether XRP was part of a larger, strategic initiative. Bitcoin Founder Speculation – Some XRP community members have speculated that Schwartz might even be—or among—the real Satoshi Nakamoto, noting XRP development began within weeks of Satoshi’s final public communications. Counterpoints: Supply, Decentralization & Bitcoin Maximalism To critics, XRP’s larger supply and different consensus methods undermine its “successor” claim. Schwartz frequently addresses such critiques, emphasizing that unit‑price comparisons are misleading without context; the real metric should be utility and market capitalization. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maximalists have publicly challenged XRP’s decentralization, prompting Schwartz to underscore the XRP Ledger’s governance model and validator diversity. A New Chapter in Crypto Legacy The narrative that XRP is the “real Bitcoin successor” rests on a compelling mix of direct quotes, early patents, developer timelines, and community speculation. Edo Farina’s curation of these elements has sharpened the debate, positioning XRP not as just another altcoin but as a purposeful response to Bitcoin’s shortcomings. Whether one interprets Schwartz’s work as strategic competition, technical evolution, or part of an obscured crypto legacy, XRP’s story is undeniably intertwined with Bitcoin’s foundational ethos. As digital assets evolve, this link validates XRP’s future beyond volatility, rooted in intent, design, and ambition.

2025-06-11T11:00:06,"Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin’s 2021 Cycle? Here’s The Target","With the recent Ethereum price trend, a crypto analyst has pointed out that the altcoin could be looking to stage a similar rally to what was seen with Bitcoin back in 2021. Crypto analyst TradingShot pointed out the similarities in a recent analysis and showing where the price could go if it does play out the same way. Ethereum Looks Like Bitcoin Did In 2021 In the analysis posted on TradingView, crypto analyst TradingShot showed how this Ethereum cycle movement looked similar to Bitcoin’s 2021 cycle movement. The first of this was recovery from a major price crash that led to new cycle lows for the cryptocurrency, before staging a recovery that pushed it toward new highs. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Still Coming? Why Bitcoin Is To Blame Despite Making ATHs For Bitcoin, the crash happened when the COVID-19 lockdown was announced. Following this, the Bitcoin price had fallen more than 50% from above $9,000 to less than $4,000 in less than one month. However, after this, the Bitcoin price rebounded from the cycle lows, crossing the 1-week MA50, and then breaking the lower high trendline, and going on to reach new all-time highs. For Ethereum, the crypto analyst pointed to the price crash triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff wars as being similar to Bitcoin’s COVID crash. After Donald Trump announced tariffs on other countries, the Ethereum price also crashed by a large margin, going from above $2,400 to below $1,500 in less than a month. This has been dubbed the ‘Trade War Crash’, and the altcoin is still reeling from the decline. Currently, the Ethereum price is stuck at the point where it is still trying to break above the 1-week MA50, which is now the major level to beat to confirm this trend. Just like Bitcoin, it has also seen the formation of major resistance at the lower highs, and this sits right at the $4,200 level. This means the Ethereum price still has around a 50% rally to complete before it confirms a similar trend to Bitcoin. How High ETH Price Could Go If It Plays Out If Ethereum does reclaim the 1W 50MA and then breaks the lower highs at $4,200, confirming this trend, then the resulting rally could be exceptional. For example, after breaking the lower highs, the Bitcoin price went on to reach new all-time highs of $69,000 in 2021. This means that the price went from below $4,000 to $69,000 in the space of a year. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric A similar rally would mean that the Ethereum price would rise above $10,000. Taking the same timelines into position, it would put ETH at this price sometime in 2026, a year from when the Trade Wars crash had occurred. A closer parabolic rally and an imitation of Bitcoin’s 1,700% rally would mean a price tag above $15,000 for the second-largest cryptocurrency in the space.

2025-06-11T11:00:03,"AI Regulation: Mastering Global Policy for Startup Success","BitcoinWorld AI Regulation: Mastering Global Policy for Startup Success Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping industries, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation and growth. For startups, leveraging AI can be the key to gaining a competitive edge, streamlining operations, and reaching new markets. However, this transformative power comes with significant challenges, particularly when navigating the complex landscape of AI regulation and policy across different jurisdictions. The journey from a local operation to successful global expansion requires a deep understanding of how AI technologies intersect with evolving legal frameworks. At a recent Bitcoin World Sessions event focused on AI, a breakout discussion brought together experts to delve into these critical issues. They explored how startups can not only survive but thrive amidst regulatory uncertainty, using AI-driven tools for enhanced digital trade , robust compliance, and efficient startup scaling . This article expands on those insights, providing a comprehensive guide for founders, investors, and policymakers grappling with the realities of the AI policy environment. What are the Key AI Policy Challenges for Startups? The rapid pace of AI development often outstrips the speed at which regulations can be drafted and implemented. This creates a dynamic and sometimes unpredictable environment for startups. Key challenges include: Lack of Harmonization: Different countries and regions are developing their own unique sets of AI rules, leading to a patchwork of requirements that can be difficult for a single startup to track and comply with across multiple markets. Defining AI: There is no universally agreed-upon legal definition of AI, which can create ambiguity about which technologies and applications fall under specific regulations. Data Privacy and Security: AI systems often rely on vast amounts of data. Complying with diverse global data protection laws (like GDPR, CCPA, etc.) while training and deploying AI models is a major hurdle. Bias and Fairness: Regulations are emerging to address potential biases in AI decision-making processes. Startups must implement measures to ensure their AI systems are fair and non-discriminatory, which requires careful data management and model validation. Liability: Determining who is responsible when an AI system causes harm or makes an error is a complex legal question that startups must consider, especially as regulations around AI liability evolve. Transparency and Explainability: Some regulations may require AI systems to be explainable or transparent in their decision-making, which can be challenging for complex ‘black box’ models. How Can Startups Leverage AI for Digital Trade and Global Expansion? Despite the policy challenges, AI offers powerful tools that can directly facilitate digital trade and enable smoother global expansion . Startups can strategically deploy AI in several areas: Automated Compliance Monitoring: AI-powered platforms can monitor changes in global regulations, alerting startups to new requirements related to data, privacy, specific AI uses (e.g., facial recognition, credit scoring), and trade restrictions. Optimizing Cross-Border Logistics and Supply Chains: AI can predict demand, optimize shipping routes, manage inventory across different regions, and navigate customs procedures more efficiently. Personalized Customer Experiences at Scale: AI enables tailored marketing, product recommendations, and customer support localized for different markets, improving conversion rates and customer satisfaction during startup scaling . Fraud Detection and Security: AI algorithms can analyze transaction patterns and user behavior to detect fraudulent activities and enhance security measures in cross-border transactions. Market Research and Localization: AI can analyze vast amounts of data from different markets to identify opportunities, understand local preferences, and assist with content localization and translation. Utilizing these AI capabilities allows startups to navigate the complexities of international markets more effectively, reducing manual effort and mitigating risks associated with digital trade . What Strategies Help Navigate AI Regulation and Ensure Compliance? Successfully managing AI regulation requires a proactive and strategic approach. Startups cannot afford to view compliance as an afterthought. Experts recommend several key strategies: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor regulatory developments in target markets. Subscribe to legal updates, follow relevant government agencies, and engage with industry associations. Build Compliance into Product Development: Design AI systems with privacy, fairness, and transparency in mind from the outset (Privacy by Design, Ethics by Design). This is far more efficient than trying to retrofit compliance later. Invest in Legal and Compliance Expertise: Even small startups should seek advice from legal professionals specializing in AI and data regulation, especially when planning global expansion . Implement Robust Data Governance: Establish clear policies for data collection, storage, use, and deletion. Ensure data used for training AI models is ethically sourced and compliant with relevant laws. Conduct Regular Audits and Risk Assessments: Periodically review AI systems for compliance with current regulations and assess potential risks related to bias, security, and privacy. Engage with Policymakers: Where possible, participate in consultations and provide feedback on proposed AI policy . Sharing real-world challenges and innovations can help shape more effective and balanced regulations. These steps are crucial for building trust with users and regulators, paving the way for sustainable startup scaling . Expert Insights from Bitcoin World Sessions: AI The discussion at Bitcoin World Sessions highlighted the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing. Speakers emphasized that while the regulatory landscape is fragmented, there are common principles emerging, particularly around data governance, transparency, and accountability. They noted that startups already dealing with the complexities of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency regulation may have a head start in understanding distributed compliance challenges. One key takeaway was the need for flexibility. Regulations will continue to evolve, and startups must build adaptable systems and processes. Another point raised was the potential for AI itself to help manage compliance, using natural language processing to analyze legal texts or machine learning to identify compliance gaps in internal processes. The experts also stressed the importance of focusing on ethical AI development, not just legal compliance. Building trustworthy AI systems fosters user adoption and can provide a competitive advantage in markets increasingly sensitive to how technology impacts society. Navigating AI policy is not just about avoiding penalties; it’s about building a responsible and sustainable business for long-term startup scaling . Conclusion: Mastering the AI Policy Maze for Global Success The intersection of AI, policy, and global business presents a formidable challenge for startups. However, by understanding the nuances of AI regulation , leveraging AI tools for efficient digital trade , adopting proactive compliance strategies, and staying informed about evolving AI policy , startups can successfully navigate this complex environment. The insights shared at events like Bitcoin World Sessions underscore that informed decision-making, ethical development, and strategic investment in compliance are paramount for achieving significant startup scaling and sustainable global expansion in the age of AI.

2025-06-11T10:57:43,"Ukraine Proposes Law to Hold Bitcoin in National Reserves","The post Ukraine Proposes Law to Hold Bitcoin in National Reserves appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ukraine is taking a bold step toward financial innovation. A new draft bill has been introduced in the Ukrainian Parliament that could allow the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in its national reserves. Ukrainian Lawmakers Push Pro-Crypto Legislation On June 10, 2025 , Ukrainian lawmakers submitted a draft law titled: “Draft Law on Amendments to the Law of Ukraine On the National Bank of Ukraine regarding the inclusion of virtual assets in the gold and foreign exchange reserves of Ukraine. This bill was proposed by several members of the Verkhovna Rada, including Yaroslav Zhelezniak , Oleksiy Zhmerenetskyi , Maksym Buzhanskyi , and others. Zhelezniak confirmed the development through his official Telegram channel, calling it a step forward in modernizing Ukraine’s financial infrastructure. What Does the Ukraine Crypto Bill Propose? The proposed legislation does not mandate the NBU to buy or hold crypto assets. Instead, it gives the central bank the legal option to include digital assets like Bitcoin in its gold and foreign exchange reserves. “How, when, and how much should be the decision of the regulator itself,” Zhelezniak clarified. Why This Move Matters for Ukraine With the ongoing war against Russia, Ukraine’s economy faces severe stress—GDP contraction, infrastructure damage, and dependence on foreign aid. The move to legalize crypto reserves could: Support macroeconomic stability Attract foreign investment Encourage digital innovation Help integrate Ukraine into the global economy Strategic Crypto Reserves: A Global Trend? Ukraine is not alone. Countries worldwide are exploring crypto reserves: In March 2025 , the United States launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 . Switzerland and Hong Kong have introduced crypto-friendly policies. Brazil is reportedly considering its own Bitcoin reserve . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why MARA Stock Could Outperform Bitcoin in This Bull Market , Why Countries in Crisis Turn to Crypto For countries facing economic instability or conflict , crypto offers: Access to global markets Bypass traditional banking restrictions Hedge against inflation and currency collapse Empower digital economic growth Ukraine follows the path of others like: Pakistan , which created a Crypto Council in March 2025 and later allocated energy for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers . El Salvador , where economic instability led to historic adoption of Bitcoin. Final Thoughts If passed, Ukraine’s crypto bill could be a turning point—marking the country’s deeper alignment with global financial innovation . Allowing the central bank to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset could not only strengthen the economy but also position Ukraine as a crypto-forward nation in the post-war recovery phase. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-11T10:52:55,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-11: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, RIPPLE: XRP, INTERNET COMPUTER: ICP, ARBITRUM: ARB","The crypto market registered a marginal increase, rising nearly 1% as Bitcoin (BTC) stabilized around $109,000-$110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency dipped to a low of $108,436 late on Tuesday but recovered to reach $110,393 before moving to its current level of $109,562. BTC is marginally up over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continued to push higher, briefly crossing $2,800 before moving to its current level of $2,793, up nearly 4%. Ripple (XRP) registered a marginal drop, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 4%, having crossed $160, trading around $164. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 2%, and Cardano (ADA) is up nearly 2%, trading around $0.718. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. However, Toncoin (TON) is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $2.39. Markets Rise As US-China Trade Talks Continue US stocks continued rising for a second day as trade talks between the US and China continued in London. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.25%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.55%. The Nasdaq gained 0.63% and is now 285 points away from reclaiming the 20,000 level. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said negotiations between the US and China were going well, indicating a resolution may be close. Export controls remain a key point of discussion, with the US pressing Beijing to release rare earth materials while China is pushing for easing access to American semiconductors. However, Wall Street remains cautious, with investors waiting for a breakthrough in talks. Meanwhile, Chinese markets showed renewed volatility, registering a sudden dip in equities on Tuesday. Australia Uncovers Crypto Laundering Scheme Australian authorities have uncovered a crypto laundering scheme following an 18-month investigation into a 190 million Australian Dollar ($123 million) operation running via a cash-in-transit security company. The Australian Federal Police stated they had frozen $13.6 million worth of assets across Queensland and New South Wales. The investigation began in December 2023 and uncovered an operation using an armored vehicle unit of a security business that acted as a front to launder criminal proceeds into crypto. Suspicious transactions from one individual who allegedly laundered over $9.5 million led authorities to a complex money laundering scheme masquerading as a legitimate business activity. Authorities have accused the security company of blending clean business earnings with illicit cash and funneling the funds through a sales promotion company, a classic car dealership, and crypto exchanges. While blockchain technology can modernize financial systems, its open and decentralized nature attracts criminals. According to data from Chainalysis, over $100 billion worth of crypto flowed from illicit wallets to conversion services between 2019 and 2024. Additionally, criminals have started using crypto mixers, DeFi protocols, and cross-chain bridges to launder funds and evade detection. Despite these drawbacks, the blockchain’s transparency is a powerful tool to track illicit funds. SEC Working On Framework To Boost Crypto Innovation The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is working on an “innovation exemption” to facilitate the creation of on-chain products and services. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said on Monday during the crypto roundtable, headed by the SEC’s crypto task force, that he had directed SEC staff to consider a conditional exemption relief framework. According to Atkins, the temporary exemptions would relieve firms from specific regulatory requirements, helping foster innovation in emerging sectors, provided they meet the necessary conditions. Atkins believes this would speed up bringing on-chain products and services to the market while the SEC considers amendments to the Commission’s rules and regulations. “An innovation exemption could help fulfill President Trump’s vision to make America the crypto capital of the planet by encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, and other firms that are willing to comply with certain conditions to innovate with on-chain technologies in the United States.” Atkins has also asked staff to consider if amendments to the Commission’s rules and regulations would provide the needed accommodation for issuers and intermediaries looking to administer on-chain financial systems. “Most current securities rules and regulations are premised upon the regulation of issuers and intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, advisers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries.” CFPB’s Top Enforcement Official Resigns The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s top enforcement official has quit after accusing the Trump administration of undermining the agency’s mission and functioning in a scathing resignation email. Cara Peterson, the agency’s acting enforcement director, said that the Trump administration’s overhaul of the agency, including attempts to cut 90% of its workforce has made it impossible to ensure financial products are transparent, fair, and competitive for consumers. Peterson stated in her email, “I have served under every director and acting director in the bureau’s history, and never before have I seen the ability to perform our core mission so under attack. It has been devastating to see the bureau’s enforcement function being dismantled through thoughtless reductions in staff, inexplicable dismissals of cases, and terminations of negotiated settlements that let wrongdoers off the hook.” The CFPB handles complaints about US crypto exchanges and related companies. A weakening of the agency could lead to less oversight and more uncertainty in an industry plagued with fraud and scams. The CFBP’s dismantling reflects a broader pattern of regulatory unpredictability under the Trump administration. Peterson added that President Trump has no intention of enforcing the law in any meaningful way. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has stalled after reaching $110,000, with bulls unable to push the price higher. BTC crossed $110,000 on Monday but lost momentum and fell to $108,335 on Tuesday, leading to speculations of a decline to $105,000 or lower. However, it recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253 before dropping during the ongoing session. Market experts and investors are waiting for the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which could bring volatility to BTC. BTC soared to within touching distance of its all-time high before ultimately falling short. However, analysts expect the flagship cryptocurrency to surge to a new all-time high if current bullish sentiment persists. Some analysts believe market expectations of BTC surging to a new all-time high could prevent it from happening in the near term. According to Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivian, there is growing anticipation for BTC to reach a new all-time high on social media. However, he pointed out that since the market moves opposite to the expectation of retail traders, it isn’t quite ready for another bullish surge. Quinlivian stated, “It wouldn’t be surprising if we do break through very soon after we see a few frustrating ‘close calls’ that cause small traders to turn sour and impatient on BTC, neutralizing this level of optimism.” Analysts also pointed out that historically, Q3 has been Bitcoin’s weakest, with returns averaging just over 6%. However, Q4 ranks among the strongest, delivering average returns of over 85%. Derive Head of Research Dr Sean Dawson believes BTC will likely underperform during the third quarter, highlighting macroeconomic uncertainty as a significant concern for investors. Dawson stated, “Despite political pressure for rate cuts, the Fed seems poised to keep interest rates steady, which could dampen Bitcoin’s appeal for outsized returns.” BTC traded in positive territory the previous weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,779. The price fell to an intraday low of $103,768 on Monday before recovering to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price dropped almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at 104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Source: TradingView BTC recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $104,378. Buyers retained control over the weekend as the price rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC started the week positively, rising over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,251. The price fell to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday before recovering to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. The current session sees BTC down almost 1%, trading around $109,406, as sellers look to lower the price. Buyers will look to regain control and push BTC past $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) recovered from a sluggish start to Tuesday to register a substantial increase and cross $2,800 as bullish sentiment around the asset intensified thanks to growing institutional interest. However, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is back in the red during the ongoing session and is down over 1%, trading around $2,780. While ETH is trading in positive territory, new data from Kraken suggests it could face heightened volatility after ETH's open interest surged to an all-time high, indicating an increase in speculative activity. Alexia Theodorou, head of derivatives at Kraken, stated, “Open interest in ETH perpetual on Kraken reached an all-time high of 30,000 ETH earlier this week, signaling a notable uptick in speculative activity around the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.” The spike in derivatives activity is likely due to growing institutional inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs. “While funding rates remain mildly bullish, the market has yet to form a clear directional consensus, with the long/short ratio still well below its January peak.” ETH price action was mixed the previous weekend as it registered a marginal drop on Saturday before rising 0.44% on Sunday to settle at $2,539. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price registered an increase of almost 3% to cross the 20-day SMA and $2,600 and settle at $2,607. ETH registered a marginal drop on Tuesday as buyers lost momentum but recovered on Wednesday to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,607. Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as ETH plunged over 7%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $2,415. Despite the bearish sentiment, ETH recovered on Friday, rising 2.63% to $2,479. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price rose almost 2% to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,525. However, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, dropping 0.57% to $2,511. ETH started the week on a bullish note, surging almost 7% to cross the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settle at $2,680. Bullish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as the price rose over 5% to cross $2,800 and settle at $2,816. The current session sees ETH down 1.53%, trading around $2,774. If sellers retain control, the price could slip to $2,500 or lower. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continued its upward trajectory despite facing selling pressure on Tuesday and falling to a low of $156. However, it rebounded to reclaim $160 and settle at $165. The altcoin has extended its gains during the ongoing session, with the price marginally up, trading around $165. The positive sentiment around the asset is due to reports that the SEC may approve a Solana ETF within the next few months. The regulator has asked prospective issuers to submit amended S-1 registration statements by next week. According to sources, the SEC will comment on the updated filings within 30 days. The changes in the filings center around two key areas: How issuers will handle in-kind redemptions and whether staking will be incorporated into the ETF structure. Several asset managers, including VanEck, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, and 21Shares, are planning to offer Solana ETFs. SOL faced selling pressure the previous weekend but registered a marginal increase on Saturday and rose almost 1% on Sunday to settle at $157. It lost momentum on Monday, dropping to a low of $151 before settling at $156, ultimately registering a marginal increase. SOL raced to an intraday high of $164 on Tuesday but could not stay at this level and fell to $155. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.29% to $153. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL plunged nearly 6%, slipping below $150 and settling at $144. Despite the selling pressure, SOL recovered on Friday, rising 2.47% to $147. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control over the weekend as SOL rose 1.51% on Saturday and 1.56% on Sunday to reclaim $150 and settle at $152.

However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 2.44% and settle at $165. The current session sees the price up almost 1%, trading around $166. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) is also trading in positive territory after increasing significantly over the past few sessions. XRP bulls are setting their sights on a move to $2.50 and beyond as odds for an XRP ETF jumped to 98% on Polymarket. Multiple XRP ETF applications from major players, including Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares, signal strong demand for regulated XRP investment vehicles.

2025-06-11T10:51:16,"XRP Created Thousands of Millionaires: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Same Opportunity with 233% Guaranteed Launch Returns","The post XRP Created Thousands of Millionaires: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Same Opportunity with 233% Guaranteed Launch Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2017, XRP shocked the crypto world by turning average investors into millionaires seemingly overnight. For those who missed that golden run, another opportunity may already be unfolding—one with even more upside, and this time, it’s built on stronger tech and real accessibility. Meet Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a new asset surging in both hype and substance—and currently sitting at just $7 in its presale phase. XRP Was Just the Beginning XRP’s explosive rise to $2.19 and beyond created more than just financial gains—it birthed a generation of early believers who cashed in when the world least expected it. While XRP still plays a role in the altcoin space, its growth curve has matured. Meanwhile, new contenders are stepping up—especially ones like Bitcoin Solaris that offer next-gen infrastructure, unmatched scalability, and a launch strategy engineered for wealth generation. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just promising a moonshot. It’s building the launchpad. Why Bitcoin Solaris Feels Like a Once-in-a-Decade Opportunity At its core, Bitcoin Solaris offers a technological evolution rooted in a dual-consensus hybrid model—a base layer secured by Proof of Work (PoW) for resilience, and an upper Solaris Layer powered by high-speed Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). The result? A robust blockchain that delivers over 10,000 TPS, while consuming 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin. But tech alone isn’t why BTC-S is capturing headlines. Its appeal is built around mobile-first accessibility, intuitive mining, and most importantly—an economic model designed to make its users rich. Built-in validator rotation system ensures fairness and decentralization. Smart contracts are fully audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins to meet enterprise-grade standards. Its low entry cost during presale is already drawing comparisons to early Bitcoin and Solana phases. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Mining Reimagined for Normal People What if mining wasn’t reserved for big rigs and massive energy bills? Bitcoin Solaris is breaking the mold through its upcoming Solaris Nova App , which allows users to mine from smartphones, desktops, and even browsers. Backed by adaptive algorithms, built-in security, and gamification features, it’s not just mining—it’s a movement. Whether you’re a casual user or hardcore enthusiast, BTC-S makes mining simple, secure, and profitable without needing a warehouse of hardware. 233% Launch Returns? Why This Presale Is Turning Heads With less than 8 weeks remaining in its presale window, Bitcoin Solaris is gaining unprecedented momentum. Over 11,000 users have already jumped in, pushing the raise over $4.1 million with no signs of slowing down. At the current $7 price, investors are positioning themselves ahead of a $20 launch, locking in a 233% return before the public even gets access. BTC-S isn’t just another presale—it’s one of the shortest and most explosive we’ve seen this cycle. Bitcoin Solaris is also becoming a staple in YouTube crypto circles. A detailed review by 2Bit Crypto outlines why so many investors believe this project is uniquely positioned for breakout success. How Bitcoin Solaris Could Make You Rich When people talk about wealth creation in crypto, it often centers around timing. But BTC-S is making a new argument: it’s not just about when you invest—it’s about what you invest in. Bitcoin Solaris is built for real-world scaling: Instant finality in under 2 seconds Cross-chain bridges enabling DeFi expansion Decentralized governance built into the core protocol Mobile-first strategy enabling millions to mine Add a low entry point and massive upside potential—and BTC-S starts looking like the smartest $1,000 you could deploy in 2025. Roadmap That Supports Long-Term Value BTC-S isn’t a pump-and-dump. It’s backed by a clearly structured roadmap that spans eight phases, including: Q3 2026: Full launch of the mainnet and Solaris Nova app Q4 2026: Mining Power Marketplace goes live 2027: Layer-2 scaling, DEX launch, and Fortune 500 partnerships 2028+: AI integrations and blockchain education initiatives Each milestone positions BTC-S to expand its ecosystem and multiply its real-world use cases. Final Verdict If you missed XRP’s moonshot, you now have a second chance—one with more transparency, better tech, and a presale price that feels like a throwback to 2011. Bitcoin Solaris has the infrastructure, team, and momentum to deliver not just 2X or 5X—but real 20X potential. All you need is to act before this window closes.

2025-06-11T10:39:01,"Trump Sons Hoard Bitcoin, Top Altcoins to Surge from Token Acquisitions","You don’t get to be one of the richest and most powerful men in the world by giving up good opportunities. That’s a lesson Trump seems to have taught his sons well – they’re currently out buying Bitcoin, and have amassed a stockpile of $23.7M in $BTC. But is that the smartest play in crypto right now? Even Strategy’s much-vaunted plan to add to its ever-growing 528K Bitcoin stockpile is risky, with experts warning that it might actually decrease demand for Bitcoin from central banks . While the Trumps are buying BTC, you should snap up these altcoins for some major gains flying under the Bitcoin radar. Yet Another Trump/Bitcoin Headline When Donald Trump said he’d be the first Crypto President, no one knew what he meant. Now, it seems like the US president and his family are rapidly becoming an integral part of the crypto ecosystem, from the $TRUMP meme coin to the ill-fated Trump crypto wallet launch . Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump are both spearheading a new Bitcoin treasury corporation. The simply-named American Bitcoin is a crypto mining company planning to gather as much Bitcoin as possible. In the words of its SEC filing: ABTC considers its Bitcoin holdings to be long-term in nature and expects to continue accumulating Bitcoin. ABTC has not set any specific target for the amount of Bitcoin it seeks to hold… Bitcoin accumulation is not a side effect of ABTC’s business. It is the business. — American Bitcoin SEC filing , American Bitcoin The company’s off to a small start, with only 215 bought $BTC so far, but intends to add to that portfolio aggressively. And whether intentional or not, ABTC is actually proving a larger narrative, one that Swiss crypto bank Sygnum says is crucial for the continued health of the crypto economy. Could Big Bitcoin Treasuries Be Bad? Sygnum discussed the impact of large-scale Bitcoin treasuries like Strategy and highlightedt hat Strategy currently owns roughly 3% of all the Bitcoin that will ever be made. The company also said that ‘large, concentrated holdings are a risk for any asset,’ with Strategy’s stockpile ‘approaching a point where they become problematic.’ Why? Partly because of normal market economics and sentiment. Decreased liquid supply, caused by companies holding $BTC in large treasuries, can increase volatility. There’s also the psychological impact on the market; if Strategy should ever sell any of their $BTC, the headline ‘Strategy Sells Bitcoin’ might be enough to send the price plummeting. Just as the opposite headline is causing bull rushes in the market nowadays And for both those reasons, large-scale treasuries like Strategy’s might demotivate central banks to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. So what’s an honest investor to do? In this case, don’t follow the Trumps. Instead, take a look at these best altcoins to buy in a market that’s still indecisive about Bitcoin’s impact. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Layer-2 Has Arrived Solaxy ($SOLX) solves Solana’s lingering problems. Yes, Solana is fast, and yes, it’s cheap (when compared to Ethereum’s notorious gas fees). But it’s also prone to congestion and the occasional failed transaction, and simply can’t keep up with Ethereum’s scalability. Enter Solaxy, the first-ever Solana Layer-2 solution. It brings faster transaction speeds, zero execution failures, and a multichain architecture and token. $SOLX will launch on Ethereum and be bridgeable to Solaxy when the Layer-2 fully deploys. Solaxy forms the next evolution of the always-expanding Solana ecosystem. It will combine Ethereum’s strength and reliability with Solana’s speed, providing an unparalleled advantage for new crypto projects and meme coin launches. With only 5 days left in the ongoing presale, check out our price prediction to see why we think the $SOLX price could rise from its current $0.001752 to $0.032 by the end of 2025, increasing by 1,700%. Learn how to buy $SOLX , and don’t miss out on a presale that has already raised $47M. Visit the Solaxy presale page . 2. XRP ($XRP) – Ripple’s Leading Altcoin Expands to EVM XRP has notched a number of wins recently, including: Launch of an EVM sidechain Rumors of potential XRP integration with European Central Bank (ECB) Partnership with Guggenheim to launch digital commercial paper It all helps to explain why the number of transactions on XRP experienced a recent spike. $XRP is up 14% year-to-date, with possibilities of a spot ETF lingering on the horizon, a move that boosted demand for $BTC and $ETH last year. XRP is one of the original mainstays of the crypto ecosystem, launched way back in 2012. It’s become a frequently-used tool for cross-border payments. Check out XRP’s whitepaper and technical details to learn more about the world’s fourth-largest crypto. 3. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Sniff Out Top Solana Meme Coins, Profit with Snorter Bot The best meme coins often start small – even underground, on platforms Telegram.

2025-06-11T10:37:29,"HYPE Surges 250% & SOL Eyes $152 Breakout: BlockDAG’s $0.0018 Entry with 25% Referral Rewards Outpaces Both","What happens when one coin hits $35, another eyes $152, and a third starts compounding gains before even launching? The crypto market is delivering answers in real time. Solana’s price recovery is building steam after bouncing from $141.19 support, with analysts watching for a breakout above $152 to confirm that V-shaped reversal. Hyperliquid continues holding above $35 despite its 250% yearly surge, while on-chain data shows buying pressure still outweighs selling. Taking a different approach entirely is BlockDAG (BDAG) . With BDAG priced under $0.002 and a 25% referral system letting early buyers stack coins instantly, this could be that rare pre-launch opportunity. The June 13 GO LIVE reveal is approaching fast. Solana: When Momentum Coins Show Real Strength Solana’s price recovery isn’t happening in isolation. Hyperliquid (HYPE) just delivered a stunning 250% rally, rocketing from $10 to $37 and now trading above $35. While technical indicators like MACD and RSI suggest some near-term cooling might be ahead, the overall bullish framework remains intact. What’s particularly interesting is how on-chain data tells a different story than the overbought RSI readings above 90. Buy orders are still outpacing sells, indicating that demand hasn’t dried up despite the massive run. Both HYPE and Solana demonstrate how momentum-driven assets can maintain their upward trajectory when key support levels hold and community sentiment stays strong. HYPE’s Critical Test: Will $35 Support Hold After Monster Rally? Hyperliquid’s 250% surge from $10 has traders laser-focused on the $35 level. This price point has become the make-or-break zone that could determine whether HYPE pushes back toward $37 or faces a sharper correction. Technical indicators are flashing mixed signals, with overbought conditions battling against persistent buying pressure. The real story lies in the price action structure. HYPE continues printing higher highs and higher lows across multiple timeframes, suggesting the bullish trend hasn’t been broken. If profit-taking accelerates and pushes the price below $34, things could get interesting fast. However, the consistent buying interest on every pullback suggests this momentum play might have more room to run. BlockDAG’s 25% Referral Bonus: The Early Bitcoin Opportunity You Can’t Ignore BlockDAG’s current 25% referral program is transforming casual crypto conversations into serious coin accumulation. When someone you refer purchases $400 worth of BDAG tokens, you instantly receive $100 worth of coins in your balance. There’s no waiting period, no complex unlock schedules, just immediate rewards that hit your account automatically. With BDAG currently priced at just $0.0018 until June 13, this represents one of the final low entry opportunities before exchange listings begin. The presale has already generated approximately $294.3 million in funding, with over 22.1 billion BDAG tokens distributed to early participants. Current holders are looking at projected returns of 2,520% compared to Batch 1 pricing, and with a rumored listing price target of $0.05, those gains could multiply significantly. This is why BlockDAG is earning recognition as the next explosive crypto opportunity, with fundamentals aligning before public trading even begins. The platform’s appeal extends beyond price speculation. The X1 Miner app boasts 1.5 million active users who earn daily BDAG rewards through their smartphones without gas fees. Combined with CertiK security auditing and high-profile partnerships including Inter Milan and a rumored NBA collaboration, BlockDAG has built institutional-grade credibility that most early-stage projects never achieve. The Future of Crypto Hyperliquid continues defying gravity above $35 despite its massive 250% run, with on-chain data showing buyers remain engaged even as technical indicators suggest cooling ahead. Solana’s recovery momentum is building toward a crucial test at $152, where bulls hope to lock in that V-shaped reversal pattern from the $141 low. For those hunting the next explosive opportunity, BlockDAG’s presale window closes June 13 with BDAG still priced at $0.0018. The 25% referral system is letting early participants stack coins while $294.3 million in funding validates serious interest. With the GO LIVE reveal approaching, this could be that rare second chance to catch lightning before the broader market catches on.

The decentralized exchange token surged over 20% in 24 hours to $8.61 on June 11 — an 84% rise from its April low. UNI market capitalization has now exceeded $5 billion, more than Aave’s. Volume also surged over 150% to $1.39 billion in one day. Technical Indicators Affirm Bullish Momentum The breakout is further cemented by several bullish indications. UNI not only busted the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline but also formed a golden cross earlier this week as the 20-day moving average penetrated above the 50-day. Momentum indicators also affirm the bullish setup: MACD and RSI trending upward Price broke a long-term downtrend of lower highs and lows Long/short ratio remains greater than 1, showing most traders expect further appreciation Open interest on UNI derivatives spiked 54% to $713 million — all-time high If the trend holds, UNI can rally another 37% to around $10.40, which matches the 24.7% Fibonacci retracement level. Uniswap Smart Wallet and Regulatory News Drive Rally Bullish sentiment is also being driven by June 10’s roll-out of Uniswap Labs’ Smart Wallet, which is intended to simplify onchain interactions with amenities like: Gas abstraction Automated token approvals Regulatory optimism has also increased at the same time. On June 9, SEC Chair Paul Atkins stated the agency has a proposed “innovation exemption” in development to facilitate easier entry for DeFi projects. The statement fueled chatter of a potential “DeFi Summer 2.0.” On-Chain Activity and Bitcoin Correlation Uniswap’s network activity reflects this renewed interest. Daily active addresses rose 92% in 24 hours, pointing to rising engagement. UNI’s rally is also tracking Bitcoin’s broader bullish movement, as BTC climbed above $110,000, driven by optimism around U.S.–China trade progress. Key Levels to Watch Despite robust uptrend momentum, buyers are seeking significant support at $8.20, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. This region is often the first defense zone in uptrends. Dropping below $8.20 could lead to short-term consolidation. A break below $7.50 would invalidate the bullish breakout, and UNI could return to $4.70 support. Conclusion Uniswap’s breakout, surge volume, and favorable macro environment suggest a longer-term uptrend to $10.40 — provided key support levels hold.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/uniswap-breaks-out-of-inverse-head-and-shoulders/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|UNI","Blockchain|Sticky",cryptocompare

One of the wallets has been linked to risky trader James Wynn. Whales are floating back to Hyperliquid, opening new long positions. In the past 24 hours, several wallets longed Bitcoin (BTC) as the leading coin showed signs of momentum and the potential to rally to a new all-time high. BTC rallied on Wednesday, easily trading above $109,500. The crypto fear and greed index points to renewed increasing greed. However, most traders are hovering on the threshold between short and long positions. The Hyperliquid whales are showing signs of conviction, with up to 20X to 40X leverage in some cases. The most significant new whale deposited $29.85M in USDC over the past couple of days, with another $10M added in the past few hours. The whale is currently holding a single position with 20X leverage and a liquidation price of $103,710. It seems that James Wynn created a new wallet 6 days ago and continued his bets—going 40x long on $BTC and 10x long on $PEPE . The current unrealized profit exceeds $2M. https://t.co/MFz2JnYH46 https://t.co/lvMfS5nxQG pic.twitter.com/7h0DSadoX6 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 11, 2025 This whale’s position remains anonymous, though it has gained the attention of James Wynn. He has not claimed ownership, but he has given the whale exposure, potentially opening the long position for counter-trading. Wynn’s followers also suggest that he may actually be the whale, despite claiming he lost all his reserves in the previous liquidations. Wynn himself has previously called for other whales to take a similar risk, attempting to make large gains in a single trade going long on BTC. For now, the market has not shown any deliberate efforts to liquidate the position. Two smaller whales closed their BTC positions, then went on to long HYPE, the native token of Hyperliquid. Their liquidation prices for HYPE are as low as $19 and $10.73. Both the BTC and HYPE long whales bet on the same trend of exuberance, as Hyperliquid once again gained attention as the fastest way to tap crypto trends. James Wynn is back with a new wallet James Wynn, the risky trader who was liquidated several times, is most probably back with a new wallet. Previously, Wynn mentioned he would be back on Hyperliquid, though trying to protect his position from liquidation. Hyperliquid traders have logged smaller profits and losses in the past months, though whales still make outsized bets. | Source: Hyperliquid Wynn’s new wallet has a BTC position valued at more than $35M, with a liquidation price of $104,270. For now, the position has not been deliberately attacked, and has an unrealized profit of $1.3M. Wynn has been determined to hold the positions where possible and make even more outsized gains. Previously, he round-tripped a position with up to $100M in unrealized gains. This time around, other whales have surpassed Wynn with their larger positions, but there are few signs of deliberate counter-trading. In total, BTC open interest on Hyperliquid increased to $2.3B, though still below its peak of $4.48B. ETH and SOL open interests are also rising, with an uptick in general meme token and altcoin bets. One of the newly opened ETH positions is going short with 25X leverage, betting on a downward price move. Over time, Hyperliquid is also becoming less volatile, with fewer days of outsized gains, as well as a smaller amount of dramatic liquidations.

Here’s why","XRP has once again become the subject of debate in the cryptocurrency space after blockchain advocate John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) offered a high-profile comparison among XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, the three largest assets in the crypto market. In a recent post, Squire suggested that XRP addresses several of the limitations found in older blockchain systems, specifically those related to speed and efficiency. In his words, “Bitcoin is a landline, Ethereum is a cell phone, XRP is Starlink with no lag.” XRP has often been compared to Tesla and other ventures by Elon Musk, and Squire’s post quickly gained traction on X, with many commenters supporting his view that XRP offers more practical value in areas requiring fast and reliable transaction processing. Bitcoin is a landline, Ethereum is a cell phone, $XRP is Starlink with no lag. — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 8, 2025 Challenging Limitations of Legacy Assets Bitcoin remains constrained by slow block times and a proof-of-work system that is often criticized for its inefficiency. Bitcoin processes new blocks approximately every ten minutes, and a popular crypto YouTuber recently showed a five-hour BTC transaction to highlight the cryptocurrency’s problems. Ethereum, while offering greater functionality through smart contracts, also struggles with high network fees and variable performance under heavy use. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In contrast, XRP is designed to support fast and inexpensive transfers, with an average settlement time of just a few seconds. Transaction costs are typically less than a cent, making it one of the more cost-effective networks available. These attributes have made the asset a popular option among institutions that prioritize transaction speed and operational costs, such as banks and payment service providers. Many experts believe Bitcoin and Ethereum cannot compete with XRP in the global payment space. XRP Army Weighs In Panos Mekras recently questioned why anyone would hold BTC or ETH when XRP is fundamentally better. He described the asset as more sustainable and secure, and the “OG DeFi chain with everything built-in and no smart contract risks.” One commenter noted that Squire’s comparison reflects blockchain’s evolution, stating that Bitcoin laid the foundation, Ethereum added flexibility, and XRP is the next generation with a global reach and real-world utility . Red Cocktail, another commenter, said each currency defines an era, with XRP leading today. He also predicted a massive explosion once the global system shifts to the ISO 20022 standard . Another commenter likened the shift to software cycles, viewing XRP as the most advanced and scalable. While XRP has its skeptics, many supporters believe it is the best asset to lead the market. Although Bitcoin continues to be viewed by many as a long-term store of value, and Ethereum remains central to the dApp development, XRP is best suited for use cases that demand speed and scalability.

With the currency hovering around $107,000, day traders and short sellers being squeezed may add momentum to the surge. In this optimistic atmosphere, interest in pre-sale cryptocurrency options like as Nexchain is increasing. Nexchain has risen to the top of the cryptocurrency presale list, generating more than $4.1 million during its current ICO. Many believe it to be the best crypto presale to buy right now, and it is gaining interest from both experienced investors and beginners looking for fresh crypto token presale opportunities. Whether you’re looking to explore cryptocurrencies on presale or purchase presale crypto, Nexchain provides a unique combination of speed, size, and innovation in the token presale scene. Bitcoin Breakout Prediction: Can It Hit $110,000? According to crypto researcher Van de Poppe, Bitcoin is currently worth slightly over $106,500. He argues that rallies frequently occur when two important variables come together: strong purchasing and short sellers closing bets. As soon as a big price barrier is broken, opportunistic traders rush in, sending prices skyrocketing. He selected $108,900 as the turning point. In previous cycles, getting over that level has resulted in fast movement, fueled by traders closing short positions and fresh buyers joining. Bitcoin has been trading in a tight range for some weeks, so breaching over $106,500 indicates that buyers have regained control. If the current trend continues, a leap above $110,000 is quite plausible, reigniting interest in crypto presale projects that stand to gain from a larger market boom. Nexchain: The AI-Powered Blockchain for Speed and Sustainability Nexchain is a breakthrough pre-sale cryptocurrency based on an AI-powered blockchain. Its presale cryptocurrency tokens are offered at early-stage pricing, which rises with each step. The platform enables next-generation smart contracts and cross-chain interoperability.

The AI layer enables ultra-fast processing—up to 400,000 transactions per second—while preventing network congestion. Transactions are only $0.001, making Nexchain one of the most accessible blockchains in the presale cryptocurrency sector. Its low running costs are complemented by an energy-efficient design, making it a unique green chain on the market. Governance is completely decentralized, with all decisions made by token holders. Community members benefit from the blockchain’s success through a fair allocation of gas fees. Nexchain Pre-Sale Milestone and Audit Nexchain passed a CertiK smart contract audit , getting a 78 out of 100. The project is presently at Stage 17, and NEX tokens are valued at $0.066. The presale has raised $4,142,747 in USDT, indicating strong investor interest. Nexchain’s strong financial and technological base propels it to the top of the crypto ICO presale rankings. It provides both legitimacy and reward in the token presale environment. Final Thoughts: The Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now As Bitcoin approaches $110,000, savvy investors are seeking value-added opportunities in cryptocurrency presale initiatives. Nexchain meets the criteria with AI speed, minimal fees, environmentally sustainable design, and community-led governance.

2025-06-11T10:15:54,"Why Qubetics Is the Top Crypto to Join for 2025 as Solana and Kaspa Redefine Blockchain’s Future","The Blockchain Group is raising over $340 million to grow its Bitcoin treasury, following a recent $68 million BTC purchase. Inspired by U.S.-style “At the Market” offerings, the move signals rising institutional adoption in Europe. It comes as Bitcoin consolidates after hitting an all-time high of $112,000, with similar treasury-driven strategies seen from firms like Strategy, which now plans a $1 billion raise to expand its BTC holdings. Amid rising global economic uncertainty and a surge in digital asset adoption, many are asking which cryptocurrencies stand out as the top cryptos to join for 2025. Qubetics has recently captured significant attention for its innovative approach to solving blockchain scalability and usability issues. Its growing ecosystem promises to meet the demands of businesses and users seeking efficient, secure digital solutions. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market continues to experience regulatory shifts and technological breakthroughs, influencing the performance of established and emerging projects alike. The interplay between market volatility and rapid technological development creates a dynamic environment where only the most adaptable protocols remain relevant. Qubetics , Solana, and Kaspa each bring unique value propositions that align with the future needs of decentralized finance and blockchain applications. Qubetics, in particular, aims to address the shortcomings of previous projects through its advanced development tools and community governance model. This makes these coins essential contenders among the top cryptos to join for 2025, appealing to both technology enthusiasts and digital finance strategists. Qubetics Unlocking Blockchain Potential: The QubeQode and Qubetics IDE Qubetics is distinguished not only by its tokenomics but also by the robust tools powering its ecosystem: QubeQode and the Qubetics Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These innovations serve as critical enablers for businesses, professionals, and developers seeking to adopt blockchain technology with minimal friction. QubeQode offers a streamlined platform to connect smart contracts, decentralized applications, and other blockchain utilities into a cohesive framework. This facilitates operational efficiency and reduces the technical complexity traditionally associated with blockchain deployment. The Qubetics IDE is designed as an all-in-one development suite that supports the creation, testing, and deployment of smart contracts. It is tailored to be user-friendly for those without extensive programming knowledge while retaining advanced features for experienced developers. This combination significantly lowers entry barriers for blockchain adoption in real-world applications. Key Features of QubeQode and Qubetics IDE: Simplified smart contract creation and management Integrated testing environment with real-time debugging Support for multiple programming languages commonly used in blockchain development Enhanced security features aligned with industry best practices Tools designed to accelerate enterprise and individual adoption By providing these tools, Qubetics addresses the limitations of earlier blockchain projects that failed to offer accessible development platforms, positioning itself at the forefront of the top cryptos to join for 2025. Qubetics: Final Crypto Presale Phase Marks a Defining Moment in Blockchain Evolution Qubetics ($TICS) is currently in its 37th crypto presale stage, having sold over 515 million tokens to a growing community exceeding 27,800 holders. The project has successfully raised more than $17.9 million in this ongoing crypto presale phase. At this stage, tokens are priced at $0.3370, with only 10 million $TICS tokens remaining at this fixed price before a 20% price increase occurs upon listing. This shrinking supply is the product of a recent tokenomics overhaul that reduced total supply from over 4 billion tokens to just 1.36 billion, deliberately creating scarcity to enhance long-term value. This strategic realignment amplifies the public sale allocation to 38.55%, shifting token control into the hands of the community and reinforcing Qubetics’ vision of a decentralized, user-governed ecosystem. The project’s governance model emphasizes community-led decision-making and rewards, reflecting a commitment to democratizing blockchain utility and fostering user engagement. Qubetics’ emphasis on scarcity and community control has already attracted analyst predictions projecting substantial post-listing price momentum. Early market analysis highlights limited token supply, robust demand, and a community-first design as key drivers behind this forecast. The current phase of the crypto presale thus represents a critical opportunity for those looking to participate in one of the top cryptos to join for 2025. Qubetics recently announced integration partnerships that extend the capabilities of its QubeQode platform, enabling seamless enterprise adoption. The team also revealed milestones in the Qubetics IDE development, designed to lower barriers for smart contract creation, testing, and deployment. These tools are crafted to support businesses and professionals in harnessing blockchain technology without requiring deep technical expertise, setting Qubetics apart in the crowded crypto market. Charting Your Course with Qubetics: The $5,000 Strategic Play For early investors, the financial appeal of Qubetics is quite strong. A $5,000 at the current price of $0.3370 would secure roughly 14,837 $TICS tokens. When the token officially launches at $0.40, that initial investment would immediately be worth $5,935, netting you a quick $935 profit. But the real excitement comes with the long-term forecasts. If $TICS reaches $5 per token, the $5,000 could swell to $74,185. And if it hits the projected $10 mark, that same investment would yield a remarkable $148,370, representing an astonishing 2,867% return. This presale is a unique chance, offering both immediate gains upon listing and significant potential for long-term growth, making it very appealing to those looking for both quick wins and substantial future returns. Solana (SOL) Surges Over 5% in 24 Hours as Volume Jumps Nearly 74% Solana (SOL), ranked #6 by market cap, is making headlines with a strong 5.21% daily gain, bringing its price to $158.46 and pushing its market cap to $83.18 billion.

2025-06-11T10:11:22,"Extended Crypto Cycle Ahead, Says Bitwise CIO as Bitcoin Hits $110K","The post Extended Crypto Cycle Ahead, Says Bitwise CIO as Bitcoin Hits $110K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Bitcoin surges past $110,000 and the U.S. shifts toward pro-crypto regulation , industry insiders like Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer, Matt Hougan , are predicting a bull market that is likely to be longer and more powerful than before. In a recent post on X, Hougan urged investors to rethink their timelines. The traditional four-year boom-and-bust rhythm may be behind us. Instead, he warns, we’re entering uncharted territory – one where the bull run has room to stretch. So, what’s driving this extended cycle? And how long could it really last? Regulation Eases, Innovation Takes Off Hougan believes the crypto industry is finally breaking free from the restrictions of the past few years. “Applications and real-world use cases were artificially suppressed by the hostile regulatory environment of 2020-2024,” he said. “But the infrastructure kept improving, and is now remarkably robust.” Now that those barriers are falling away, technologies like stablecoins, DeFi, tokenization, and DePin are ready to grow fast . Hougan describes the moment as a “coiled spring”, suggesting that a big surge in adoption could be just around the corner. Bitcoin Hits $110K – Could $150K Be Next? The numbers back him up. Bitcoin’s $110,000 landmark was unthinkable last cycle, and a recovery could push it to $150,000 or beyond. That kind of growth would mark a shift away from the short-lived rallies of the past and show that the market is maturing. Trump’s Return Gives Crypto a Boost The political climate in the U.S. is changing fast. Since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, crypto has seen a sharp turn in its favor. The SEC has dropped multiple cases against crypto companies , and the White House just hosted its first crypto convention. With the government showing more support, institutional investors are stepping in. That’s a big difference from previous cycles, which were largely driven by retail traders. Hougan says this broader backing could help extend the bull run. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Michael Saylor Predicts $1 Million Bitcoin Price, Says Crypto Winter Is Over , “This cycle won’t fade away as it did previously,” he noted. Hougan is confident about what’s next. In a recent interview, he predicted a “fantastic” second half of the year for crypto. With institutional demand on the rise and fewer regulatory hurdles, crypto is finding its place in mainstream finance. Time to Rethink the Crypto Playbook Hougan’s long-term outlook isn’t new. Back in January, he said a crypto winter in 2026 was unlikely. And with Bitcoin’s next halving not expected until 2028, the timeline for the current cycle could stretch far beyond what we’re used to. For investors, that means adjusting to a new kind of market, one that includes big institutions, stronger government support, and a growing list of real-world use cases. The next downturn may still come, but this time, the industry may be more prepared than ever to bounce back. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, the traditional four-year cycle may be over. Many analysts now project the bull run could extend well into 2026, with some long-term forecasts even suggesting beyond. How will easing regulations impact institutional investment in crypto? Easing regulations reduce uncertainty and risk for major financial institutions. This clarity encourages greater institutional adoption, bringing more capital and stability to the crypto market, as seen with Bitcoin ETFs. Could political support like Trump’s return significantly boost crypto prices? Yes, strong political support, exemplified by the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance and favorable appointments, can boost market sentiment, reduce regulatory friction, and attract more institutional and retail investment, thus impacting prices positively.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/extended-crypto-cycle-ahead-says-bitwise-cio-as-bitcoin-hits-110k/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-11T10:10:08,"Connecticut law prohibits the state from investing in Bitcoin (BTC)","Connecticut passed HB-7082, which prohibits the state from accepting, holding, or investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The bill passed the House and Senate unanimously and introduced new requirements for crypto-related remittance agencies to verify parental consent for users under 18 years. The bill, officially titled “An Act Concerning the Regulation of Virtual Currency and State Investments,” imposed a comprehensive ban on the state and local governments from investing in crypto assets. Separate from money transmission, the bill prohibited Connecticut and its political subdivisions from accepting or requiring payment in the form of virtual currency or purchasing, holding, investing in, or establishing a digital currency reserve. It also stipulated that crypto businesses must adhere to strict anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. The bill also regulates minors’ access to certain money-sharing applications by imposing restrictions and duties on those businesses. It generally prohibits any business, beginning on October 1, 2025, from allowing anyone to sponsor, open, or establish a money-sharing application account for a minor unless the business receives an attestation from the person stating that he or she is the minor’s parent. HB7082 imposes two restrictions on crypto custody and control The new law imposed two restrictions on the handling of crypto by businesses that engaged in the transmission of money within Connecticut by receiving, sending, storing, or maintaining custody or control of virtual currency. First, it prohibited the businesses from selling, transferring, assigning, lending, hypothecating, pledging, or otherwise using or encumbering virtual currency stored, held, controlled, maintained by, or under the custody or control of the business on a person’s behalf—except for the sale, transfer of ownership, or assignment at the person’s direction. Second, it limited the current law’s provisions authorizing these crypto-related businesses to use designated agents to provide money transmission services on their behalf. However, regardless of those current authorizations, the bill also prohibited the businesses from directly or indirectly using or engaging any other person, including a virtual currency control services vendor, to store or hold virtual currency for or on behalf of a customer—unless the other person was a licensed money transmitter, a qualified bank or credit union, or approved by the banking commissioner to do so. The bill defined a “virtual currency control services vendor” as someone who controls virtual currency under an agreement with another person who assumes control of this currency on a third person’s behalf. Under existing law, businesses that engaged in money transmission in Connecticut by receiving, sending, storing, or maintaining custody or control of crypto on behalf of another person were required at all times to hold digital assets of the same type and amount owed or obligated to the other person. The bill also specified that this virtual currency was a property interest of any claimants against the crypto businesses on a proportional basis and in the type and amount to which the claimants were entitled, regardless of when the claimants became entitled or the businesses obtained control. Connecticut law requires crypto businesses to disclose transaction data The new law required businesses engaged in money transmission in Connecticut to provide specific disclosures and receipts for these transactions. However, the bill authorized the banking commissioner to waive any of these requirements and approve an alternative disclosure or receipt proposed by a crypto business if he/she determined that the alternative was more appropriate for the business and gave the same information and protection to the public. In the absence of an approved alternative disclosure, the bill required businesses to provide several disclosures before entering into a crypto transaction for, on behalf of, or with a person. Specifically, the businesses must clearly disclose relevant details to the extent applicable to the transaction. The Connecticut new law also requires businesses to give people specific receipts once the transactions are completed. The receipt must include the business’s name, contact information, and a description of how a person may ask a question or file a complaint. The details also include the transaction’s type, date, precise time, and value in U.S. dollars, and any consideration the business charged for the transaction, including any charge, fee, or commission, and the amount of any difference between the price the person paid for the virtual currency and its prevailing market price.

2025-06-11T10:09:17,"Why are crypto coins like Kaia, Jito, Vaulta, and SPX6900 rising?","Cryptocurrencies held steady on Wednesday after the conclusion of China and US talks in London, and as traders waited for the upcoming US May consumer inflation report. This article explores why some coins like Kaia (KAIA), Jito (JTO), Vaulta (A), and SPX6900 (SPX) are rising. Kaia jumps as it enters stablecoin race Kaia is an Asian blockchain company formed from the merger of Klaytn and Finschia earlier this year. The two projects were created by Kakao and LINE, respectively, two of the biggest tech companies in South Korea. Kaia has the lowest transaction costs and high speeds and is widely used by application developers in the country. The KAIA token price surged to a high of $0.1700, its highest point since February, and 85% above its lowest level this year. Its recent surge happened after the developers said that they were entering the stablecoin race by launching the first KRW-backed stablecoin. The announcement came a week after Circle, the creator of USDC went public in the United States in a highly successful offering that has pushed its market cap to over $25 billion. A KRW stablecoin would likely be successful because of the volume that South Koreans transact with on the blockchain. Data shows that they are the third most active users after the United States and China. Kaia price chart | Source: TradingView Vaulta rises as Bullish files for IPO Vaulta, formerly known as EOS, jumped to a high of $0.6910, its highest point since May 30, and 23% above its lowest point this month. This surge happened after Bullish, the crypto project backed by Peter Thiel, filed papers to go public. It joins other exchanges like Gemini and Kraken that have filed to go public this year following the Circle IPO . Vaulta token rose because it has a history with Bullish. Bullish was launched by Block.one, a company that launched the most successful ICO ever. Block was the founder of EOSIO until the relationship soured, with EOS citing underfunding by Block. Vaulta rebranded from EOS this year as it pivoted its business model to now focus on blockchain banking. Jito price rises amid asset and fee growth Jito, the biggest liquid staking platform on Solana, surged to a high of $2.3090 on Wednesday, its highest point since April 2nd. It has jumped by 50% from its lowest point in April. Data shows that the amount staked in Jito has continued rising this week. It now has over $2.97 billion in assets, up from $2.6 billion last week. Jito is also one of the most profitable players in the crypto industry, making over $70 million in fees in May, up from $50 million in April. SPX6900 price surges as momentum continues Meanwhile, the SPX6900 token price surged to a high of $1.64, its highest level since January 20th. It has jumped by over 478% from its lowest point this year. SPX token jumped because of the ongoing meme coin rebound. It also rallied as smart money investors and whales continued accumulating the token, a sign that they expect it to keep rising.

The macro environment further supports this institutional thesis, with steady U.S. bond yields despite tariff-driven inflation concerns, expected Federal Reserve rate cuts , and a weakening U.S. dollar all contributing to favorable conditions for growth-oriented assets like Bitcoin. Corporate adoption has reached new heights with major firms like Metaplanet and Strategy holding Bitcoin in record numbers, while Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy continues its aggressive accumulation strategy . This institutional infrastructure has created what CNBC analysts describe as “strong fundamental, macro and technical backdrops” supporting continued price appreciation. Bitcoin Technical Analysis Points to Explosive Breakout CNBC’s technical analysis reveals Bitcoin’s successful navigation through a classic range-bound consolidation between $93,000 and $105,000, followed by a false breakdown in March that trapped short sellers before the subsequent explosive breakout above $107,000. The pattern CNBC analysts explain indicates intense institutional buying pressure. MattC, an Engineer analyst, perfectly describes this pattern, suggesting that Bitcoin has entered the “outer space” territory with minimal historical resistance levels. Bitcoin Outer Space Chart Source: MattC on X The curve is a long-term exponential trend line that Bitcoin has been following, suggesting the current rally is part of a larger macro bull cycle. The fact that Bitcoin has broken into this “outer space” region suggests the next major resistance levels could be psychological round numbers like $120,000 or $130,000. More so, the volatility analysis using Average Percent True Range (APTR) shows particularly intriguing behavior, with low volatility readings of 8.5% on weekly charts and 3-4% on daily charts typically preceding major breakouts. Unlike traditional markets where volatility decreases during uptrends, Bitcoin exhibits the opposite behavior, with increasing volatility accompanying price advances. This unique characteristic, combined with Bitcoin’s approach to the triple-resistance level of $110,000, has led CNBC analysts to project a 100% Fibonacci target of $135,000. Furthermore, historical cycle analysis reveals Bitcoin’s adherence to four-year halving patterns, with peaks traditionally occurring in June of halving years. The current 2025 cycle shows Bitcoin breaking previous all-time high resistance levels around $200,000, suggesting the early stages of what could be the most significant bull run in Bitcoin’s history.

Global liquidity continues to expand. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/BU2hCA6PmZ — Root (@therationalroot) June 9, 2025 Global liquidity analysis further supports this technical outlook. Bitcoin’s price strongly correlates with the expanding central bank money supply from major economies, currently showing positive growth of 5-10% year over year. In summary, Bitcoin appears positioned to transcend previous market cycles and establish a new ATH. Whether Bitcoin reaches Bernstein’s “conservative” $200,000 target or CNBC’s aggressive $135,000 projection, the convergence of these technical patterns already creates a foundation for Bitcoin’s continued increase.

2025-06-11T10:05:08,"Ethereum Makes a Big Attack: It Left Bitcoin Behind! – Analyst Gives Date for New ATH!","The largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), has upset its investors in recent years with its weak performance, but has made a big move in recent weeks. ETH, which has increased by approximately 5% in the last 24 hours, has approached $ 2,800. While Ethereum provided some relief to its investors with its rise, it also left Bitcoin behind. According to Coinglass data, the trading volume of Ethereum derivatives increased by 38% in 24 hours, reaching over $110 billion. Analysts said the increase was driven by continued strong inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs, renewed interest in DeFi, and positive news from the SEC. This data signals increasing institutional participation for Ethereum, with its $110 billion trading volume surpassing that of Bitcoin derivatives, which had $84.72 billion. While this increase in Ethereum derivatives trading volume comes along with the increase in ETH price, BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas said that ETH's transaction increase reflects structural growth and increasing institutional interest. “Ethereum's growth in transaction volume is not a momentary one; it reflects structural growth, institutional validation, and real utility, “ETH is no longer just the second largest crypto by market cap, it is becoming the cornerstone of the digital asset economy.” Lucas, who also explained his prediction about the Ethereum price, said that there is an increase on the horizon, but for now, the $ 2,800 support and $ 3,600 resistance are critical for the new ATH process. “In the short term, ETH is riding a bullish wave. Price action is bullish, but we are also eyeing key levels – resistance at $3,600, support around $2,800. “If staking-supported ETFs are approved later this year, that could push ETH into the $5,500-$6,700 range by December.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T10:00:50,"Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Price Retests $109,000, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Pullback","Bitcoin (BTC) is trying to reclaim a crucial area amid its recent price recovery, which could propel the flagship crypto toward new highs. Some analysts suggested that BTC is preparing for the “final resistance,” while others warned that it still risks a potential pullback to lower levels. Related Reading: Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 – Is A Recovery Around The Corner? Bitcoin Rally Eyes Next Resistance Bitcoin has finally regained significant bullish momentum after printing a massive daily candle on Monday. The flagship crypto recently lost its post-all-time high (ATH) range of $106,800-$109,700, sparking concern among some investors. Amid the recent market pullbacks, which began in late May, the flagship crypto also registered some volatility, losing key levels as support and hitting a one-month low near the $100,000 level last week. However, BTC reclaimed the $105,000 mark over the weekend before surging above the $106,800 crucial resistance on Monday. Following this performance, analyst Rekt Capital stated that Bitcoin has successfully retested the $104,400 re-accumulation range high resistance as new support for four weeks. He highlighted that BTC was “rebounding from this new support base in an effort to transition into Price Discovery again.” Additionally, Bitcoin ended its two-week downtrend, recording a Daily Close around the $110,500 area. Per the analyst, BTC “has skipped through the $106,600-$109,443 Daily Range entirely,” and is “once again positioning itself like in late May for a retest” of the range’s high as support, which propelled the price to its ATH last month. A daily close above the $109,443 level would set up BTC for a revisit of the “final Daily resistance,” around the $111,723 mark, before a new ATH. The analyst also affirmed that reclaiming the “final weekly resistance” of $108,900 as support would also add to BTC’s momentum. BTC In A ‘Dangerous Area’? Analyst Crypto Jelle suggested that turning the $108,000 price area into support could send Bitcoin to the price discovery phase, potentially targeting the $120,000 mark. He noted that previous unsuccessful breakout attempts failed to reclaim this level, but that the cryptocurrency is currently holding this area. Based on a multi-month pattern, Jelle also reaffirmed its $140,000-$150,000 target for BTC’s cycle top. The analyst highlighted a major inverted Head and Shoulders pattern forming since the end of 2024. According to the post, the pattern is “nearing completion” after the recent price drop formed the right shoulder, while the neckline sits around the $111,000 mark. A breakout above this level could send Bitcoin to Jelle’s cycle top target. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Altcoin Sherpa considers that BTC’s chart “looks pretty good” in the high-time timeframes, suggesting that he will be “bullish until shown otherwise.” However, he warned that Bitcoin is “still in a dangerous area” as it could drop to lower levels if it doesn’t reclaim the $110,000 level. To Sherpa, “it’s logical to assume some sort of pullback is going to come in the red supply zone,” which sits between the key resistance line and its ATH level. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez highlighted on X that BTC’s most important support area sits between the $102,770 and $106,090 levels, where 2.21 million addresses bought 1.39 million BTC. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $109,995, a 3.6% increase in the weekly timeframe.

2025-06-11T09:55:11,"Ukrainian lawmakers propose bill to let central bank hold Bitcoin","Lawmakers in Ukraine are currently reviewing the country’s first cryptocurrency reserve bill to allow the National Bank of Ukraine to hold Bitcoin and other crypto assets as part of its official reserves. On June 10, draft bill 13356 was submitted to Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. The bill, introduced by Member of Parliament Yaroslav Zhelezniak, amends an existing law, “On the National Bank of Ukraine,” to permit the inclusion of digital assets, such as Bitcoin, in state reserves alongside traditional assets, like gold and foreign currencies. However, it must be noted that the bill does not mandate the central bank to acquire crypto assets but grants it the authority to do so at its own discretion. Deatils of the bill According to Zhelezniak, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) would independently decide if, when, and how much of its reserves should be allocated to cryptocurrencies. Zhelezniak, who confirmed the proposal’s submission via his official Telegram channel, said the legislation is intended to bring Ukraine in line with global financial innovation trends and could help strengthen macroeconomic stability. According to him, proper management of crypto reserves could unlock new opportunities for Ukraine’s digital economy. The proposal follows earlier signals from Zhelezniak about plans to introduce a crypto reserve bill with support from industry stakeholders. While the lawmaker previously stated the initiative would focus solely on Bitcoin, the current draft broadens the scope to include other crypto assets as well, contradicting his earlier comments. Last month, Binance expressed support for Ukraine’s crypto reserve initiative. Regional head Kirill Khomyakov said the move could help fast-track regulatory clarity, provided it is accompanied by comprehensive digital asset legislation. If passed, the bill would make Ukraine the first European country to legally establish a state Bitcoin reserve. Other major central banks across Europe, like the Swiss National Bank, have so far rejected the idea of bitcoin as a reserve asset. Ukraine joins a list of jurisdictions, including Russia, El Salvador, Japan, Brazil, Pakistan, and the US, alongside states like Texas , Arizona, and New Hampshire , that have taken steps toward building crypto reserve strategies. Ukraine moves to regulate crypto Ukraine’s growing interest in a Bitcoin reserve also comes against the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions. Both Russia and Ukraine have turned to cryptocurrencies in recent years, with digital assets playing a role in cross-border donations, fundraising, and capital movement during conflict-related disruptions. Ukraine has been actively working to reshape its digital asset regulations in recent months. In April, a draft law on virtual assets secured unanimous approval from the Verkhovna Rada’s Finance, Tax and Customs Policy Committee. However, the legislation was subsequently pulled from the agenda, reportedly at the request of the President’s Office. Despite this, the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission has moved forward with proposals to tax crypto gains. In a recent consultation paper, the regulator recommended a 23% tax on individual crypto income, comprising an 18% personal income tax and a 5% military levy. The commission has also advocated for simplified tax reporting systems and digital tools to help users comply with obligations, especially as many individuals may be unaware of their tax liabilities from crypto activity.

2025-06-11T09:40:00,"BTC and SOL bulls are eyeing MUTM as their next high-upside play","Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) have long held the spotlight in the crypto market, drawing in millions of investors with their impressive bull runs. But today, the narrative is shifting. With BTC’s growth now focused on preservation rather than multiplication and SOL showing signs of consolidation after a rapid climb, large crypto holders are actively looking for new, high-upside opportunities. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the picture—offering a compelling mix of early-phase pricing, real decentralized finance (DeFi) utility, and a roadmap already in motion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale, is building a non-custodial DeFi protocol that combines both peer-to-peer (P2P) and pool-to-contract (P2C) lending. Backed by an 80.00 CertiK audit and a beta platform on the verge of rollout, the project is gaining attention from smart investors who understand that the real returns now lie in undervalued, low-market-cap projects with strong fundamentals. The case for reallocation: stability vs growth Bitcoin (BTC) is widely accepted as a digital store of value, while Solana (SOL) has positioned itself as a high-speed blockchain platform for decentralized apps. Yet, both assets are now seen as relatively mature. Their upside is slower and less dramatic compared to what early-stage projects can offer. Investors with large positions in BTC and SOL are reallocating a portion of their portfolios into emerging protocols that offer not just upside, but also real, working income models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) answers that call by delivering on-chain lending without the middleman, flexible income options, and access to both blue-chip tokens and volatile meme coins like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB—all within one DeFi platform. It’s this kind of utility that high-cap holders are now favoring as they seek growth beyond price speculation. Unlike BTC or SOL, which are already in circulation and tied to market cycles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a transparent and ascending presale model. The token is currently priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 and will gradually rise through eleven total phases until reaching $0.06 by the final presale phase—doubling from its current value before exchange listing. That structured increase means early participants are set to lock in up to 2x returns even before the token goes live. For example, an investor who secured $2,000 worth of MUTM at the current price of $0.03 will watch that value grow into $4,000 when the token hits $0.06 at the end of the presale. Over $10.25 million has already been raised, and more than 11,850 holders have joined the ecosystem—clearly signaling growing interest and momentum before the token even hits exchanges. Real utility from day one: lending for Both P2P and P2C What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from typical presale projects is its functional ecosystem. The protocol allows users to lend and borrow across both peer-to-peer (P2P) and pool-to-contract (P2C) models. Lenders earn returns while borrowers gain liquidity without needing to exit their positions. Unlike speculative tokens, Mutuum enables actual use cases. Lenders are not just parking tokens—they’re contributing to a liquidity engine that supports a wide range of asset-backed loans. The P2P model allows users to lend directly to other users for tokens that often go unsupported on traditional platforms, including meme coins and other high-volatility assets. Meanwhile, the P2C system provides a more automated, liquidity-pool-based primary solution for stable tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emphasizes freedom and control. There are no deposit caps, and the platform is fully non-custodial, meaning users retain full ownership of their assets at all times. This is crucial for institutional and high-net-worth investors who require transparent on-chain execution and complete asset custody. Rather than creating artificial restrictions or custodial risk, Mutuum is structured to attract serious DeFi participants looking to earn passively on their capital in a secure and scalable system. Secure passive income via buybacks and staking The platform’s long-term value is reinforced through staking rewards funded by protocol-generated revenue buybacks. Users who stake their mtTokens—which represent deposits in Mutuum’s liquidity pools—become eligible for passive dividends. These dividends are distributed whenever the protocol uses a portion of its revenue to buy MUTM tokens on the open market and send them to safety module participants. This creates a sustainable income loop that rewards long-term participation. The model appeals to long-term crypto holders—such as those from BTC or SOL ecosystems—who now seek yield-generating strategies without needing to sell or trade actively. Security is non-negotiable for large investors, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already passed a complete CertiK audit, receiving a respectable score of 80.00. This indicates strong contract security and trustworthiness—qualities often missing in early-stage DeFi projects. Adding to that, the beta launch of the Mutuum platform is just around the corner. This means that investors will not have to wait months or years to see a working product for testing. Looking ahead, besides the ongoing $100K giveaway , Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already announced plans for Layer-2 integration, aimed at reducing gas fees and improving scalability across the protocol. In addition, a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin is in development, intended to support internal lending and repayments with maximum on-chain transparency. Both features are major steps toward long-term sustainability and signal the team’s commitment to creating an expansive ecosystem—not just a one-feature platform. Why high-cap crypto holders are joining early The combination of transparent tokenomics, actual platform utility, passive income mechanics, and a presale structure designed for 2x returns is too strong to ignore. Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) holders are entering Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because it offers the best of both worlds: long-term stability through staking and income, and short-term upside through strategic early entry. With $0.03 entry pricing still live and platform milestones already being achieved, Mutuum is in the sweet spot where opportunity meets execution. The upside is real, and the timeline is short.

Source: Hypurrscan.io Bitcoin bulls target $150,000 after breaking key resistance The whale’s aggressive positioning comes as Bitcoin surged past the $110,000 mark, with analysts suggesting the next potential target could be $150,000 if technical indicators continue to align. Prominent crypto analyst TradingShot observed that Bitcoin’s current rally has invalidated several short-term bearish patterns and broken through a critical resistance zone. The analyst noted that Bitcoin recently rebounded at the lower high trendline of a three-year ascending channel, with this price structure appearing thrice in Bitcoin’s ongoing ‘channel up’ formation. Each instance triggered at least a 101% gain. From the April 7 bottom, a 101% rally would put Bitcoin at the $150,000 mark, a clean technical target supported by historical precedent, strong channel support, and renewed breakout momentum . Analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicted that the current phase is likely a short consolidation period before increased upward momentum. Van de Poppe suggests the ideal buying range sits around $107,000 to $108,000 as BTC prepares for what could be another historic run. If Bitcoin’s relative strength index ( RSI ) retests 75 by the end of the month, analyst PlanB suggests the June closing price for BTC would be around $130,000. Meanwhile, investment firm Bernstein maintains a $200,000 price target, calling it a “high-conviction but conservative” forecast. Institutional demand remains strong, with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) (NASDAQ: MSTR ) buying over 1000 BTC this week, worth approximately $110.2 million in total.

2025-06-11T09:35:18,"BTC: The Most Cost-Effective Way To Buy Bitcoin","Summary Bitcoin has been the primary beneficiary of investment capital in the Digital Asset space since the approval of spot ETFs in early 2024. June is showing a potential change in sentiment, with negative net flow through June 7th. With Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust being a notable exception, most US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs have negative BTC-denominated AUM growth year to date. BTC remains a cost-effective way to get exposure to an anti-fiat debasement trade in 2025. Through the first week of June, Digital Asset investment net flows came in at $224 million. While this was the seventh consecutive week of positive net flow in the asset class, the week ended June 7th saw the weakest inflow story in nearly two months. Furthermore, if you take out iShares ETF products, year to date net flow into Digital Assets is actually negative. In this article, covering the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF ( BTC ), we'll look at capital flow trends in the Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) ETF products, issuer flows, as well as broader considerations for investors interested in Bitcoin. Capital Flow Winners and Losers There is no doubt at this point that Bitcoin has been the primary beneficiary of investment capital in the Digital Asset space since the approval of spot ETFs in early-2024. That outperformance continued through the first 5 months of 2025 with Bitcoin accounting for roughly 90% of year to date net flow and 86% of the Digital Asset financial product AUM: Asset (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin -$57 $10,143 $151,223 Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) $296 $1,701 $14,092 Multi-asset -$5.9 -$142 $6,763 Solana ( SOL-USD ) -$1.1 $79 $1,403 XRP ( XRP-USD ) -$4.0 $194 $1,216 Total $225 $11,342 $175,869 Source: CoinShares, as of June, 7th 2025 However, June is showing a potential change in sentiment, with many of the high-fliers from the last 12–18 months showing negative net flow through June 7th. This is happening while Ethereum - a hugely disappointing laggard post-ETF approvals - masked what would have been a week of negative net outflow were it not for inflow of just under $300 million through the first seven days of the month. Admittedly, this is just one week of data in a longer-term story. But it's interesting to me, nonetheless. The provider details are also quite telling because one product issuer is essentially the entire market so far this year and in June as well: Provider (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM iShares $330 $12,732 $72,844 Grayscale -$16 -$1,741 $29,339 Fidelity -$168 -$274 $20,511 ARK 21 Shrs -$25 -$47 $4,789 Bitwise -$13 -$273 $4,219 Total $225 $11,342 $175,869 Source: CoinShares, as of June, 7th 2025 Were it not for the $330 million month to date net flows into iShares products, investment in Digital Asset ETFs would have been negative through the first week of June. Unlike the asset breakout, this is not a new trend. The year to date story is quite similar with $12.7 billion in positive net flows year to date while most of the other major asset managers have actually seen outflow. This is indeed the case for Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise. This would seemingly indicate that it is the asset class itself, rather than a simple 'fee flight' migration from Grayscale products.

If it was just a 'fee flight' story, I would think Grayscale's Mini Trust would be a bigger beneficiary of asset flow than IBIT: Fund Comparison Inception Expense Ratio AUM IBIT 01/05/2024 0.25% $71.85 ARKB 01/10/2024 0.21% $4.97 FBTC 01/10/2024 0.25% $20.49 BITB 01/10/2024 0.20% $4.10 GBTC 09/25/2013 1.50% $20.13 BTC 07/31/2024 0.15% $4.73 Source: Seeking Alpha, June 10th 2025, AUM in billions While still far more competitive than the 1.5% expense ratio seen through GBTC, IBIT is more expensive than Grayscale's Mini Trust and two additional offerings with top 5 AUM. Grayscale's Mini Trust is the most cost-effective, with just a .15% expense ratio. Data by YCharts If we look at the total return of both IBIT and BTC since the inception of the latter at the end of July 2024, we do indeed see BTC gets a very slight edge in total return. For a 'set it and forget it' type of investor, BTC will ultimately outperform IBIT since it's 10 bps cheaper annually. That said, this is not necessarily a meaningful boost in return for an asset that has appreciated in value by over 66% in the last 11 months. For those who want liquidity, IBIT is the clear winner. But for longer-term Bitcoin bulls, BTC will work perfectly fine. Cycle Top and Global Liquidity In previous articles for Seeking Alpha covering Bitcoin and cyclical sell indicators, we've looked at metrics like MVRV and Pi Cycle Top. From where I sit, the fundamental argument for Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment network isn't all that compelling, given the lackluster growth in usage and scaling. However, the belief by many that Bitcoin is 'Digital Gold' continues to carry the asset as an 'anti-fiat currency' instrument. As I see it, that view is still a winning one until price returns stop moving with global M2: BTC vs M2 (BGeometrics) I still like this chart quite a bit, and it shows Bitcoin price appreciation could realistically be looked at as a liquidity sponge when global M2 starts to surge on a year-over-year basis. Isolating down to the last 12 months shows Bitcoin's price moving with a lag when global M2 growth hits 7% year over year: BTC vs M2, 1 yr (BGeometrics) Our first example shows M2 growth at 7% in late September 2024. This preceded a 67% rip higher in BTC from $63k to $105k in December. We again saw 7% YoY growth in global M2 at the end of April. Bitcoin's return since then is slightly above 11%. Notably, M2 growth does not appear to be slowing down just yet, with the YoY change again hitting 7.5% as of June 2nd. Should history repeat, we could reasonably expect a Bitcoin price closer to $158k later this summer. Risks The old adage fits here; past performance is not a forecast of future returns. Just because money printing by global governments/central banks has produced higher Bitcoin prices so far, it doesn't necessarily mean that dynamic will continue. Bitcoin was initially intended to be a monetary asset for the people to use on-chain and with each other. 'HODLing' via ETFs isn't exactly what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. Furthermore, Bitcoin remains a new asset relative to historical fiat currency substitutes: Bitcoin/Gold Ratio ( Longtermtrends ) Measured against Gold, Bitcoin hasn't gone anywhere since November 2021. I will reiterate what I've said since I first started covering Bitcoin for Seeking Alpha several years ago; those seeking refuge from fiat currency debasement don't need to pick between the two when they can just buy both Bitcoin and Gold. Closing Summary I remain long Bitcoin both directly and through the ETF wrapper. While I personally like FBTC for my long-term position, I think Grayscale's Mini Trust is a perfectly fine way to allocate to Bitcoin in a traditional investment account. BTC is the most cost-effective way to buy that exposure, and I believe the fact that BTC is the only major spot ETF that has seen positive year to date inflows is a testament to that cost-effectiveness.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793978-btc-the-most-cost-effective-way-to-buy-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|TRADING","BTC-USD|BTC",cryptocompare

2025-06-11T04:32:43,"ETH Technical Analysis as ETH Futures Conquers $2800","<p>Ethereum (ETH) Futures: Comprehensive Analysis & Institutional Bullish Signals</p><p>The past weeks have seen Ethereum (ETH) futures steadily gaining momentum, marked by increasing trading volumes and institutional inflows. The evolving landscape of Ethereum ETFs further supports a bullish short-term narrative, driving increased optimism among crypto traders and investors. This article provides a detailed technical and fundamental overview of ETH futures, enriched by institutional data and a strategic technical analysis.</p><p>Technical Analysis Video Transcript:</p><p>I present the bigger picture of where ETH futures is at, and the next targets above the current price, that I am looking at, in this ETH futures technical analysis video.</p><p>We notice an important purple channel shown in the video. I expect Ether to cross upward again, creating another touchpoint on the red resistance and breaking out above.</p><p>From the volume profile analysis and other methodologies from tradeCompass at ForexLive.com and investingLive.com, the next key price targets I anticipate are $2,882, and possibly - $2,920, and $2,967. Reaching the second target (around 2,920) implies another approximate 4% move, offering an attractive opportunity for day traders and short-term swing traders.</p><p>However, we might see a scenario where Ether revisits either the upper boundary of the purple channel or even retests the red line around 2,825. These specific figures require referencing additional charts, but the current orientation shows bulls firmly maintaining control. Personally, I would not choose to short here, expecting a decline.</p><p>Sophisticated traders are likely to take profits into liquidity spikes, with a minimum upside target near $2,880.</p><p>Please trade ETH and other crypto assets at your own risk only. This is not financial advice. </p><p>Importantly, if we observe two consecutive bearish daily candles, each clearly closing below the aforementioned resistance, this would challenge the current bullish bias and could hand control back to bears. Lastly, beware of fake-outs on lower timeframes.</p><p>Institutional Support and ETF Inflows:</p><p>Recent institutional data strongly underpins Ethereum’s bullish outlook. Notably, on June 10, Ethereum Spot ETFs witnessed a significant net inflow of $125 million, prominently driven by major asset managers:</p><ul><li><p>Blackrock: $80.60M</p></li><li><p>Fidelity: $26.30M</p></li><li><p>Bitwise: $8.40M</p></li><li><p>Grayscale: $9.70M</p></li></ul><p>This robust institutional participation highlights strategic accumulation and bullish sentiment among major players, indicating that smart money continues to favor Ethereum.</p><p>Volume Shift ETH vs. BTC:</p><p>A critical volume shift further cements ETH’s bullish momentum. Ethereum's trading volume increased dramatically by approximately $29.60 billion within a 24-hour timeframe, contrasting starkly with Bitcoin’s volume drop of $28.31 billion. This divergence demonstrates a clear investor shift, possibly indicating a rotation away from Bitcoin toward Ethereum, potentially driven by fundamental developments or favorable sentiment towards ETH’s utility and upcoming network improvements.</p><p>ETH Futures Market Data:</p><ul><li><p>Current ETH Futures Price: $2,806.5</p></li><li><p>Daily Range: $2,785.0 - $2,845.5</p></li><li><p>52-week Range: $1,387.0 - $4,142.5</p></li><li><p>Volume & Open Interest:</p><ul><li><p>Volume: 1.63K contracts (moderate liquidity)</p></li><li><p>Open Interest: 15.47K contracts (significant institutional presence)</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Performance indicators remain strong:</p><ul><li><p>Weekly (1W): +6.95%</p></li><li><p>Monthly (1M): +10.66%</p></li><li><p>Quarterly (3M): +46.84%</p></li></ul><p>These indicators highlight a robust short-term recovery and bullish momentum in Ethereum futures.</p><p>ETH Futures Forward Curve Analysis:</p><p>The futures forward curve projects steadily increasing Ethereum prices into mid-2026, aligning with heightened institutional interest and bullish long-term outlook. This trajectory underscores market confidence in Ethereum’s ongoing developments and strategic positioning in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Conclusion and Key Takeaways for Ethereum traders:</p><ul><li><p>Ethereum futures exhibit significant bullish short-term momentum.</p></li><li><p>Institutional ETF inflows confirm robust investor confidence.</p></li><li><p>Dramatic positive volume shift highlights market rotation favoring Ethereum.</p></li><li><p>Critical technical resistance points at $2,882, $2,920, and $2,967 should guide short-term trading strategies.</p></li></ul><p>Risk Disclaimer:
