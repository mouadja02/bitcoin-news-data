2025-06-10T23:30:23,"Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level –  Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance","Ethereum is showing renewed strength after climbing above the $2,600 mark with ease, holding firmly above key support levels as bulls attempt to reclaim momentum. The move comes after weeks of range-bound price action, and while the breakout attempt has gained attention, traders are now watching closely for confirmation through a decisive push above the next resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? So far, ETH has held up well despite broader market volatility. With buyers back in control, the focus has shifted to whether Ethereum can break through the upper boundary of its current range and begin a sustained move higher. Without follow-through, price risks slipping back into consolidation, frustrating bullish positioning. Top analyst Big Cheds recently shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is now pushing into weekly range highs, specifically a zone defined by a cluster of upper shadows and the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA). This region has repeatedly acted as resistance, rejecting previous rally attempts. Ethereum Bulls Eye Breakout Confirmation Ethereum is at a critical juncture as bulls push price toward the $2,800 resistance — a level that must be decisively cleared to confirm a breakout and transition into a full bullish phase. After a sharp rebound from April’s low, where ETH traded near $1,400, the asset has surged more than 90%, reclaiming key moving averages and breaking through previous short-term resistance levels. Momentum is clearly building, but Ethereum now faces its most important test. The $2,800 zone marks the top of the current range and coincides with multiple technical barriers. Cheds highlighted that ETH is now trading into weekly range highs, where a cluster of upper shadows has repeatedly rejected price. This region also aligns with the underside of the 200-day moving average (DMA), reinforcing it as a major zone of resistance. According to Cheds, the bear thesis fails if ETH can flip $2,750 into support — a level that would likely signal trend reversal and sustained upside. However, macro risks remain. US Treasury yields continue to climb, reflecting concerns over inflation and tighter financial conditions. Rising yields often put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by pulling liquidity out of speculative markets. Despite these headwinds, Ethereum’s structure remains strong. As long as bulls maintain pressure and defend higher lows, the path toward reclaiming $3,000 becomes more probable. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger increased participation, both from technical traders and investors sidelined by recent volatility. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but the momentum is clearly shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June ETH Reaches Key Resistance Zone After Breakout Ethereum is currently trading at $2,688 on the 4-hour chart, after a strong breakout from a multi-day ascending triangle structure. The move was backed by rising volume and a clean reclaim of all major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($2,558), 100 SMA ($2,571), and 200 SMA ($2,535) — which now act as support beneath price. ETH has pushed directly into a key resistance zone between $2,690 and $2,735, highlighted by several previous rejection wicks. This area has acted as a supply zone since mid-May, capping every breakout attempt and leading to swift pullbacks. The current test marks Ethereum’s fifth attempt to break above this level in recent weeks, which increases the odds of a potential breakout, especially if bulls maintain momentum and volume remains elevated. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? However, if ETH fails to clear this zone, a pullback toward the 200 SMA or the $2,600 level is likely, especially if volume tapers off. The structure remains bullish in the short term, with higher lows forming and buying pressure increasing. A confirmed 4H close above $2,735 would signal breakout confirmation and likely trigger a push toward $2,900–$3,000. Until then, ETH remains rangebound — but bulls are clearly pressing on the door.

2025-06-10T23:30:00,"Russia Set to Fine, Confiscate Coins from Illegal Crypto Miners","Illegal crypto miners operating in Russia could lose their coins and face heavy fines under new rules formulated by the nation’s Ministry of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media. Per a report from Forbes Russia , the ministry says its proposal is currently undergoing interdepartmental review. However, if the plans are adopted as-is, Russian law agencies and courts will be given the power to seize crypto from illegal miners. Russia: Miners May Be Fined for Flaunting Bans Under the new proposal, Russian judges will also be able to punish individuals engaging in illegal mining. Courts will be able to hand out fines worth between 100,000 to 200,000 rubles ($1,272 to $2,544). Maksut Shadayev, the Russian Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media, speaking at the Federation Council earlier this year. (Source: Federation Council/VK/Screenshot) Forbes Russia says it has seen the ministry’s proposal. It says Moscow also wants to fine and confiscate crypto from any individual found illegally participating in a mining pool. Harsher fines still lie in store for solo entrepreneurs and officials. This group will have to pay between 200,000 and 400,000 rubles ($2,544 to $5088) if convicted. Authorities will also gain the power to take coins from industrial miners who flaunt crypto mining rules. The new rules will let courts impose a fine of 1 million ($12,728) to 2 million rubles ($25,456) on corporations involved in illegal mining. The ministry wants to amend the country’s Code of Administrative Offenses, seeking to effectively make illegal mining a criminal offense. BTC hashrate distribution amongst the largest known mining pools over the past four days. (Source: Blockchain.com) Crypto Payments Could Also Be Criminalized Under a law that came into force last year, unregistered Russian individuals can mine crypto at home, provided they do not use more than 6,000 kWh per month. However, in some 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions, mining restrictions apply. The law also states that people with unexpunged convictions for economic crimes, or those convicted of extremist or terrorist crimes, cannot mine crypto. The law also bans certain electricity and grid management firms from mining crypto. Additionally, the ministry plans to punish individuals and firms for making settlements in crypto in Russia outside the Central Bank-run crypto sandbox. The ministry’s proposals include plans to fine people and firms who use crypto as a payment tool up to 1 million rubles ($12,728). The Central Bank, however, appears to think that the threat of confiscating coins from people who seek to do business in crypto will be a bigger deterrent. Andrey Medvedev, the bank’s Legal Department lead, told attendees at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum last month: “The key thing is that the [crypto] illegally used as a means of payment will be confiscated. And this will be the most painful thing.” Russia and China say the Pentagon's proposed missile-defense shield will be destabilizing.

A government energy commission, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, ruled against a proposal to ban mining in Khakassia. The commission also decided to postpone a proposed year-round ban on mining in the Zabaikalsky Krai and Buryatia regions.

2025-06-10T22:04:18,"Trump's CFTC Pick Says U.S. Can Boost Crypto Innovation and Shield Consumers","President Donald Trump's pick to be chairman of the U.S. commodities watchdog, Brian Quintenz, fielded crypto questions more than any other topic at his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, and he assured the lawmakers that the agency can walk a middle ground between unhampered innovation and robust consumer safeguards. Even as Quintenz awaits the Senate Agriculture Committee's vote on whether to advance his nomination as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Congress is working on market structure legislation that could elevate that agency as the marquee regulator of U.S. crypto activity. Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner, is no stranger to that sector, having served as venture capital firm a16z's head of policy. ""I have always viewed market structure legislation as an opportunity to be both pro-customer protection and pro-innovation at the same time,"" he told the senators weighing his nomination, which ultimately needs to be approved by the overall Senate before he can take over the commission. He said the bill could ""provide the clarity to buildings, entrepreneurs, innovators to develop products"" while also ensuring the regulated firms are appropriately protecting the users of those products. ""Congress should create an appropriate market regulatory regime to ensure that this technology’s full promise can be realized, and I am fully prepared to use my experience and expertise to assist in that effort as well in executing any expanded mission should legislation pass into law,"" Quintenz said, adding that he's willing to work under the CFTC's current powers ""to provide clarity of how the agency’s statutory objectives could be successfully leveraged through this technology."" Quintenz would join a commission that's being abandoned by commissioners . By statute, the CFTC has five members — with three from the party in power — but the members have left or are in the process of leaving, including Acting Chairman Caroline Pham, who said she's leaving when Quintenz starts work. The lone Democrat, Kristen Johnson, said she'll depart ""later this year,"" leaving some uncertainty about her timing. So Quintenz may serve opposite a single Democrat before eventually working alone for a time, leaving potential legal vulnerability for any unilateral policies. Some of the Democratic senators noted the Trump administration has been systematically stripping regulatory commissions of their Democratic members — described by Senator Raphael Warnock as ""political purges"" — and asked Quintenz if he would encourage the White House to fill both sides of the roster. ""The president is the head of the executive, and the president will make his own decisions. Quintenz said. He later added, ""I don't tell the president what to do."" He granted that the agency may need more funding if it's assigned the monumental new task as the regulator of digital commodities spot markets, which would include transactions of bitcoin BTC. Quintenz said that new staff would be made more efficient by ""a technology-first approach"" that makes the employees more efficient. Quintenz also fielded a number of questions on the prediction markets, another area he's had direct experience with as a board member of Kalshi, which fought a legal battle with the CFTC over the regulation of event contracts. He defended such event contracts as an appropriate ""hedging tool."" ""I believe the Commodity Exchange Act is very clear about the purpose of derivatives markets, the purpose of risk management and price discovery, and that events [contracts] can serve a function in that mandate,"" he said.

In a new press release, the DOJ says the international crime ring operated by misleading victims to invest in false digital asset scams. The DOJ says Joseph Wong, Yicheng Zhang, Jose Somarriba, Shengsheng He and Jingliang Su were part of an international criminal network that tricked American victims into believing they were investing in digital assets, but instead funneled money through US shell companies, international bank accounts and crypto wallets. Through texts, phone calls, social media and dating apps, the perpetrators contacted victims and gained their trust. They would then convince victims to invest in fraudulent crypto projects, telling the victims all the while that their investments were increasing in value. Instead of investing their capital, however, the men transferred $36.9 million in victim funds to a single account at Deltec Bank in the Bahamas under the name of “Axis Digital Limited.” The funds were then funneled to USDT wallets controlled by individuals in Cambodia. Aside from the five men pleading guilty, eight other co-conspirators have also confessed, so far.

2025-06-10T22:00:41,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Supply Dynamics Shift As Net Position Change Turns Negative","After a remarkable bullish performance on Monday, Bitcoin , the largest digital asset, has taken the spotlight as it surges towards its current all-time high, achieved in May. Despite BTC’s notable upward movement in the past few days, short-term investors are exhibiting a weakening sentiment toward the flagship asset. A Bearish Behavior From Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Given the renewed market uptrend, Bitcoin has regained a positive trend and surged back above key resistance levels like the $109,000 price level. During this period, Darkfost, an on-chain expert and verified author, outlined a waning activity from short-term BTC holders or retail investors. According to the on-chain expert, it appears that the most recent BTC drop, in which the flagship asset fell below the $80,000 mark, severely unsettled short-term holders. This worrying behavior among these investors is observed in a shift in the STH Net Position Change metric into negative territory. The shift in STH’s net position into a bearish zone reflects an increasing wave of selling pressure from younger investors, in contrast to the tenacity of the long-term holder cohort. Short-term holders’ activity often influences BTC’s performance in the near term; this significant move might portend trouble ahead for the digital asset. Darkfost revealed in the X post that the net position change among short-term holders has sustained a bearish trend over the past month. Looking at the chart, this trend has been in negative territory even though Bitcoin’s price has remained strong above the $100,000 mark. Data from the author shows that the metric is drawing closer to levels comparable to those observed during the previous correction after a total of -833,000 BTC were shifted. Since the change, it seems short-term holders have become considerably more sensitive to changes in the market. As for the recent drop in BTC’s price around the $100,000 level , Darkfost stated it was sufficient to cause fresh anxiety among this group of investors. Considering the trend, the expert claims it is imperative to keep a tight eye on these holders’ behavior in the near future to gauge BTC’s potential next trajectory. Fading Retail Holders Buying Pressure Bitcoin may have rallied strongly, but short-term holders have been responding negatively to the uptrend with a persistent sell-off. On-chain analyst Boris revealed that while these investors offload their coins, long-term holders or seasoned investors are accumulating, indicating a potential inflection in Bitcoin’s structure. For 30 days, retail addresses have viewed BTC’s renewed price increase as a chance to sell. Within the 30 days of consistent distribution by this group, one day in particular stands out the most with over 592,000 BTC in net outflows. Such actions convey a general anticipation of lower price movement as well as pessimism toward the surge. Given that short-term holders are selling and long-term holders are buying, this implies that the ongoing rally is not just speculative, but structurally supported by strong hands.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sths-supply-dynamics-shift/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Boris|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTC STH Net Position Change Metric|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Darkfost|Long-Term Bitcoin Holders|Short-term Bitcoin Holders",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T22:00:38,"Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises","As Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) rises in the crypto market, analysts are closely watching for signs of the long-awaited altcoin season. In a recent analysis, a crypto market expert shared key insights on the best time to buy altcoins, offering strategic guidance for traders looking to position themselves ahead of the next potential market rally. When To Position For The Altcoin Season As the Bitcoin price continues its upward trajectory, the speculation about an impending altcoin season remains a recurring theme across crypto communities. However, a Bitcoin Dominance chart shared by ‘Stockmoney Lizards,’ a pseudonymous crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), challenges the narrative that an altcoin season is imminent. Related Reading: The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62% Drawing on personal experience and market cycles, Stockmoney Lizards explains that the repeated cries of “altcoin season is here” are often premature and misleading. The analyst revealed that the true altcoin season, the period where even the lowest-quality coins tend to skyrocket, is often the final phase of the crypto bull run. It begins when Bitcoin Dominance breaks below the 60% support level, signaling a market-wide shift into altcoins. Notably, the analyst has shed light on how and when to position ahead of the altcoin season. Instead of buying altcoins based on hype or assumptions of immediate gains, Stockmoney Lizards suggests a more disciplined strategy: accumulate only at extreme oversold levels. This is typically when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour or daily time frame drops below 25-30, reflecting capitulation. According to the market expert, these moments offer the best entry points for short-term rebounds, where altcoins deliver explosive moves of about 50% to 200%. The analyst further highlights that the primary objective is to take profits and rotate them back into Bitcoin. This approach not only maximizes gains but also minimizes exposure to prolonged drawdowns that usually follow the euphoric phase of the market cycle. Bitcoin Dominance Influence On AltSeason According to Stockmoney Lizards, the current behaviour of BTC.D, trading firmly between a well-defined channel, indicates that the market is still in the early to mid-phase of a bull run. Typically, this phase is dominated by Bitcoin, not altcoins, and history shows that institutional capital prefers to build positions in the flagship cryptocurrency before moving to riskier lower-cap assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $200,000 And Ethereum At $10,000? Analyst Says Altcoin Season Is Coming Notably, Bitcoin’s rising dominance in the market is not seen by the analyst as a bearish signal for altcoins in the long term. Instead, it is perceived as a healthy sign of a maturing bull market. He disclosed that the real altcoin season doesn’t begin until BTC.D decisively breaks down from its channel and drops to historical lows. Until then, Bitcoin’s strength reflects institutional accumulation and market confidence. Stockmoney Lizards reveals that retail investors often misinterpret this as a signal to chase altcoins, only to be caught holding bags as BTC continues to outperform. The analyst concludes that the altcoin season breakout will eventually come, but only those who position smartly by letting Bitcoin lead and waiting for alts to reach oversold extremes will be best prepared to capitalize on the market rally.

Here’s What Analysts Say","The Bitcoin price has bounced back to $110,000, with experts warning this could be a bull trap.

After the brief dip, the Bitcoin price retraced slightly, landing just above the key Fibonacci 0.618 support level, signaling strong bullish momentum. However, skepticism lingers over whether the upward move has staying power or if it could evolve into a classic bull trap. Momentum Builds For FloppyPepe (FPPE) As AI-Driven Presale Reaches Fresh Highs FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents a unique opportunity with an early advantage that’s hard to overlook. The project is currently undergoing beta testing, and a carefully planned rollout featuring a zero-tax presale is in progress, offering tokens at a price of just $0.00000035 . This opens up significant growth possibilities for investors, as the project aims to thrive by being listed on prominent centralized exchanges. It uses influencer marketing across platforms such as X, Instagram, and TikTok to garner viral attention. Merging AI Functionality With Community Participation FloppyPepe (FPPE) is creating a smart, AI-driven ecosystem with practical applications. Its roadmap includes various advanced tools, such as FloppyAI , an upcoming chatbot offering guidance in academics and careers. Additionally, there’s FloppyX , a system for user-generated video content that uses dynamic content generation, and a Meme-o-matic AI agent for creating memes. This AI-focused approach is designed for a tech-savvy audience seeking both entertainment and practicality, setting FloppyPepe (FPPE) apart from other meme coins. Moreover, SolidProof has conducted a successful audit of the project’s smart contract. Floppynomics: Encouraging Participation While Supporting Real-World Causes FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) transaction structure incorporates a 3% fee on all trades, designed to benefit both the ecosystem and the global community. A portion of this fee goes towards wildlife conservation, another segment is redistributed as rewards to holders, all within a massive supply of 120 trillion tokens. The initiative will sponsor efforts to conserve endangered species, such as hippos, and aid in habitat restoration. Furthermore, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) project aims to collaborate with local organizations to make sure that its contributions have the most significant impact in key areas. Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Might Be The Only 1000x Meme Coin Left To Buy In 2025 Given the presale price of $0.00000035 , the potential upside associated with FloppyPepe (FPPE) is vast, especially compared to the slow growth of many other meme tokens. Only 20% of the total tokens are available in the presale, while 60% of the circulating supply is earmarked for early distribution. If the post-listing expectations are realized and the token reaches $0.01, this could theoretically result in a return of up to one thousand percent, turning a $50 investment into $50,000. This offers a significantly larger profit potential than most altcoins can provide. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Don’t Miss This Investment Window While investors’ fears of a bull trap grow, FloppyPepe (FPPE), on the other hand, is gaining incredible momentum in its presale stage. Analysts suggest that tokens in early phases with unique utility and a token’s low market cap are often seen as a strong signal for possible triple-digit returns. Remarkably, the first stage of FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale sold out within weeks, raising over $2 million. The presale price, fixed at just $0.00000035, presents a final opportunity to invest at such a low entry point. Seize this potentially life-changing chance now.

2025-06-10T21:45:00,"Is This the Perfect Time for Altcoins? Expert Predictions on the Next Crypto Move","Altcoins set for growth as BTC nears all-time highs, signaling volatility and rally potential. Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink are leading altcoins poised for significant growth. Meme coins like Pepe and Dogecoin are attracting retail interest but require cautious trading. The cryptocurrency markets are now at a major stage, with altcoins preparing for significant growth. As Bitcoin (BTC) nears its all-time high, altcoins are expected to experience increased volatility, with smaller pullbacks and larger upward movements. This movement follows the departure of many investors from their positions, potentially setting the stage for a strong altcoin rally. In a YouTube video on Tuesday, Crypto Banter announced that the overall market condition is transforming.

2025-06-10T21:00:19,"Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level – No Clear Breakout Yet","Ethereum is making waves in the crypto market, pushing into key resistance levels following an impressive 14% surge over the past few days. This upward momentum has put bulls firmly in control, igniting optimism among investors as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap tests critical thresholds. The recent rally has brought Ethereum close to a pivotal juncture, where breaking through higher levels could confirm sustained bullish momentum and potentially signal the start of a broader uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? Top analyst Daan recently shared an insightful analysis, highlighting that Ethereum remains rangebound between approximately $2,475 and $2,735. This consolidation zone has proven to be a battleground, with the price repeatedly testing its boundaries. Notably, Ethereum has now retested the range high of $2,735 for the fourth time, a level that has acted as both support and resistance in recent weeks. The price has also swept both the highs and lows within this range, suggesting a period of indecision that could precede a significant move. For bulls to maintain their dominance, clearing this resistance will be crucial. Failure to do so might invite renewed selling pressure, keeping the market on edge as traders watch for the next catalyst. Ethereum Clears Range Highs But Needs Confirmation Ethereum stands at a decisive level following a robust push into resistance, marking a critical moment for the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. After a notable surge, the price has tested key thresholds, drawing sharp attention from market participants. Sentiment remains deeply divided, with some analysts anticipating a breakout to higher prices, fueled by the recent momentum, while others predict an imminent correction as overextension risks loom. This uncertainty is compounded by global tensions and macroeconomic instability, which continue to drive volatility across financial markets, keeping traders on edge. Daan’s recent analysis provides a detailed perspective, noting that Ethereum remains rangebound between approximately $2,475 and $2,735. Within this zone, the price has swept both the highs and lows, reflecting a period of consolidation. Significantly, Ethereum has now retested the range high of $2,735 for the fourth time, a level that has repeatedly served as a psychological and technical barrier. According to Daan, this prolonged range play suggests that a breakout—either upward or downward—is on the horizon, likely triggering a substantial move. However, he cautions that until such a breakout occurs, it’s prudent to avoid overcommitting to either bullish or bearish positions. The analyst points out that over the past few weeks, traders have repeatedly bet on breakouts in both directions, only to face choppy conditions that often result in losses. This pattern of indecision has left many investors “chopped up,” as premature bets fail to materialize. With global economic uncertainties adding pressure, Ethereum’s next move hinges on whether bulls can decisively clear the $2,735 resistance or if bears will capitalize on a potential reversal. Until clarity emerges, the market remains a battleground of competing forces. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June Price Action Details: Key Levels To Clear Ethereum is trading at $2,690.46 on the 1-day chart, following a period of consolidation after a sharp decline. After finding support near $1,750 in April, ETH formed a tentative ascending triangle pattern, with recent price action testing key moving averages. The 50-day SMA ($2,310.51) and 100-day SMA ($2,077.91) have been breached upward, while the 200-day SMA ($2,657.01) remains a critical resistance, aligning with the current price zone. This move suggests short-term resilience, setting the stage for a potential test of the $2,750 resistance, a level retested four times since early 2025. A decisive daily close above $2,750, supported by rising volume, could pave the way for a push toward $3,000. The chart reveals rising lows since April, indicating accumulation and renewed buyer interest, particularly around the $2,500-$2,600 range. Increasing volume during recent upticks adds credibility to the breakout attempt, reducing the likelihood of a false move.

However, a rejection at $2,750 might drive the price back to the $2,250-$2,400 support zone. The market remains rangebound between $2,475 and $2,735, per analyst Daan’s insights, with a breakout likely to trigger a significant move. All eyes are on whether ETH can clear $2,750 to confirm upward momentum.

Saylor’s company Strategy now holds nearly 570,000 BTC worth almost $60B, a journey highlighted in a recent Financial Times documentary. Apple is gradually opening up to crypto, now allowing external crypto payment links in iOS apps and supporting stablecoin payments via Apple Pay and Mesh.

2025-06-10T20:59:16,"Bitcoin Rises to $110K as Altcoins Rally; Traders Skeptical of Breakout","Bitcoin recaptured the $110,000 level for the second consecutive day, perhaps dragged higher by even larger gains among altcoins. Up 0.9% more than 1% in the last 24 hours, bitcoin was trading just above $110,000 shortly after the close of U.S. stock markets Tuesday. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, exchange coins and memecoins — has risen 3.3% in the same period of time, mostly thanks to ether ETH, solana SOL, chainlink LINK all gaining 5%-7%. The standout performances, however, were put on by uniswap UNI and aave AAVE, which soared a whooping 24% and 13%, respectively. The move was prompted by optimistic comments on the topic of DeFi by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins on Monday. Things have remained relatively calm on the equities front, with most crypto stocks flat on the day. A notable exception is Semler Scientific (SMLR), a firm that aims to follow Strategy’s (MSTR) playbook and vacuum up as much bitcoin as possible. Shares fell another 10% today, with the stock now trading for less than the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet . Despite the day’s gains, positioning across crypto markets still reflects a largely defensive tone. ""Funding rates and other leverage proxies point toward a steadily cautious sentiment in the market,” Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, pointed out in a Tuesday report. ""The broad risk appetite is remarkably weak, given that BTC is trading close to former all-time highs."" Binance’s BTC perpetual swaps posted negative funding rates on multiple days last week, with the average annualized funding rate now sitting at just 1.3% — a level typically associated with local market bottoms rather than tops, Lunde noted. ""Bitcoin does not usually peak in environments with negative funding rates,"" he wrote, adding that past instances of such positioning have more often preceded rallies than corrections. Flows into leveraged bitcoin ETFs paint a similar picture. The ProShares 2x Bitcoin ETF (BITX) currently holds exposure equivalent to 52,435 BTC — well below its December 2023 peak of 76,755 BTC — and inflows remain muted. This defensive positioning, according to Lunde, leaves room for a potential ""healthy rally"" in BTC to develop. Still, not all market watchers are convinced that the current price action marks the start of a sustainable breakout. ""Is this a true breakout that will continue? In my view, probably not,"" said Kirill Kretov, senior automation expert at CoinPanel. ""More likely, it’s part of the same volatility cycle where we see a rally now, followed by a sharp drop triggered by a negative announcement or some other narrative shift."" According to Kretov, the current environment favors experienced traders who can navigate volatility-driven market structure. Technically, he sees BTC's next key support levels at $105,000 and $100,000 — zones that could be tested if selling pressure returns.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/10/bitcoin-rises-to-110k-as-altcoins-rally-traders-skeptical-of-breakout,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|UNI","Markets|Bitcoin|Uniswap|Aave|Semler scientific|Market Wrap|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T20:53:18,"Crypto wrap: SEC postpones Solana ETFs decision, GameStop adds more Bitcoin","The crypto market finds itself at a pivotal crossroads as regulatory and corporate developments fuel a fresh wave of optimism across digital assets. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its official decision on the Solana ETFs pending revisions. At the same time, GameStop has stunned markets by announcing a new Bitcoin purchase, doubling down on its digital asset strategy amid a broader financial turnaround. These events have injected momentum into the market, reinforcing expectations of a strong altseason in 2025. SEC has requested revisions in Solana ETF filings In a critical move that could influence the trajectory of Solana’s price, the SEC has asked asset managers seeking to launch spot Solana ETFs to revise their S-1 forms within the coming week. This request does not signal rejection, but rather suggests the regulatory body is actively engaged in preparing for a potential approval process. According to insiders, the SEC intends to provide feedback on the updated S-1 filings within the next 30 days, keeping the market hopeful for a July green light. Eric Balchumans, a Senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg, has indicated that we could have a potential altcoin ETF summer with Solana being the first to get the approval.

The SEC’s proactive stance reflects a broader shift toward clearer digital asset regulation, encouraging a wave of institutional players to re-enter the crypto sector. Polymarket bets on approval of the Solana ETFs before year-end Following the SEC’s latest move, prediction market Polymarket, which was recently picked by X as its prediction market maker, now reflects a 91% probability of a spot Solana ETF being approved before the end of 2025. Source: Polymarket This rising optimism has fueled bullish sentiment around Solana, with analysts forecasting a breakout past the consolidation zone. SOL has already surged over 5% following the news, trading around $164 in the mid-North American session, indicating a strong market reaction. With a market cap nearing $100 billion and trading volume hovering at $4.2 billion, Solana appears poised to challenge the $200 resistance level as early as this month. Market analysts such as Ali Martinez believe a parabolic rally could be imminent, especially if it breaks out of the cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart as institutional wallets continue accumulating SOL aggressively.

The gaming retailer revealed it had acquired 4,710 Bitcoins between May 3 and June 10, a move that aligns with its growing pivot toward digital assets. Despite a 17% drop in net sales compared to last year, GameStop significantly reduced its operating loss to $10.8 million. A $35.5 million impairment from restructuring impacted results, yet the company posted a surprising net income of $44.8 million, up from a $32.3 million loss last year. After adjustments, the net income ballooned to $83.1 million, further underscoring the company’s improved financial footing and strategic shifts. GameStop’s cash and liquid asset holdings have grown to $6.4 billion, a sharp rise from just $1 billion a year earlier, giving it ample room for further crypto-related investments. The company also finalised the sale of its Canadian operations on May 4, signalling a broader international restructuring aimed at sharpening focus. Crypto market sentiment has turned bullish across the board Notably, these developments come at a time when market sentiment is rapidly shifting from cautious to bullish, largely driven by institutional confidence and regulatory engagement. The majority of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA,) are in the green as the markets await the Fed meeting later this month . And now with the Solana ETF discussions gaining momentum and GameStop reinforcing its crypto playbook, investors are paying closer attention to what could be the beginning of altseason 2025.

According to the analysis, the Bitcoin balance on cryptocurrency exchanges has decreased by 3.77 million BTC since February 2020. This means that approximately $219 billion worth of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from exchanges. Although this major movement may seem like a sell-off at first glance, according to Alphractal, the opposite is true: This rise is a strong indicator of growing confidence and maturity in the market. Alphractal noted that investors have no intention of selling their Bitcoin by moving it to personal wallets, but rather see the digital asset as a long-term store of value. According to analysts, this indicates that the “HODL” strategy is gaining strength. Related News: BREAKING: Rumors of Solana Spot ETF Approval Emerge, Could Stir Up the Market - Price Reacts With Bitcoin being pulled off exchanges, selling pressure is thought to have significantly decreased, creating a supply squeeze that could make it easier for prices to move upwards in the event of a potential demand increase. Alphractal sees this as a “very bullish signal.” As a result, Alphractal says that the 3.77 million BTC outflow from exchanges is not a sign of panic, but rather a strong belief in the future of Bitcoin. This development shows that Bitcoin is increasingly being adopted as “digital gold” by more and more people. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T20:32:17,"Bitcoin has stayed above $100,000 for 30 straight days, the longest stretch ever","Bitcoin just broke another record by staying above $100,000 for 30 days in a row, the first time that’s ever happened since the cryptocurrency was created. This streak started after its last dip below six figures on May 8, and not once since then has it closed under that level. The price pulled back from its May 22 all-time high of $112,000, dropping to $100,428 by Friday, but heavy weekend buying pushed it back to $105,000. By Monday, it had surged again to $110,000, with traders responding to renewed optimism around US-China trade discussions. The fact that it hasn’t broken below $100K for a full month has crypto traders calling it a key milestone—even if some still see it more as a psychological checkpoint than a technical win. Still, it’s a major line that held strong, and analysts are watching closely to see what’s next. Traders defend $100K on pullbacks Read Harvey, a technical analyst at Wolfe Research, told CNBC the move above $100K wasn’t just about hype. “What really stood out to us was price’s ability to hold that level on the back test, when it briefly fell to $100,000 on Thursday. It also happened to align perfectly with the 50-day moving average,” Read said. He added that he sees the current setup as a launchpad toward the previous high of $112,000. Read also expects Bitcoin to spend a bit more time consolidating around its current level before any breakout to new highs, saying a temporary pause is normal after such a run. While short-term traders are focused on charts and averages, others are looking at the bigger picture. Ben Kurland, CEO of crypto analytics platform DYOR, said this $100,000 level is no longer just about market emotion. “$100,000 isn’t just speculative froth now,” Ben said. “It’s a new floor being tested and held by institutional flows, ETF inflows , and a maturing investor base.” He added that the pattern of short-lived pumps followed by sharp retracements is starting to fade. Ben believes this consolidation is healthy and sets up Bitcoin for the next move. “If $100,000 is the new base,” he said, “then $120,000-$130,000 becomes the next logical zone—especially as macro conditions stabilize and sidelined capital seeks asymmetric upside.” Long-term holders sell, ETFs keep buying While institutions and funds continue to buy, some older holders are starting to cash in. Tyrone Ross, founder and president of advisory firm 401 Financial, said the 30-day stretch above $100K might not be a massive technical feat, but it still matters. “On-chain data shows long-term holders are selling,” Tyrone said. He explained that while demand from ETFs and companies remains strong, retail investors haven’t returned in full force yet. But if Bitcoin keeps holding these levels, he said, retail interest is likely to come back in waves. Tyrone pointed out that May 27 saw a big shift. At that point, when Bitcoin was around $109,000, spending by long-term holders—people who’ve held for at least six months—shot up to around 40,000 Bitcoin, according to CryptoQuant. That’s since dropped all the way down to about 6,000 as of Monday. Over the same stretch, overall 30-day demand has fallen too, from 228,000 Bitcoin down to 126,000. That slowdown might cool the pace of price growth in the short term, according to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant. Still, Bitcoin keeps pushing. On Tuesday, it was trading at roughly $108,800, about 3% below its peak. Earlier that same day, it climbed to $110,500, its highest point since the May 22 record. With this current streak still intact, everyone’s watching to see if $100K becomes more than just a floor—whether it becomes the new normal.

2025-06-10T20:02:08,"BOJ June Meeting Could Trigger Major Moves in Stocks and Crypto – What to Watch","The Bank of Japan’s upcoming monetary policy meeting, scheduled for June 16–17, is drawing intense global attention, and for good reason. As speculation builds, analysts say the central bank’s next move could spark a major shift across risk markets, from Japanese equities to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. BOJ Meeting: Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Boom if QE Returns Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and CIO of Maelstrom, believes the BOJ could soon shift back to quantitative easing (QE), a move that would inject liquidity into the economy and lift risk assets. “If the BOJ delays QT, and restarts selected QE at its June meeting, risk assets are going to fly,” Hayes posted on X on June 10. I don’t think ordinary Japanese plebes would agree. If the BOJ delays QT, and restarts selected QE at its June meeting risk assets are going to fly. LFG $BTC pic.twitter.com/ET08M6tWeS — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 10, 2025 QE, short for quantitative easing, refers to central bank bond purchases designed to keep interest rates low and stimulate economic activity. A shift in this direction could serve as a tailwind for crypto and stock markets, both of which are closely watching Japan’s policy decisions amid rising global volatility. According to a report from Bloomberg, the central bank is expected to slow the pace of its quantitative tightening (QT). Since last summer, the BOJ has been reducing its government bond purchases by ¥400 billion ($2.8 billion) per quarter. But that pace may soon be halved. “The pace of reduction is likely to be eased to around ¥200 billion per quarter,” said Eiji Maeda, a former BOJ executive director and current president of Chibagin Research Institute. “They won’t keep going with ¥400 billion.” Governor Kazuo Ueda’s board is also set to review the existing bond-buying program through 2026 and beyond. Maeda added that once monthly bond purchases reach around ¥2 trillion by early 2027, further reductions will likely pause. Although the BOJ is widely expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% next week, the broader market focus is now on how far and how fast it will scale back its bond purchases. Japan’s inflation has been above the 2% target for three straight years, the highest among G7 nations, fanning expectations that a shift toward more easing could still be on the table. Still, uncertainties around U.S. tariffs and a recent GDP contraction complicate the timing of further rate hikes. “The BOJ must be careful,” Maeda warned. “They shouldn’t rush for normalization when these thick, dark clouds are hanging over the economy.” Bitcoin’s Price Action and BoJ Policy Shift Could Set Stage for New Bull Cycle As investors brace for the BOJ’s June 16 meeting, market focus is intensifying on how policy changes could ripple across global assets, including crypto. The BOJ’s announcement last July to reduce government bond purchases by ¥400 billion per quarter marked a major step toward quantitative tightening. With an interim assessment now due, insiders suggest the central bank may consider a gentler path, cutting purchases by only ¥200 billion per quarter starting in April 2027. Such a shift could indicate a longer-term dovish tilt, potentially spurring capital flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin has responded to Japan’s tightening moves before. For example, on May 22, just two days after Japan’s 30-year bond yield hit a record 3.185%, BTC surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. While currently trading at $109,152, the flagship crypto maintains bullish momentum and strong technical support above $75,000. Source: Cryptonews.com . Price action is now consolidating within a descending triangle, a setup known to precede explosive breakouts. With volume stable and RSI neutral, all eyes are on a potential breakout before July 1. Bitcoin’s recent volatility has left traders torn between optimism and caution, as shifting global capital flows collide with conflicting technical signals. #Bitcoin #BTC https://t.co/ZcWeyewRad — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 10, 2025 If BTC decisively breaches the $110,000 resistance, analysts expect fresh highs toward $115,000–$118,000, igniting the next phase of the bull run.

Nazarov notes in a new YouTube video that the decentralized oracle network is arriving at a point where financial institutions have been reaching out for help with various projects. “At this point, I’ve been – between last year and this year so far – almost everywhere. Last year, we covered a lot of Asia, the Middle East, Australia, many of the top environments where cryptocurrencies and blockchains are getting adopted. This year, with the new stance on regulation in the US, we are very heavily covering all of the US institutions in addition to continuing to cover those in Asia and the Middle East. So I can’t mention exact names, because they want to wait to announce, they have all these processes with NDAs (non-disclosure agreements). It’s a very tightly controlled process, but I would say between last year and this year, we’re in various stages of conversations with probably all the top institutions in those geographies. I think that those top institutions basically want to use the solution that solves all their problems, is used by the other top-tier banks and players, has all the functionality they want, whether that’s identity, data connectivity, orchestration. And there’s really no system other than Chainlink that meets that high standard.” LINK is trading at $14.50 at time of writing.

2025-06-10T20:00:17,"Bitcoin ETFs Set to Reach $1 Trillion Trading Volume Milestone","Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States are nearly crossing the $1 trillion mark in total trading volume. This achievement comes just 17 months after their launch in January 2024. These crypto funds have quickly grown into one of the most active ETF products in the world. Reportedly, it rivaled long-established giants like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and the Invesco Nasdaq-100 ETF. Bitcoin ETFs’ Early Growth Fueled by Market Momentum When Bitcoin ETFs first launched, interest was immediate and strong. In March 2024, they raked in $100 billion in total trading volume, which doubled when Bitcoin’s price hit nearly $74,000. However, this upward trading trend slowed, with Bitcoin’s price between $50,000 and $70,000. The ETFs continued to trade actively during this time, but without the same fast growth rate. Positive momentum returned to the market when Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2024. This event helped Bitcoin break past its previous highs, and the ETFs quickly passed the $500 billion mark in cumulative trading volume. Bitcoin ETF Market Outlook In 2025, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to gain strong momentum, reaching $750 billion in trading volume in February 2025. As of June 9, 2025, the trading volume is at $995.2 billion, very close to the $1 trillion milestone. Bitcoin’s price is also nearly its latest all-time high of $112,000. According the time of writing, the flagship crypto has been trading at $109,055, up by 1,21% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Impressively, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs are now among the biggest crypto funds in the world, with over $120 billion in assets. Most of this comes from top performer BlackRock’s IBIT , which holds $70 billion and handles 79% of the total trading volume. In contrast, Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF, on the other hand, has lost $23 billion due to higher fees. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs have not seen the same level of success . Since launching in July 2024, it has raked in $83.4 billion in trading volume and holds $6.6 billion in assets. Ethereum spot ETFs’ net inflows are $3.4 billion, which is positive, but much smaller than Bitcoin ETFs. Investor Confidence Is Growing At first, many thought only asset managers would benefit from the Bitcoin ETF. However, Bitcoin ’s price rise, rising from $30,000 to over $110,000 since January 2024, shows that the whole market has gained. This growth has helped Bitcoin become a more trusted and mainstream investment, with institutional investors heavily investing in crypto investment funds and showing growing interest in Bitcoin.

2025-06-10T19:55:34,"Trader Predicts Parabolic Sui Rally to New Highs, Says Recent $223,000,000 DEX Hack Gave ‘Amazing Opportunity’","A widely followed crypto analyst says that layer-1 blockchain Sui ( SUI ) is gearing up for a massive breakout to fresh all-time highs. In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Kaleo tells his 703,900 followers on the social media platform X that SUI is suddenly presenting a major buying opportunity. He says that the recent $223 million hack of the Cetus Protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui network, caused SUI’s value to decline, but ultimately gave bulls a chance to position themselves for the next leg up. “Remember last cycle how many times SOL was declared dead because it went down? Every single time the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) was bought, and it came back stronger. I think the recent CETUS exploit gave an amazing opportunity for a dip to stack more SUI. CETUS is officially back with a recovery plan for affected pools. There’s also a plan in place for token compensation for affected users. If anything, the CETUS issue makes me more bullish showing how SUI governance was swift to act together to stop the protocol’s exploit from being any worse and allowing the hacker to get away with the funds. Feel free to cope from the sidelines, but I’m as bullish as I’ve been since I partnered with SUI on them having the opportunity to fill the gap in the monolithic L1 (layer-1) race. Run it back turbo.” Source: Kaleo/X Based on his chart, the trader appears to suggest that SUI print a new all-time high at around $7.50, more than double its current value, perhaps sometime in September of this year. The analyst also says that SUI may be getting ready to breakout of a bullish descending wedge pattern against Bitcoin ( BTC ). “SUI/BTC ratio also looks solid with a clean breakout retest. I see this breaking out and filling the launch wick soon.” Source: Kaleo/X At time of writing, SUI is trading for $3.45.

This amount is over $23 million according to the current market value. The accumulation in question stands out as a significant reserve that the company has not previously disclosed to the public. American Bitcoin launched in March, and Eric Trump serves as the company's chief strategy officer. “Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable BTC accumulation platform on the market,” Eric Trump said in a statement.

American Bitcoin said it considers its BTC reserves a “core strategic asset” and that it is being managed adaptively. The firm’s goal is to bolster its balance sheet strength and increase long-term shareholder value. The company’s accumulation strategy is not a specific BTC target, but instead plans to expand its assets by increasing capital according to market conditions. The company stated that “BTC accumulation is not a byproduct of ABTC’s business; it is the business itself,” and announced that their Layer 2 strategy aims to transform Bitcoin production into long-term ownership. *This is not investment advice.
