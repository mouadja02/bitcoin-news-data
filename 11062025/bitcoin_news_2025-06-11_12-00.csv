2025-06-11T09:37:59,"Anonymous whale opens $425M bet on Bitcoin","A mystery whale has deployed nearly $30 million over three days to build a massive leveraged Bitcoin ( BTC ) position, according to data from Lookonchain . The trader, identified by wallet address “0x1f25…”, created a new wallet and initially deposited 10M USDC to Hyperliquid, opening a 20x leveraged long position on Bitcoin. They then added another 2.35M USDC yesterday, followed by another 10M USDC today. At press time, the position stood at 3,877 BTC ($424.7M) with an entry price of $108,622 and a liquidation price of $103,100. The trader is currently showing unrealized gains of $3.59M. “0x1f25…” wallet. Source: Hypurrscan.io Bitcoin bulls target $150,000 after breaking key resistance The whale’s aggressive positioning comes as Bitcoin surged past the $110,000 mark, with analysts suggesting the next potential target could be $150,000 if technical indicators continue to align. Prominent crypto analyst TradingShot observed that Bitcoin’s current rally has invalidated several short-term bearish patterns and broken through a critical resistance zone. The analyst noted that Bitcoin recently rebounded at the lower high trendline of a three-year ascending channel, with this price structure appearing thrice in Bitcoin’s ongoing ‘channel up’ formation. Each instance triggered at least a 101% gain. From the April 7 bottom, a 101% rally would put Bitcoin at the $150,000 mark, a clean technical target supported by historical precedent, strong channel support, and renewed breakout momentum . Analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicted that the current phase is likely a short consolidation period before increased upward momentum. Van de Poppe suggests the ideal buying range sits around $107,000 to $108,000 as BTC prepares for what could be another historic run. If Bitcoin’s relative strength index ( RSI ) retests 75 by the end of the month, analyst PlanB suggests the June closing price for BTC would be around $130,000. Meanwhile, investment firm Bernstein maintains a $200,000 price target, calling it a “high-conviction but conservative” forecast. Institutional demand remains strong, with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) (NASDAQ: MSTR ) buying over 1000 BTC this week, worth approximately $110.2 million in total. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now manage over $120 billion in assets, highlighting BTC’s transition into a mainstream asset class.

2025-06-11T09:35:18,"BTC: The Most Cost-Effective Way To Buy Bitcoin","Summary Bitcoin has been the primary beneficiary of investment capital in the Digital Asset space since the approval of spot ETFs in early 2024. June is showing a potential change in sentiment, with negative net flow through June 7th. With Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust being a notable exception, most US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs have negative BTC-denominated AUM growth year to date. BTC remains a cost-effective way to get exposure to an anti-fiat debasement trade in 2025. Through the first week of June, Digital Asset investment net flows came in at $224 million. While this was the seventh consecutive week of positive net flow in the asset class, the week ended June 7th saw the weakest inflow story in nearly two months. Furthermore, if you take out iShares ETF products, year to date net flow into Digital Assets is actually negative. In this article, covering the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF ( BTC ), we'll look at capital flow trends in the Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) ETF products, issuer flows, as well as broader considerations for investors interested in Bitcoin. Capital Flow Winners and Losers There is no doubt at this point that Bitcoin has been the primary beneficiary of investment capital in the Digital Asset space since the approval of spot ETFs in early-2024. That outperformance continued through the first 5 months of 2025 with Bitcoin accounting for roughly 90% of year to date net flow and 86% of the Digital Asset financial product AUM: Asset (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin -$57 $10,143 $151,223 Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) $296 $1,701 $14,092 Multi-asset -$5.9 -$142 $6,763 Solana ( SOL-USD ) -$1.1 $79 $1,403 XRP ( XRP-USD ) -$4.0 $194 $1,216 Total $225 $11,342 $175,869 Source: CoinShares, as of June, 7th 2025 However, June is showing a potential change in sentiment, with many of the high-fliers from the last 12–18 months showing negative net flow through June 7th. This is happening while Ethereum - a hugely disappointing laggard post-ETF approvals - masked what would have been a week of negative net outflow were it not for inflow of just under $300 million through the first seven days of the month. Admittedly, this is just one week of data in a longer-term story. But it's interesting to me, nonetheless. The provider details are also quite telling because one product issuer is essentially the entire market so far this year and in June as well: Provider (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM iShares $330 $12,732 $72,844 Grayscale -$16 -$1,741 $29,339 Fidelity -$168 -$274 $20,511 ARK 21 Shrs -$25 -$47 $4,789 Bitwise -$13 -$273 $4,219 Total $225 $11,342 $175,869 Source: CoinShares, as of June, 7th 2025 Were it not for the $330 million month to date net flows into iShares products, investment in Digital Asset ETFs would have been negative through the first week of June. Unlike the asset breakout, this is not a new trend. The year to date story is quite similar with $12.7 billion in positive net flows year to date while most of the other major asset managers have actually seen outflow. This is indeed the case for Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise. This would seemingly indicate that it is the asset class itself, rather than a simple 'fee flight' migration from Grayscale products. ETF BTC Balances 12/31/2024 7/9/2025 Change YoY iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) 552,168 662,707 110,539 20.0% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ( FBTC ) 202,800 196,264 -6,536 -3.2% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ( ARKB ) 46,729 45,616 -1,113 -2.4% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) 40,196 37,783 -2,413 -6.0% BTC 38,342 43,436 5,094 13.3% Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) 206,835 185,234 -21,601 -10.4% Total Spot ETFs 1,286,857 1,365,429 78,572 6.1% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The clear outlier in this table is IBIT with the 20% year to date change in BTC holdings. Grayscale's Mini Trust, which is up 13.3% in BTC-denominated holdings, has jumped BITB as a 'top-5' fund this year by AUM but has failed to make up for the 21.6k Bitcoins that have come out of Grayscale's flagship Bitcoin product. If it was just a 'fee flight' story, I would think Grayscale's Mini Trust would be a bigger beneficiary of asset flow than IBIT: Fund Comparison Inception Expense Ratio AUM IBIT 01/05/2024 0.25% $71.85 ARKB 01/10/2024 0.21% $4.97 FBTC 01/10/2024 0.25% $20.49 BITB 01/10/2024 0.20% $4.10 GBTC 09/25/2013 1.50% $20.13 BTC 07/31/2024 0.15% $4.73 Source: Seeking Alpha, June 10th 2025, AUM in billions While still far more competitive than the 1.5% expense ratio seen through GBTC, IBIT is more expensive than Grayscale's Mini Trust and two additional offerings with top 5 AUM. Grayscale's Mini Trust is the most cost-effective, with just a .15% expense ratio. Data by YCharts If we look at the total return of both IBIT and BTC since the inception of the latter at the end of July 2024, we do indeed see BTC gets a very slight edge in total return. For a 'set it and forget it' type of investor, BTC will ultimately outperform IBIT since it's 10 bps cheaper annually. That said, this is not necessarily a meaningful boost in return for an asset that has appreciated in value by over 66% in the last 11 months. For those who want liquidity, IBIT is the clear winner. But for longer-term Bitcoin bulls, BTC will work perfectly fine. Cycle Top and Global Liquidity In previous articles for Seeking Alpha covering Bitcoin and cyclical sell indicators, we've looked at metrics like MVRV and Pi Cycle Top. From where I sit, the fundamental argument for Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment network isn't all that compelling, given the lackluster growth in usage and scaling. However, the belief by many that Bitcoin is 'Digital Gold' continues to carry the asset as an 'anti-fiat currency' instrument. As I see it, that view is still a winning one until price returns stop moving with global M2: BTC vs M2 (BGeometrics) I still like this chart quite a bit, and it shows Bitcoin price appreciation could realistically be looked at as a liquidity sponge when global M2 starts to surge on a year-over-year basis. Isolating down to the last 12 months shows Bitcoin's price moving with a lag when global M2 growth hits 7% year over year: BTC vs M2, 1 yr (BGeometrics) Our first example shows M2 growth at 7% in late September 2024. This preceded a 67% rip higher in BTC from $63k to $105k in December. We again saw 7% YoY growth in global M2 at the end of April. Bitcoin's return since then is slightly above 11%. Notably, M2 growth does not appear to be slowing down just yet, with the YoY change again hitting 7.5% as of June 2nd. Should history repeat, we could reasonably expect a Bitcoin price closer to $158k later this summer. Risks The old adage fits here; past performance is not a forecast of future returns. Just because money printing by global governments/central banks has produced higher Bitcoin prices so far, it doesn't necessarily mean that dynamic will continue. Bitcoin was initially intended to be a monetary asset for the people to use on-chain and with each other. 'HODLing' via ETFs isn't exactly what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. Furthermore, Bitcoin remains a new asset relative to historical fiat currency substitutes: Bitcoin/Gold Ratio ( Longtermtrends ) Measured against Gold, Bitcoin hasn't gone anywhere since November 2021. I will reiterate what I've said since I first started covering Bitcoin for Seeking Alpha several years ago; those seeking refuge from fiat currency debasement don't need to pick between the two when they can just buy both Bitcoin and Gold. Closing Summary I remain long Bitcoin both directly and through the ETF wrapper. While I personally like FBTC for my long-term position, I think Grayscale's Mini Trust is a perfectly fine way to allocate to Bitcoin in a traditional investment account. BTC is the most cost-effective way to buy that exposure, and I believe the fact that BTC is the only major spot ETF that has seen positive year to date inflows is a testament to that cost-effectiveness.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793978-btc-the-most-cost-effective-way-to-buy-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|TRADING","BTC-USD|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T09:34:00,"Ukraine Drafts Bill to Let Central Bank Hold Bitcoin in National Reserves","Ukraine lawmakers have introduced a draft bill that could allow the country’s central bank to include Bitcoin and other crypto in its national reserves. The bill, submitted on June 10, was put forward by a group of Members of Parliament led by Yaroslav Zheleznyak from the Holos party. It proposes amendments to the law “On the National Bank of Ukraine,” specifically to permit the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to hold virtual assets alongside gold and foreign currencies. Ukraine’s Central Bank May Soon Hold Crypto — If It Chooses To The draft law, registered as bill No. 13356 , does not require the central bank to invest in crypto. Instead, it gives the NBU the option to do so at its own discretion. Decisions about whether to allocate reserves into digital assets, such as when, how, or how much, would remain entirely with the bank. “Under this draft law, we authorize the National Bank of Ukraine to include virtual assets in the country’s reserves,” Zheleznyak said. “However, decisions regarding the timing, method, and volume of such inclusion are left entirely to the discretion of the central bank.” JUST IN: Ukraine officially introduces bill to establish a Strategic BTC Reserve. pic.twitter.com/VlxcXnwz9N — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) June 11, 2025 The proposal marks a notable shift in Ukraine’s stance toward integrating digital assets into its financial framework. Although the bill does not mandate the use of crypto in reserves, it creates a legal foundation for the NBU to act if it chooses to in the future. “If [the National Bank] doesn’t want to invest in crypto, it doesn’t have to,” Zheleznyak clarified. The draft bill reflects broader interest among Ukrainian lawmakers in aligning the country with global trends in financial innovation. Zheleznyak said a state-backed crypto reserve could support macroeconomic stability and help drive the growth of Ukraine’s digital economy. “Proper management of crypto reserves will help strengthen macroeconomic stability and create new opportunities for the development of the digital economy,” he wrote on Telegram. In a video discussion with Binance’s regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, Kirill Khomyakov, Zheleznyak highlighted growing international interest in crypto as a reserve asset. He pointed to countries like the United States, El Salvador, Switzerland, and Brazil as examples of jurisdictions moving toward strategic digital asset holdings. The bill has been submitted to Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, and is now awaiting further consideration. If passed, it would position Ukraine among a small but growing group of nations exploring crypto’s role in sovereign monetary policy. Ukraine Finalizing Crypto Legalization Bill Amid Plans for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Ukraine is preparing to take another major step toward integrating crypto into its national financial framework. Following the central bank’s move to potentially hold Bitcoin in its reserves, lawmakers are now pushing to legalize cryptocurrency use nationwide by mid-2025. The draft legislation, expected to be submitted after the New Year, has been developed with input from the National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund. Ukraine plans to legalize crypto by Q1 2025, with profits taxed similarly to securities with IMF and European expert guidance. #ukraine #crypto https://t.co/0hJPWs511R — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 12, 2024 It proposes a regulatory and tax framework that treats crypto assets similarly to securities, profits would be taxed only upon conversion to fiat, with no exemptions granted for digital asset transactions. Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the parliamentary Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy, said the bill is nearly ready for its first reading . While some regulatory details, such as financial monitoring mechanisms, are still under discussion, Hetmantsev stated that the core of the bill is complete and on track for approval in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s ambitions extend beyond regulation. Lawmakers are also drafting legislation that would enable the country to establish a strategic national Bitcoin reserve . Yaroslav Zhelezniak, deputy head of the finance committee, confirmed the bill is in its final stages and will soon be introduced. If passed, Ukraine would become the first European country to officially hold Bitcoin as a state asset, a move that could position the nation as a leader in institutional crypto adoption.

The firm announced Wednesday it has partnered with layer-1 blockchain Flare FLR to deploy $100 million XRP to generate yield on its treasury holdings. The initiative marks the first large-scale use of Flare’s FAssets system, which enables non-smart contract tokens like XRP to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, the press release said. VivoPower plans to generate yield through Flare-native protocols such as Firelight and reinvest the income to expand its XRP holdings. The company said it will also adopt payment firm Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin as its cash-equivalent reserve. ""It’s no longer enough to simply hold XRP; the duty to our shareholders is to make it productive,"" CEO and executive chairman Kevin Chin said in a statement. ""Adopting Ripple’s RLUSD is a cornerstone of this strategy, providing the stability and compliance this next-generation treasury demands."" For Flare, the deal is a milestone of institutional validation, Flare co-founder Hugo Philion pointed out. ""Our FAssets system [...] is more than just a bridge; it’s a gateway that allows institutions to bring assets like XRP into programmable DeFi environments to generate yield, all while retaining their fundamental security,"" he said. VivoPower is part of the growing roster of public firms raising money to purchase and add digital assets to their treasuries, a playbook popularized by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) that has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin BTC. The firm's latest move comes shortly after tapping BitGo's over-the-counter trading desk for acquiring an initial $100 million trench of XRP tokens. VivoPower last month said that it entered into an agreement for a $121 million private share placement, with the fundraising led by Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, chairman of Eleventh Holding Company, according to a SEC filing .",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/11/vivopower-to-deploy-usd100m-in-xrp-on-flare-add-ripple-usd-for-treasury-operations,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP","Finance|XRP|Flare Network|Ripple|News",cryptocompare

Here's Why…","The largest institutional Bitcoin bull Strategy (MicroStrategy) continues its aggressive buying. While Strategy's buying strategy was thought to be positive for BTC, a negative comment came from Swiss cryptocurrency bank Sygnum. Accordingly, Sygnum Bank said in a recent report that Strategy’s aggressive buying strategy could undermine Bitcoin’s safe haven status. Strategy’s goal of owning 5% of the BTC supply could undermine Bitcoin’s suitability as a reserve asset for central banks, according to the report. “Strategy's 3% stake in Bitcoin is approaching problematic levels, threatening Bitcoin's reserve asset status.” So far, Strategy has purchased a total of 582,000 Bitcoins, which is almost 3% of the BTC supply. The bank noted that Strategy leveraged the convertible bond to buy more BTC, as well as the momentum of its own stock price during bull runs. However, Sygnum Bank said that if the BTC price enters a prolonged decline and Strategy’s stock price falls below the conversion prices of its outstanding bonds, the structure that Strategy has set up will crack and it may be forced to liquidate some of its Bitcoin assets to meet its debt obligations. “If Strategy chooses to sell Bitcoin to avoid the additional burden of a stock decline, the outcome could be very damaging for the market.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T09:22:28,"Societe Generale Adds Stablecoin to Solana: Solaxy Is the Best Crypto to Buy","Societe Generale-FORGE (SG-FORGE), the digital-asset entity associated with the French Societe Generale, is set to launch USD CoinVertible (USDCV) on Ethereum and Solana. The announcement came in a press release, where SG-FORGE explained that: SG-FORGE will propose to its clients instant 24/7 conversion between fiat currencies and stablecoin, enabling immediate, around-the-clock transactions in both USD and EUR. — Societe Generale-FORGE, Press Release The new USDCV will come approximately two years after the release of EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) in April 2023 , the first institutional stablecoin, designed to ‘bridge the gap between traditional capital markets and the digital assets ecosystem.’ Both USDCV and EURCV will be available on exchanges to brokers, payment processors, retail clients, and institutional investors. This announcement comes in a context where Solana is already experiencing increased market trust, and the charts are showing it. $SOL Is Up in Charts as Solana ETFs Are Four Months Away for SEC’s Approval $SOL is currently up by 6% over the past week and 4.80% in the past 24 hours, which shows a steady increase, rather than a passing chart bleep. A welcome change after a sketchy start of the month, we think. One of the main reasons why Solana is outdoing itself is the new Solana ETFs on the horizon. The SEC has requested the issuers to update their S-1 fillings, which pushed back any decision by at least two to four months. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart believes that this makes a favorable SEC decision more than likely, stating that: Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in the next few days. If we’re gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — I wouldn’t expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest.’ — James Seyffart, X Post Seyffart’s previous predictions still stand, as he gave Solana’s ETFs a 90% approval chance in 2025 . The SEC’s response explains $SOL’s surge in the charts and shows that Solana is on its way to greener pastures. Especially with the new Layer 2 upgrade coming in the form of Solaxy ($SOLX), which aims to upgrade Solana’s ecosystem in 2025 and beyond. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Layer 2 Upgrade Brings Faster and Cheaper Transactions Solaxy ($SOLX) is Solana’s first-ever Layer 2 upgrade that promises to fix Solana’s core issue: network congestion, which is currently responsible for a variety of blockchain-related problems. This includes slow and even failed transactions, which ultimately translate into higher chain fees. Solaxy achieves this thanks to its off-chain execution, allowing for near-instant finality, while its parallel transaction processing ensures ultra-low latency. These are critical improvements, designed to improve the user’s experience during high-traffic hours. Based on the project’s utility and roadmap, our analysts predict that $SOLX may reach $0.032 by the end of 2025. Given the token’s current price of $0.001752, we’re looking at a potential ROI of 1,726% if the token performs well. Long-term, following successful implementation, widespread adoption, and continuous developmental support, $SOLX could reach as high as $0.2 by the end of 2026. In clear numbers, this translates to an ROI of 11,315%. $SOLX’s presale is set to end in little over five days, so the window of opportunity to buy the token at its current presale price ($0.001752) is closing fast. Solaxy has already accumulated over $47M so far, which makes this one of the best presales of 2025 and one of the cheapest crypto to buy at the same time. You can buy your $SOLX today if you want to invest in the project early, which should improve your profits over the long term. Is Solana in a Bullish Cycle? Based on Solana’s latest chart performance and the SEC’s upcoming (hopefully) green light, we think Solana may be in a bull cycle. And with Solana pumping, we also expect Solaxy ($SOLX) to make it big post-launch, which is just around the corner. Based on the current context and Solaxy’s explicit utility within Solana’s ecosystem, $SOLX may see a massive post-launch pump. This means that, with five days left to the presale, you either buy now or go home. Remember, this isn’t financial advice.

2025-06-11T09:18:15,"RichMiner: Ordinary people rely on cloud mining to catch the “Trump economic express train”","As the policy direction after the 2025 US presidential election becomes clearer, crypto assets and digital energy-related industries are ushering in a new round of growth dividends. Especially after Trump once again proposed “revitalizing US energy sovereignty” and “promoting the liberalization of the digital economy”, cloud mining has become one of the industries that benefited significantly. With this favorable wind, global users are entering the mining market with a low threshold through platforms such as RichMiner, realizing the real “policy + technology” double dividend realization. Today, ordinary people are no longer just spectators, but with the help of cloud mining technology, they can easily catch this “Trump economic express train”. Trump supports Bitcoin and releases benefits to miners In multiple speeches and interviews, Trump emphasized the need to “bring Bitcoin mining back to the United States” and emphasized that “the United States should be the center of the global crypto mining industry.” This is a big boon to cloud mining platforms and mining infrastructure, especially services running in the United States or cooperative friendly countries. Trump said at a financial forum: “We can’t continue to let innovation flow to other countries. The United States must dominate crypto technology, not suppress it.” He supports the establishment of a regulatory system that can protect investors without excessively intervening in the market, which is a great boon to formal platforms such as cloud mining, exchanges, and wallet services. Trump said he would: legalize and encourage Bitcoin mining in the United States, support Bitcoin as a strategic asset, and protect users’ freedom to own and use digital assets This policy orientation provides fertile ground for the development of cloud mining platforms, and also gives ordinary users the opportunity to obtain long-term benefits like institutional investors. It also creates a positive policy environment for legal and compliant cloud mining platforms such as RichMiner, and paves the way for ordinary people to participate in the encryption field with low barriers. Why choose RichMiner cloud mining? Among many cloud mining platforms, RichMiner has become the first choice for global investors because it continues to lead in many key dimensions and truly realizes the user experience of “low threshold, high return, safe and stable”. RichMiner cloud mining advantages; Global computing power scheduling, higher mining efficiency RichMiner is deployed in top mining farms in many countries around the world, integrating multi-currency computing power such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, DOGE, and dynamically allocates mining machine resources through intelligent algorithms, so that every investment can obtain maximum mining efficiency. Zero technical threshold, suitable for everyone Users do not need to purchase mining machines or understand blockchain technology. They can access the cloud mining system with just a few simple steps. Newbies can also get started quickly and achieve passive income in the true sense.

2025-06-11T09:08:40,"Uniswap breaks out of inverse head-and-shoulders, targets 37% upside ahead","Uniswap is showing strong signs of a bullish reversal after breaking out of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart. According to data crypto.news, Uniswap ( UNI ) UNI shot up over 20% in the past 24 hours, hitting a high of $8.61 on June 11, up 84% from its April low. Its market cap has surpassed $5 billion, flipping that of Aave ( AAVE ). Meanwhile, its daily trading volume increased by more than 150% over the previous day to nearly $1.39 billion. In the derivatives market, open interest surged 54% to a record $713 million, showing that more traders are betting long. The long/short ratio is also above 1, which usually means more people are expecting prices to rise. From a technical standpoint, UNI appears poised for more sustained gains, having broken out of multiple bullish patterns on the daily chart. UNI broke out of an inverse head and shoulders and confirmed it with a strong bullish candle. It also formed a golden cross earlier this week, when the 20-day moving average crossed above the 50-day, a common buy signal, as reported earlier by crypto.news. UNI has broken out of an inverse head and shoulder pattern — June 11 | Source: crypto.news To add to the momentum, UNI has broken out of a months-long downtrend defined by lower highs and lower lows. It’s now above key resistance, and both the MACD and RSI indicators are trending upward. UNI MACD and RSI chart — June 11 | Source: crypto.news If the breakout stays intact, the inverse head and shoulders pattern points to a potential move toward $10.40, roughly 37% above current levels. That target also aligns with the 24.7% Fibonacci retracement level, adding more weight to its importance. You might also like: Myria token jumps as crypto market bounces in Bitcoin-led rally The ongoing rally appears to be driven in part by Uniswap’s June 10 announcement of its new Smart Wallet, which aims to streamline onchain interactions by removing manual token approvals and enabling features like gas abstraction. Further hopes of regulatory clarity in the U.S. may have further contributed to the bullish sentiment. On June 9, SEC Chair Paul Atkins indicated that the agency is working on an “innovation exemption” framework to ease DeFi platforms’ path to market. The announcement sparked renewed optimism across the cryptocurrency market, with many viewing it as a potential catalyst for a “DeFi Summer 2.0” revival. Since Uniswap is one of the largest and most widely used decentralized exchanges, it has been particularly responsive to these developments. Daily active addresses on the Uniswap network have surged 92% in the past 24 hours, a strong signal that user engagement is rebounding as bullish momentum builds. UNI’s rally is also being supported by Bitcoin’s recovery, which saw the asset climb above $110,000 on hopes tied to U.S.–China trade negotiations in London. Even with strong momentum and bullish indicators, traders are closely watching a key support level at $8.20, which corresponds to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement. This level often acts as the first line of support during a healthy uptrend, making it a critical zone to hold for continued bullish momentum. A drop below this may trigger short-term consolidation or a minor pullback before the uptrend resumes. But a decisive move below $7.50 would invalidate the current bullish structure. In that case, UNI could retrace further toward $4.70, where stronger buying interest might re-emerge.

2025-06-11T09:01:41,"Bitcoin Winter Is Over, Says Michael Saylor","With just 450 BTC mined daily and public companies like his own aggressively acquiring Bitcoin, Saylor argues the supply-demand imbalance is driving inevitable price appreciation. He also mentioned the growing political and institutional support, including pro-Bitcoin stances from Donald Trump and key financial regulators. Meanwhile, analysts believe that a wave of crypto ETF approvals could trigger an “ETF summer.” However, not all corporate crypto bets have paid off. GameStop’s recent $513 million BTC purchase failed to boost Q1 performance. No More Crypto Winter? Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, dismissed people’s fears of another crypto market winter by saying that Bitcoin’s trajectory is now locked toward $1 million due to its accelerating adoption and limited supply. In a recent Bloomberg interview , Saylor confidently stated, “Winter is not coming back,” and he argued that Bitcoin reached a point where the only logical direction is upwards. He also talked about the sharp contrast in supply and demand, and explained that just 450 Bitcoin are made available by miners each day, which is roughly equivalent to $50 million at current prices. If this daily supply continues to be absorbed, Saylor believes the price will be forced to rise. Saylor spoke about how public companies, including his own, are playing a key role in driving up demand. In fact, Strategy purchased 582,000 Bitcoin since 2020, which is now worth around $63.85 billion. According to Saylor, these firms are “buying the entire natural supply,” and only a relatively small daily investment is needed to impact the market. However, he acknowledged that if Bitcoin does soar to $500,000 or even $1 million, large-scale volatility could return. Strategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: Saylor Tracker ) Pointing to macroeconomic and political tailwinds, Saylor explained that the broader environment now supports Bitcoin. He pointed to recent endorsements from US President Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and SEC Chair Paul Atkins, all of whom expressed strong institutional backing for the crypto king. He also pointed out that traditional banks are preparing to offer Bitcoin custody, which is a big step toward mainstream adoption. While Trump expressed his support for Bitcoin, some of his policy decisions were seen as catalysts for short-term price declines, including a 40% drop from Bitcoin’s January peak of $109,000. Still, Saylor is unfazed and sees these fluctuations as part of a broader upward trend. Additionally, he mentioned the role of Bitcoin ETFs, particularly those led by BlackRock and other major players, in driving daily Bitcoin purchases. In his view, these inflows , along with new entrants like nation-states, reinforce the bullish outlook. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) For example, Pakistan recently signaled its intent to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which is a move that Samson Mow of JAN3 suggested could allow the country to “front-run” the US if it doesn’t act swiftly. Trump’s creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in March could help the US stay in the race, but Saylor’s message is clear: the momentum behind Bitcoin is too strong to ignore, and the conditions are aligning for a historic price surge. Altcoin ETF Summer Could Start Soon The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be on the verge of approving a new wave of crypto-linked ETFs, and analysts believe this could be the potential start of an “ altcoin ETF summer ” as early as next month. According to a note that was shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart and senior analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC could approve ETFs tracking broad crypto indexes in July, with Solana likely leading the way. These ETFs aim to provide diversified exposure to the cryptocurrency market. So far, Bloomberg analysts assigned a 90% chance of approval for the initial batch by July 2. Major players like Grayscale and Bitwise filed for these crypto bundle ETFs, and the SEC is also evaluating applications that focus specifically on Solana, XRP, and staking-based products. While decisions on Solana and staking ETFs could arrive later this year, there are signs the SEC might act sooner. Reports from Blockworks suggest that the SEC asked fund issuers to revise their Solana ETF filings, which indicates that there is active dialogue and growing momentum behind the products. Basket-style ETFs are seen as an attractive option for investors who are unsure which tokens will outperform. Duncan Moir, president of 21Shares, explained at the Proof of Talk event in Paris that basket products offer a way to gain market exposure without betting on a single asset. He expects these types of ETFs to become increasingly popular as more asset managers join the market and compete to launch innovative exchange-traded products. Seyffart’s forecast that Solana and staking ETFs will lead the next phase of ETF approvals coincides with broader optimism in the industry. Nate Geraci , president of the ETF Store, said that the SEC seems poised to “open the floodgates on crypto ETFs,” which could represent the final hurdle before major brokerages begin offering direct spot crypto trading. Looking further ahead, Balchunas also pointed out that there’s a strong likelihood that an actively managed meme coin ETF could debut by 2026. GameStop’s Bitcoin Bet Fails to Lift Q1 Although Saylor is convinced that a Bitcoin winteris a thing of the past, GameStop Corp reported mixed financial results for the first quarter ending May 3. After-hours trading also saw its shares drop more than 3.5% to just above $29. Q1 overview (Source: GameStop ) The company revealed a decline in revenue to $732.4 million, missing analyst expectations of $754.2 million and falling 17% from the $881.8 million that was posted during the same period last year. The drop was attributed to persistent challenges in physical game sales, according to brokerage IG. However, operational metrics showed improvement, with the company turning a profit of $44.8 million compared to a net loss of $32.3 million a year prior. Despite the revenue miss, GameStop’s cash position is still quite strong. The company reported $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which is a sharp increase from $1 billion a year ago. This financial strength comes at a time when the company is starting to pivot into Bitcoin investment. On May 28, GameStop revealed its first Bitcoin purchase of 4,710 BTC, valued at approximately $513 million at the time. The firm funded the acquisition through debt financing by launching a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. GameStop YTD stock price (Source: Google Finance ) While GameStop did not specify a long-term target for its Bitcoin holdings, it indicated flexibility as it may sell its Bitcoin if needed. The move places GameStop among the growing number of firms treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, although the stock declined roughly 3.8% year-to-date. The company’s all-time high of over $80 in January 2021 remains a far cry from current levels.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9523/bitcoin-winter-is-over-says-michael-saylor,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T09:00:47,"Bitcoin Back At $109,000, But HODLer Profit-Taking Down 89%","On-chain data shows the veterans of the Bitcoin market are taking 89% less profits compared to the May peak, despite prices being similar now. Bitcoin Realized Profit For 1Y+ Hands Is Relatively Low Right Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Realized Profit of the seasoned hands on the Bitcoin network. The “Realized Profit” refers to an indicator that measures, as its name implies, the amount of profit that the BTC investors are realizing through their selling. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being transacted or ‘sold’ on the chain to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If the previous selling value is less than the current price for any token, then that particular token’s sale is contributing to profit realization. Related Reading: Toncoin Heading Toward 40% Breakout, Pattern Could Suggest The amount of profit realized in the sale is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit sums up this value for all tokens being transferred to find the total for the network as a whole. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Profit of the entire userbase isn’t of interest, but just that of a specific part of it: the 1+ year holders. These are the investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than a year, without having involved them in a transaction even once. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their tokens, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. As such, this part of the userbase with its significant holding time would include the resolute diamond hands of the market. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Profit for these HODLers over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit of the 1+ year investors observed a huge spike in late May. This sharp profit-taking spree from these seasoned hands came as BTC surged to $110,000 following its post all-time high (ATH) pullback. Shortly after the selloff from this cohort, BTC started on a decline. During the past day, though, the asset has appeared to have finally shoved off this bearish momentum, as it has once more returned above the $109,000 mark. This time, however, there hasn’t been any significant reaction from the diamond hands. Currently, the 24-hour simple moving average (SMA) of the group’s Realized Profit sits at $13.6 million, which is 89% down compared to the $126 million peak from last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Defies Bears: Price Nears $108,000 Despite $250M Exchange Inflows It’s possible that the veterans of the market think there is more to come in the latest Bitcoin rally, so they are choosing to HODL strong.

2025-06-11T08:55:57,"GameStop’s revenue dropped by 17% after pivot to BTC","GameStop saw its stock drop over 3.5% after-hours on Tuesday, after reporting a steep 17% decline in first-quarter revenue, landing at $732.4 million, down from $881.8 million a year earlier. This comes as the company pushes deeper into crypto while its core retail business keeps shrinking. Analysts had expected stronger performance at $754.2 million, but physical game sales and hardware demand continued to fall across the board. Despite the slump in revenue, the company reported a net income of $44.8 million, flipping from a $32.3 million net loss in the same quarter last year. Operating losses also narrowed significantly to $10.8 million, compared to $50.6 million in Q1 2024. But the financial upside didn’t move investors. GME shares slipped to just over $29, and have fallen 3.8% year-to-date. The decline came even after the company announced a major Bitcoin acquisition last month. GameStop buys Bitcoin, cuts stores, and dumps Canada On May 28, GameStop disclosed it had bought 4,710 bitcoins, spending about $513 million on the purchase. The company said the buy was funded through debt financing, and at the same time launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering to raise additional funds. It confirmed in March that the board had approved using Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Between May 3 and June 10, the entire 4,710 BTC was added to its books. But there’s still no word on how much more it might plan to buy—or when it might sell. While the company is throwing cash into crypto, its traditional operations are bleeding. It shut down nearly 600 stores in the U.S. in 2024, and just confirmed plans to close a “significant number” more in 2025. Hardware and accessories, which includes both new and used video games, saw a 32% revenue drop for the quarter. GameStop is also pulling out of other markets. It sold its Canadian business, known as Electronics Boutique Canada, in early May. That subsidiary ran all physical stores and the e-commerce platform across Canada. The company said it also expects the sale of its French operations to close sometime in fiscal year 2025. All these exits and shutdowns come as GameStop tries to cut costs. The company said the latest $10.8 million operating loss includes $35.5 million in impairment charges related to international restructuring. That means the numbers would have looked even better without the overseas shakeups. Revenue tanks, cash pile explodes, stock stays flat Even though GameStop is closing shops and losing retail momentum, it’s got more cash than ever. As of the latest report, the company holds $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, a massive jump from the $1 billion it held at the same point in 2024. That growing war chest could fund more Bitcoin purchases down the line, but management hasn’t laid out any targets yet. GameStop noted that it could choose to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings at any time if cash is needed. That conditional approach signals the investment might not be permanent. Meanwhile, the ecommerce platform has been expanded to support digital downloads and online merchandise, but there’s no indication yet that those upgrades are bringing in enough money to offset the losses in physical retail. No figures were broken out for online-only sales. All this is happening while the company’s stock still lags far below its $80 all-time high from January 2021, when WallStreetBets fueled one of the most chaotic retail trading frenzies in history. That hype has long worn off. GameStop is now left with a collapsing store footprint, a volatile new crypto balance sheet, and a pile of cash it hasn’t figured out how to use.

Introduced by Representative Mark Wright, the resolution was adopted following a June 10 Regular Session of the House of Representatives, where it passed with unanimous support in a 90–0 vote. HR 317 creates a new subcommittee under the House Committee on Commerce to assess how emerging technologies are shaping the state’s economy, legislation, and daily life. The subcommittee is required to begin its work before September 1, 2025, and submit a final report by February 1, 2026, to the House Committee on Commerce and the David R. Poynter Legislative Research Library. The report will include an analysis of current use cases for AI, blockchain, and cryptocurrency in Louisiana, as well as a comparison with developments in other US states. The panel is tasked with evaluating cybersecurity risks, privacy concerns, and regulatory challenges, alongside opportunities related to economic growth, workforce development, and public-sector innovation. It will also explore whether new state laws are needed to manage these technologies safely and effectively. You might also like: Elon Musk called it an “abomination” — but the Big Beautiful Bill might be crypto’s backdoor stimulus To support an inclusive review process, the resolution calls on the subcommittee to host public hearings and gather expert testimony, while also engaging educators, students, and business owners through dedicated community forums. The subcommittee will consist of members of the House Committee on Commerce, with the committee chair or a designee presiding over the first meeting. Over the years, Louisiana has firmly positioned itself as a pro-crypto pioneer . In September 2024, the state became the first in the U.S. to accept cryptocurrency payments for government services, allowing residents to pay fines and fees with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Lightning Network, and USD Coin. Representative Wright has continued to champion digital asset integration, having earlier authored a Bitcoin Rights bill that affirms citizens’ rights to transact in Bitcoin, prohibits central bank digital currency trials, and safeguards home-based crypto mining. However, Louisiana has not yet introduced legislation to establish a state-level Bitcoin reserve , a move other states are already pursuing. Neighbouring state Texas, for instance, recently passed Senate Bill 21, creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve managed by the state Comptroller, and it now awaits the governor’s approval . According to data from crypto legislation tracker Bitcoin Laws, at least 16 U.S. states were reviewing similar bills as of June 11.

2025-06-11T08:47:27,"Crypto Queen Senator Lummis Says Unfair Tax Laws Threaten Bitcoin","The post Crypto Queen Senator Lummis Says Unfair Tax Laws Threaten Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Senator Cynthia Lummis is on a mission to change the unfair crypto tax rules in the U.S. She believes that Bitcoin miners and DeFi users are getting a raw deal under the current system. Lummis says the tax rules are old and don’t work for the fast-growing world of digital assets. Let’s take a closer look at what’s going on and how this could change the game for crypto in America. Flawed Rules Target Crypto Investors Senator Lummis, known for championing crypto causes in Congress, says America’s tax system is too old for modern crypto businesses. She believes it’s stopping new ideas from growing and is hurting miners, who have to pay tax twice, once when they earn block rewards and again when they sell the coins. This double tax, Lummis argues, makes it hard for miners to make money and expand their businesses. But it’s not just miners who are struggling. DeFi users also worry because they might get taxed on every small transaction, even if they don’t make any real profit. Lummis says these unfair rules are holding crypto back, and it’s time to fix this. How Lummis Addresses This Problem To address these problems, Senator Cynthia Lummis is pushing Congress to use the reconciliation process. This method lets lawmakers pass changes quickly with a simple majority. Her mission is to narrow down the meaning of “broker” and remove extra rules that make it hard for crypto businesses to grow. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Admits DOGE Is ‘Here to Stay’ Despite Past Criticism , Senator Lummis has also introduced the BITCOIN Act , which aims to make Bitcoin a key part of the country’s financial plans. She said her office has already talked to the Senate Finance Committee to start these changes. Lawmakers Looking For Crypto Reforms Meanwhile, lawmakers in Washington are busy discussing a series of new crypto rules that could totally change how things work. This week, Congress is getting ready to vote on the GENIUS Act , while the CLARITY Act is also moving ahead.

2025-06-11T08:47:17,"Altcoins With Massive Gains and New ATHs as Bitcoin Flirts With $110K (Market Watch)","Bitcoin’s price attempted to take down the $110,000 level and perhaps head to a new all-time high once again hours ago, but it didn’t see much success. Many altcoins have posted mindblowing gains over the past 24-48 hours, led by Uniswap’s notable 16% surge and SPX’s 15% pump. BTC Flirts With New ATH The primary cryptocurrency experienced a substantial correction at the end of the past business week amid the public spat between US President Donald Trump and former ally Elon Musk. At the time, BTC plummeted to a multi-week low of under $100,500. Although some expected a breakdown to a five-digit price territory, the bulls stepped up and didn’t allow another decline. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover some ground and went back to $104,000-$106,000 during the weekend. The market started to pick up once the new business week began, and BTC shot above $110,500 on Tuesday for the first time in about 14 days . It was stopped there at first, but the bulls tried once again in the past 6 hours. However, to no avail so far, and BTC is back to just under $110,000. Here are the most vital support and resistance lines on the way to a fresh peak. For now, its market cap has remained sluggish at $2.180 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has been reduced to under 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView HYPE’s New ATH HYPE continues to be the rockstar of the altcoin space, registering frequent all-time highs. The latest came earlier today when the asset jumped to almost $43 after a double-digit surge. However, there are even bigger gainers over the past 24 hours, as UNI has soared by 16%, followed by SPX (15%), XDC (13%), OP (12%), A (12%), and ARB (11%). The top performers from the larger-cap altcoins include AAVE, BCH, LINK, SOL, and DOGE, with price increases of up to 7%. Ethereum soared to $2,800 earlier today but was stopped, while XRP continues to fight with the $2.3 resistance. The crypto market cap is up by almost $50 billion and now sits at $3.580 trillion.

2025-06-11T08:45:07,"Best crypto presales to buy as crypto reserve bill is introduced in Ukraine","The total crypto market capitalisation rose by 1% in the past 24 hours and is now up nearly 4% over the past week, reaching $3.45 trillion. This level marks a return to the consolidation zone seen a couple of weeks ago. The market’s current trajectory—a gradual, stepwise climb—suggests the next target could be the historical high near $3.7 trillion, assuming the prevailing positive sentiment holds. Unlike past bull runs fuelled by retail-driven FOMO, the latest rally is being shaped primarily by institutional and professional capital. As a result, the growth pattern resembles a measured ascent with frequent pauses rather than a parabolic surge. While less dramatic, this structure tends to be more sustainable and is often seen as more favourable for long-term holdings. As the broader market’s volatility declines and institutional adoption increases, top coins are looking less attractive to investors seeking outsized, asymmetric returns. That search for higher upside is driving renewed interest in early-stage tokens like Bitcoin Pepe , which are drawing risk-tolerant capital amid improving sentiment across the crypto market. As traders rotate into more speculative corners of the space, these high-volatility plays are emerging as key beneficiaries of the current momentum. Crypto reserve bill in Ukraine Ukrainian lawmakers have introduced a draft bill that could allow the country’s central bank to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in its official reserves. Tabled in the Verkhovna Rada on Tuesday, bill number 13356 proposes amendments to the existing law “On the National Bank of Ukraine,” expanding the list of permissible reserve assets to include crypto alongside traditional holdings like gold and foreign currencies. The legislation does not mandate crypto accumulation but grants the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) the authority to acquire digital assets such as Bitcoin at its own discretion. Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of parliament who confirmed the bill’s submission on Telegram, clarified that the central bank would retain full autonomy in deciding if, when, and how much crypto to hold in reserves. Bitcoin Pepe’s momentum remains strong Bitcoin’s sustained bullish momentum has lifted sentiment across the broader crypto market, setting the stage for conditions that have historically preceded wider rallies. In this risk-on environment, investors are again rotating into speculative plays, with meme coins among the early beneficiaries. Bitcoin Pepe is one such project gaining traction, drawing interest for its attempt to fuse viral internet culture with a serious Layer 2 blockchain proposition. Touted as one of 2025’s most closely watched crypto presales, Bitcoin Pepe has carved out a distinct identity with its ambition to “build Solana on Bitcoin”—a vision aimed at marrying Bitcoin’s network security with Solana-style scalability. Unlike many meme tokens that trade solely on hype, Bitcoin Pepe is anchored by a technical roadmap and infrastructure-driven narrative. The project has raised over $14 million in presale funding ahead of a planned listing announcement on June 17, underscoring strong investor appetite. As speculative capital continues to flow into early-stage assets, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself to capitalise on this momentum in the final stretch of its token sale.

2025-06-11T08:44:09,"Bitwise Announces Its Big Forecast for Bitcoin (BTC)! ""By the End of 2025…""","Even though the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is breaking new records, it is still considered to be below its fair value. At this point, Bitwise analysts André Dragosch and Ayush Tripathi finally explained the fair value of Bitcoin. Accordingly, analysts predict that Bitcoin could rise above $200,000 by the end of the year and reach its fair value of $230,000. Trump's proposed tax cuts and rising U.S. debt are the key drivers of the rally, analysts said, supporting Bitcoin's rise as a hedge against default risks. “Bitcoin’s scarcity and durability put it in a unique position to benefit from both financial instability and improving market sentiment. If these trends continue, the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin could end up shattering price expectations.” Analysts stated that Bitcoin fell to $100,000 with the tension between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, but recovered in a very short time, and said that the bull is solid and that it is a sign that the rise will continue. As a result, analysts have stated that they expect the rise to continue and rise to what they consider to be Bitcoin’s fair value of $230,000 by the end of 2025. Apart from Bitwise analysts, Bitwise CEO also announced his BTC price expectation. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley claimed that no one will sell when Bitcoin reaches $130,000-$150,000. In his post from the X account, Horsley said that if the Bitcoin price reaches $130,000-150,000, the current sales of investors who bought around $100,000 will stop. The famous CEO went a little further and said that when BTC reaches this level, investors who need liquidity will borrow money and invest in Bitcoin, which will push the price of Bitcoin even higher. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T08:32:21,"Make Money Fast: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Guarantees 233% Returns at Launch, 10X Potential Within First Year","In the crypto world, fortune favors the fast. Blink and you might miss the next opportunity to ride a wealth wave from ground floor to moon. Bitcoin did it. It minted over 100,000 millionaires during its early rise. But the game has changed. Today, the barriers to entry are higher, the competition stiffer, and the rewards harder to reach—unless you’re looking in the right place. Right now, that place is Bitcoin Solaris. Bitcoin Solaris: The New-Gen Wealth Machine Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is more than a coin—it’s a high-performance financial ecosystem built from the ground up to do what Bitcoin can no longer do: scale, reward, and include everyone. At its core is a dual-consensus architecture that combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) for rock-solid security with Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for scalability and speed. This allows BTC-S to process over 10,000 transactions per second with near-instant finality. The tech is reinforced by an energy-efficient design, mobile-first mining via the upcoming Solaris Nova App, and an ecosystem of smart contracts that opens the door to DeFi, real-world tokenization, and more. All of it is backed by security audits from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins . Why Bitcoin Solaris Will Make People Rich This isn’t just about technology. It’s about timing and access. Bitcoin Solaris opens the door to wealth creation in ways Bitcoin never could: The Solaris Nova App allows anyone to mine directly from their smartphone or laptop. Staking is flexible and DeFi-ready through a liquid system where staked BTC-S is converted to tradable sBTC-S, allowing users to earn while retaining control over their assets. Real-world use cases—DeFi, supply chain, gaming, healthcare—position BTC-S as a utility-first token, not a speculative gamble. The upcoming launch of the Solaris Nova App puts mining power in the hands of the many, not the few. It’s what Bitcoin could have been—if it launched in 2025. Staking Made Simple, Liquid, and Powerful Bitcoin Solaris introduces a next-gen staking system designed for both power users and beginners. Instead of locking funds, BTC-S allows you to stake and receive a tradable token, sBTC-S, at a 1:1 ratio. You earn rewards and retain full liquidity. Rewards without losing access to your assets Use sBTC-S in DeFi for lending, yield, or governance Staking integrated into the upcoming Solaris Nova App Automated validator delegation with no technical setup This system enhances decentralization and capital efficiency while making passive income more accessible than ever. A Smarter, Faster, Fairer Bitcoin Is Here—Step Into BTC-S Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: The Mining Difference Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Mining Device ASIC only Phones, laptops, desktops, ASICs Energy Use High 99.95% lower Block Time 10 min 5 sec (DPoS layer) Transaction Speed 7 TPS 100,000 TPS Accessibility Tech-savvy only Anyone, anywhere Rewards PoW only PoW + Staking + Validator incentives BTC-S is not trying to replace Bitcoin—it’s solving what Bitcoin left broken. Momentum Builds as Influencers Take Notice As momentum surges, so does public interest. Ben Crypto recently released a detailed review unpacking why Bitcoin Solaris is generating serious buzz. From smart contract capability to its wealth-generating potential, his video reflects what thousands of investors are realizing: BTC-S is a rare alignment of tech, timing, and traction. Presale Frenzy: Why Investors Are Scrambling In The Bitcoin Solaris presale is currently in Phase 7, priced at just $7—set to jump to $8 soon, with a launch price of $20. That’s a guaranteed 233% return baked into the timeline. But that’s only part of the story. Over 11,000 investors have already joined More than $4.1 million has been raised Less than 8 weeks remain before launch One of the shortest, most explosive presales in crypto history And with mobile mining expected to onboard thousands more users post-launch, the upward pressure is only beginning. You can explore the presale and join the BTC-S momentum at the official Bitcoin Solaris site . Behind the Scenes: A Scalable Engine So how does all this work under the hood? Dual-consensus architecture balances speed and security. Validator rotation every 24 hours ensures fairness. Rust-based smart contracts support real-world dApps with ultra-low fees. Zero-Knowledge Proofs add optional privacy for sensitive use cases. Up to 100,000 TPS ensures future-proof scalability. This is not just theory—it’s running on infrastructure backed by audited code and decades of blockchain evolution. Final Verdict: The Fastest Path to Crypto Gains? With an ecosystem that empowers miners, stakers, developers, and everyday users, Bitcoin Solaris feels like catching Bitcoin in 2011—but smarter. Its low entry price, high return potential, and inclusive design make it one of the rare projects that could deliver both short-term gains and long-term value. If you’re looking to make money fast—without sacrificing security or scalability—Bitcoin Solaris might be your clearest shot in 2025.

2025-06-11T08:31:31,"BTC ATH Within Reach: Glassnode Maps Support, Warns of Underpriced Volatility","Bitcoin (BTC) is once again knocking on the door of its all-time high (ATH), trading around $109,500 early Wednesday, a mere 2% shy of its $111,800 peak set nearly three weeks ago. Yet beneath the surface of this upward momentum lies a market defined by compressed volatility, long-term holder profit-taking, and a growing divergence between futures and on-chain sentiment. Long-Term Holders Cash In, But Supply Stays Sticky Glassnode’s latest Week On-Chain report outlines how BTC recovered from a local low of $100,400, where demand re-emerged after a brief but sharp 9% drawdown. According to the analytics platform, this dip rattled investor confidence, with the Fear and Greed Index momentarily entering “Fear” territory. However, the lack of mass panic selling, with only $200 million in on-chain losses realized, showed that capitulation was limited to the newest and most speculative market entrants. Despite the resilience, Glassnode warned of increased profit-taking activity among long-term holders (LTHs). The cohort locked in a peak of $930 million per day in realized profits, a level historically associated with overheated markets. Interestingly, this cycle seems to be defying tradition: despite the profit-taking, the proportion of Bitcoin wealth held by LTHs has increased. The report attributed this “unique market dynamic” to intense “maturation and accumulation pressures” overwhelming selling. A key driver appears to be the spot Bitcoin ETFs and institutional participation, effectively locking up supply in long-term custody and making LTH wealth “significantly stickier.” Indeed, on Monday alone, six out of eleven U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $386.2 million in inflows. These signals are also mirrored by recent data from CryptoQuant, which confirmed that U.S. buyers are reasserting dominance , with the Coinbase Premium index hitting a three-month high and the 90-day Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) flipping green for the first time in four months. Critical Levels for the Path Ahead Looking at the markets, at the time of this writing, BTC had posted an almost negligible uptick of 0.1% in the last 24 hours. Over the past seven days, the gains stand at 3.8%, with the asset up 5.3% for the month. Meanwhile, daily trading volume sits at $34 billion, with a circulating supply nearing 19.9 million BTC. With Bitcoin perched just below its ATH, the Glassnode report made clear the following technical and on-chain levels: Downside Support: The $97,600 short-term holders (STH) cost basis is the critical floor. Holding above it will maintain a bullish structure. However, a break below risks shifting sentiment. Furthermore, strong support lies around the 111 DMA ($92,900) and 200 DMA ($95,400). Upside Resistance: Breaking the ATH at $111,814 is the first hurdle. Beyond that, the next major on-chain resistance zone sits at $115,400. Additionally, sparse on-chain volume above current prices suggests a potential “air gap” exists, and if demand is strong enough, a swift move higher could occur once the ATH is surpassed. However, volatility remains a wildcard, with Glassnode warning of a dense cluster of coins acquired near the current price that could potentially amplify reactions to moves, even as options markets remain oddly subdued. At-the-money implied volatility (ATM IV) has yet to reflect these brewing tensions, potentially signaling underpriced risk.

2025-06-11T08:24:23,"Crypto Exchange Bullish Files for U.S. IPO as Digital Asset Enthusiasm Mounts: FT","Crypto exchange Bullish confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering, the Financial Times reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the situation. The company aims to capitalize on renewed enthusiasm for digital assets driven by pro-crypto policy signals from the Trump administration and follows last week's IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), whose shares soared 168% on the first day of trading. The FT did not distinguish between Bullish Exchange and its parent, Bullish Group, the Peter Thiel-backed company that is also the parent of CoinDesk. The confidential filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission allows Bullish to prepare for a public listing while keeping financial details private for now. Jefferies will serve as lead underwriter, according to the Financial Times. Bullish previously attempted to go public in a SPAC deal in 2021. The plan collapsed the following year amid market volatility. Bullish Exchange is a Gibraltar regulated trading platform. This time, the IPO filing comes as bitcoin trades around $110,000 and crypto sentiment strengthens amid favorable regulatory tailwinds following the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. The group is led by CEO Tom Farley, a former president of NYSE Group, and chaired by Brendan Blumer of Block.one. Thiel is a co-founder of PayPal (PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook, now Meta (META). Jefferies declined to comment to the FT. Bullish did not respond to the FT and had not responded to a CoinDesk request for comment by publication time.

2025-06-11T08:21:50,"Michael Saylor Predicts $1 Million Bitcoin Price, Says Crypto Winter Is Over","The post Michael Saylor Predicts $1 Million Bitcoin Price, Says Crypto Winter Is Over appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of MicroStrategy, has declared that the era of crypto winters is officially over . In a recent interview , he stated: “Winter is not coming back. If Bitcoin is not going to zero, it is going to $1 million.” This bold prediction comes amid growing support from the U.S. government , increasing institutional interest , and strong inflows into the Bitcoin ETF market . Saylor’s remarks have sparked fresh excitement across the cryptocurrency space. MicroStrategy Holds Over 582,000 BTC Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, is the largest public holder of Bitcoin, with 582,000 BTC , valued at over $63.7 billion . Other major public companies include: Marathon Digital – 49,179 BTC Riot Platforms – 19,225 BTC CleanSpark Inc – 12,502 BTC In total, public companies hold approximately 763,479 BTC , representing 3.636% of the total Bitcoin supply . Bitcoin Supply Remains Scarce Amid Daily Demand Currently, only around 450 BTC are mined each day (144 blocks/day * 3.125 BTC reward per block post- April 2024 halving ). Saylor pointed out that if institutional demand continues to absorb this daily supply, the Bitcoin price will inevitably rise . Institutional interest has surged, driven by U.S. regulatory support and a shift in political sentiment. On just one day, over $431.20 million flowed into Bitcoin Spot ETFs , and this month already saw 4 positive ETF inflow days out of 7. Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Gaining Global Attention Countries are also starting to recognize Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Recently, Pakistan announced plans to establish a national Bitcoin reserve —a major shift for a country that once rejected the digital economy. Meanwhile, the United States established its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on March 6, 2025. Currently, it holds confiscated BTC as a national asset. JAN3 Founder Samson Mow warned that Pakistan may front-run the U.S. in Bitcoin accumulation unless the U.S. acts quickly. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why MARA Stock Could Outperform Bitcoin in This Bull Market , Trump Administration Boosts Bitcoin Sentiment Saylor praised the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration , which has followed through on campaign promises by introducing favorable crypto policies. Key appointments include: Scott Bessent – U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul Atkins – New SEC Chair, replacing Gary Gensler These developments signal strong institutional and political tailwinds for Bitcoin’s continued growth.

2025-06-11T08:21:38,"Bitfinex Alpha | Bitcoin Tiến Gần Đến Bước Ngoặt Quan Trọng","Xem Full Báo Cáo Đăng ký trên BItfinex Một đợt tăng giá chuẩn sách giáo khoa của Bitcoin, được thúc đẩy bởi nhu cầu giao ngay mạnh mẽ, hoạt động chốt lời từ các nhà đầu tư dài hạn và sự gia tăng rủi ro vĩ mô, đã đưa tài sản này giảm hơn 10% so với mức cao nhất mọi thời đại (ATH). Đỉnh điểm của đợt giảm giá vào ngày 5 tháng 6 chứng kiến hơn 875 triệu đô la bị thanh lý vị thế long chỉ trong một ngày – minh chứng rõ ràng cho việc thị trường đang trải qua quá trình giảm đòn bẩy mạnh mẽ. Tổng cộng, hơn 1,9 tỷ đô la đã bị thanh lý trong tuần qua, giúp thị trường reset lại hệ thống đòn bẩy. Cấu trúc kỹ thuật cho thấy đợt tăng giá của BTC được hỗ trợ bởi nhu cầu thực tế, như biểu hiện qua chuỗi tăng giá từng nấc do giao dịch giao ngay dẫn dắt, với các vùng tích lũy quan trọng hình thành ở mức $93,000–96,000 và $102,000–104,000. Các chỉ báo trên chuỗi hiện đang phát tín hiệu về áp lực bán tăng lên khi các nhà đầu tư lâu năm bắt đầu phân phối tài sản. Chỉ số Phân Bố Nguồn Cung Đã Tiêu (SSD) và Dải Chi Phí Cơ Sở của Nhà Đầu Tư Ngắn Hạn (STH) vẽ ra lộ trình rõ ràng. Mức SSD 0,95 tại $103,700 đánh dấu vùng hỗ trợ đầu tiên, tiếp theo là $97,100 (Chi Phí Cơ Sở STH) và $95,600 (SSD 0,85), với $83,200 là mức rủi ro chính. Những mức này rất quan trọng vì chúng phản ánh các vùng chi phí cơ sở của các nhà đầu tư lớn và người mua gần đây, đóng vai trò là điểm tái nhập lệnh hoặc kích hoạt thanh lý tiềm năng. Tóm lại, Bitcoin hiện đang đứng trước ngã ba đường – cân bằng giữa hỗ trợ cơ bản và đà tăng giá suy yếu, chờ đợi cú hích vĩ mô tiếp theo. Khung cảnh kinh tế vĩ mô của Mỹ tiếp tục lộ ra nhiều điểm yếu khi tốc độ tăng trưởng việc làm trong tháng 5 chậm lại , phản ánh áp lực ban đầu từ căng thẳng thương mại và sự bất định về thuế quan. Mặc dù mức tăng lương vẫn ổn định, nhưng lực lượng lao động đang thu hẹp và các sửa đổi giảm xuống đối với dữ liệu việc làm trong quá khứ cho thấy khả năng chống chịu của thị trường lao động đang bắt đầu suy yếu. Đồng thời, cả ngành sản xuất và dịch vụ đều co lại , do chi phí đầu vào tăng cao và nhu cầu sụt giảm, nhấn mạnh tác động lan rộng của thuế quan đối với nền kinh tế. Chi tiêu xây dựng cũng giảm liên tiếp trong ba tháng, và áp lực lạm phát đang gia tăng khi doanh nghiệp gặp khó khăn trong việc hấp thụ chi phí tăng cao. Trên mặt trận thương mại, thâm hụt của Mỹ thu hẹp do nhập khẩu giảm – đặc biệt từ Trung Quốc – nhưng sự sụt giảm này phản ánh nhu cầu yếu hơn chứ không phải sức mạnh, gây lo ngại về tình trạng thiếu hàng tồn kho trong tương lai và lạm phát gia tăng. Trong khi đó, sự quan tâm của nhà đầu tư đối với trái phiếu dài hạn của Mỹ đang giảm sút, với dữ liệu đấu giá và thị trường tương lai chỉ ra sự hoài nghi về sự ổn định tài chính. Việc áp dụng tiền điện tử đang tăng tốc trên nhiều lĩnh vực, với IG Group trở thành công ty niêm yết đầu tiên tại Anh cung cấp giao dịch tiền điện tử giao ngay cho nhà đầu tư cá nhân. Thông qua hợp tác với Uphold, IG hiện cho phép mua trực tiếp bitcoin và các token khác, đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ các sản phẩm phái sinh mang tính đầu cơ sang quyền sở hữu tài sản thực tế. Động thái này trùng hợp với đề xuất của Cơ quan Quản Lý Tài Chính Anh (FCA) dỡ bỏ lệnh cấm đối với các ghi chú giao dịch trao đổi tiền điện tử (cETNs) dành cho nhà đầu tư cá nhân, báo hiệu sự hỗ trợ quy định rộng rãi hơn cho tài sản kỹ thuật số.

2025-06-11T07:40:50,"Why MARA Stock Could Outperform Bitcoin in This Bull Market","The post Why MARA Stock Could Outperform Bitcoin in This Bull Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many investors are keeping a close eye on MARA stock — the publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, Mara Holdings. While buying Bitcoin directly is one option, some prefer investing in Bitcoin mining stocks like MARA for several practical reasons, as explained by an analyst. Why Mining Stocks? Unlike holding Bitcoin, which requires managing private keys and digital wallets, mining stocks are traded like regular company shares on the stock market. This makes them easier for traditional investors to access. Plus, mining stocks come with fewer regulatory concerns compared to direct crypto investing and can even fit into retirement accounts. About Mara Holdings Founded in Florida in 2010, the company originally operated under the name Marathon Patent Group. It switched to Bitcoin mining in 2021 and later rebranded as Mara Holdings in 2024. Today, it’s one of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, known for using renewable energy and advanced cooling systems to run its operations. As of early 2025, Mara’s mining power reached over 54 exahashes per second — meaning its machines can make over 54 quintillion guesses per second while mining Bitcoin. In simple terms, it’s one of the fastest and most powerful mining setups out there. A Unique Bitcoin Strategy In mid-2024, MARA announced a full “HODL” strategy, deciding not to sell any of its mined Bitcoin to cover expenses. Instead, it started aggressively buying more Bitcoin from the market. To support this plan, MARA launched several stock offerings, including a massive $2 billion stock sale in March 2025. Thanks to this strategy, Mara has built up a huge Bitcoin reserve. In the first three months of 2025 alone, it mined 2,286 BTC, increasing its total holdings to over 48,100 BTC — the second-highest stash among public companies after Michael Saylor’s firm. The Bigger Picture Mara’s decision to hold onto its Bitcoin rather than sell it could significantly increase the company’s value, especially as Bitcoin’s price rises. Many other mining firms are now following a similar strategy, showing growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-11T07:25:11,"Analyst Makes Bold Claim: “Bitcoin Doesn’t Need the US, the US Needs Bitcoin” – Here’s Why","Cryptocurrency analyst Simeon Koch, in his latest analysis, drew attention to the strategic importance of Bitcoin for the economic and geopolitical future of the United States. According to Koch, Bitcoin has become indispensable not only for individual investors but also for the US government. Koch examined Donald Trump’s drastic change in attitude towards Bitcoin. Describing Bitcoin as a “valueless bubble” in 2019, Trump signed a decree in the White House declaring Bitcoin a “strategic state reserve” after his re-election in 2024. Koch argues that this change is not random but part of a deliberate plan. The economic part of this plan is that Trump’s family runs a crypto fund, invests in Bitcoin mining and makes millions with their own memecoins. But that’s not the real issue, Koch says. Alongside Trump, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also completely changed his view on Bitcoin over the years. While Fink once described Bitcoin as a “money laundering index,” he began to describe it as a “financial revolution” by 2023. Koch says that these changes in attitude are not so much about personal gain but rather an effort to maintain the US’s economic leadership. The US’s global supremacy is based on three pillars: the dollar being the global reserve currency, the high demand for US bonds and technological leadership. Bitcoin and crypto markets have the capacity to play a strategic role in all three of these areas. Since 2020, the US government debt has increased from $23 trillion to $36 trillion, while the money supply has increased from $1.8 trillion to $2.4 trillion. Koch says that this level of debt would have long ago bankrupted any other country, but the US has been able to carry the burden thanks to the dollar’s global position. Related News: Secret Bitcoin Activities of a Company Supported by Donald Trump in the US Have Been Revealed - Here Are the Details This is where the crypto market comes in. The stablecoin market is a huge liquidity pool with a size of around $250 billion. Large issuers like Tether back most of their reserves with US Treasury bonds. This gives the crypto sector an important role in indirect financing of US debt. Citing Standard Chartered’s analysis, Koch argues that the stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion by 2028, in which case stablecoin issuers alone would own 15% of U.S. bonds. According to Simeon Koch, Bitcoin and crypto markets in general have become not only an investment tool, but also a lifeline for the sustainability of the US economy. The shift towards crypto by both political and financial elites is not only due to individual interests, but also systemic needs. As a result, Koch says the U.S. needs Bitcoin more than ever to maintain its economic stability and global leadership: “This is no longer an option, it’s a necessity.” Just a few years ago, many US officials viewed the growing power of stablecoin issuers in the bond market as a threat to the national budget. But the picture has quickly changed. Today, the crypto industry is supported by regulatory frameworks and encouraged to grow, provided, of course, that major players like Tether and Circle remain loyal to the US and its dollar. To strengthen this connection, a new bill called the “GENIUS Act” is currently being discussed in the US Congress. According to the bill, stablecoin issuers will be required to back the majority of the digital assets they issue with US Treasury bonds. The idea behind this strategy is clear: The more bonds stablecoin companies buy, the more easily the US can finance its budget deficit. At the same time, the fact that these companies hold large amounts of dollar reserves allows excess liquidity to be drawn out of the system, giving the US Federal Reserve more leeway to stimulate the economy by printing new dollars. According to Koch, Trump and his team have a clear understanding that the crypto market is not only a “liquidity sponge” against inflation, but also a loyal buyer of US debt. Therefore, the government’s welcoming approach to the crypto market is a natural consequence of this conscious strategy. According to the analyst, Donald Trump’s goal of making the US a global crypto leader also fits perfectly with this equation. The stronger the blockchain, the more transactions are made in US dollars. This means more dollar reserves are drawn into the system. If the dollar’s dominance in the crypto market is maintained, the US could also offset potential losses in the petrodollar system. For decades, the dollar’s dominant role in oil trading has been a cornerstone of US economic dominance. Now, crypto has the potential to take on that role. But this new collaboration is a double-edged sword: the crypto market is both gaining more traction and demand, and increasing its reliance on US-centric monetary policies and bonds. According to Simeon Koch’s analysis, Trump’s call to “never sell your Bitcoin” stems not from a crypto belief, but from a cold-blooded geostrategic calculation. *This is not investment advice.

Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, has dismissed speculation that a new crypto winter is on the horizon, doubling down on his bullish Bitcoin outlook. Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday , Saylor stated, “Winter is not coming back. We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” His comments arrive amid a tightening Bitcoin supply and increased institutional interest. Saylor: Only 450 Bitcoin Mined Daily According to Saylor, just 450 BTC are available for sale each day from miners, amounting to roughly $50 million at Bitcoin’s current price of $109,859. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” he said, adding that public companies are now absorbing “the entire natural supply.” Strategy, which began accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, now holds 582,000 BTC—worth approximately $63.85 billion, according to Saylor Tracker. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn,” he noted. The billionaire also referenced broader market signals as validation for his aggressive forecast. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” Saylor said, pointing to traditional financial institutions preparing Bitcoin custody services and political support from key figures in Washington. BREAKING: BILLIONAIRE MICHAEL SAYLOR TELLS BLOOMBERG #BITCOIN IS GOING TO $1 MILLION AND THAT THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER CRYPTO WINTER COMPANIES AND ETFS ""ARE BUYING THE ENTIRE SUPPLY."" PARABOLIC SOON pic.twitter.com/Vv7qSRIgst — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) June 10, 2025 He cited President Donald Trump’s backing of Bitcoin, as well as support from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and SEC Chair Paul Atkins. “Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected,” Saylor said. Saylor did acknowledge potential volatility at higher price levels, stating that if Bitcoin rises to $500,000 or $1 million, it would be realistic to expect it “crashing down by about $200,000 a coin.” His remarks come as other major players revise their own projections upward. In April, ARK Invest raised its “bull case” price target for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. ETF Providers Continue to Accumulate Bitcoin Meanwhile, ETF providers such as BlackRock continue to purchase Bitcoin on a daily basis, and some governments are stepping in as well. On May 28, Pakistan’s crypto council head Bilal Bin Saqib announced plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Notably, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin continues to grow. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 116 public firms have now added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Recent additions include GameStop and Swedish health tech company H100. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

2025-06-11T07:07:29,"CONY: Earn Steady Monthly Income With This High Yielder","Summary CONY offers a high yield via monthly distributions, but its price has declined, leading to underperformance versus holding COIN directly. The ETF's distributions are classified as return of capital, offering tax deferral benefits until the fund is sold, which can appeal to long-term investors. Risks include declining distributions, potential for the fund price to approach zero, and uncertainty about sustaining high yields in the future. I rate CONY a 'hold'—it may be suitable for income-focused investors, but COIN offers higher total return potential for growth-oriented investors. This may not be for everyone, but the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) currently pays a 175% annual yield with distributions paid monthly. This fund can be a great way to collect monthly income with such a high yield. The fund doesn't invest directly in Coinbase ( COIN ). CONY generates income for distributions by writing (selling) call options on Coinbase. Since COIN tends to be a volatile stock, the premiums sold can be high from the elevated implied volatility of the call options. Some investors may prefer to do their own covered call strategy. However, CONY provides the convenience of having professionals manage those options regularly in exchange for a reasonable fee (expense ratio) of 1.22%. Investors of CONY buy the fund and then enjoy the high monthly distributions without much effort. The expense ratio looks reasonable considering the high annual yield that investors can derive from CONY. Understanding CONY's Performance Stock Performance of COIN vs. CONY (Weekly Chart) Including Dividends ( TradingView ) The weekly chart above shows the performance of COIN's stock price with a comparison to CONY's performance, including the distribution payouts. Even with CONY's generous monthly payouts, COIN still outperformed. The reason for this is because CONY's price declined significantly since inception. The YieldMax ETFs tend to underperform the underlying stocks that they derive income from. So, some investors may prefer to own COIN instead of CONY. In that scenario, COIN holders could sell some shares when income is needed. I will point out that Coinbase is currently in an uptrend on the weekly chart. This is indicated with the purple RSI line (middle of the chart) above the 50 level and the blue MACD line (bottom of the chart) above the red signal line. The MACD's green rising histogram bars also reinforce COIN's uptrend. Defenders of CONY may point out that they are happy with a lower total return with the consistent convenience of collecting monthly income from it. Defenders of holding COIN instead of CONY may say that they prefer the higher total return, especially when CONY's expense ratio adds to its total underperformance. The price of CONY declined over the long term since its inception. However, CONY's high yield allows investors to receive more in distributions than what they invested into it in a relatively short period of time. At the current yield, it would take less than a year. Therefore, CONY could lose all of its value and investors could still be profitable from the high distributions. Of course, this assumes that YieldMax is consistently successful with producing strong income. CONY's Tax Benefit Another plus for CONY is that the distributions are taxed differently than regular dividends. Since income from CONY is essentially options income, it is considered return of capital when paid out. The return of capital reduces the adjusted cost basis. According to IRS rules , return of capital is not taxed in the year that you receive the income. It would only be taxed when the ETF is sold. Therefore, a long-term holder of the fund could enjoy multiple years of income from CONY without being taxed on it if they choose not to sell. It is important to note that if the price of CONY went to zero, future distributions would be taxed in the year that you receive them. It is possible that the fund would do a reverse split if the price approached zero. This would allow the fund to continue and for YieldMax to continue paying distributions. Distribution Payout History CONY's Distribution Payout History (Seeking Alpha) We can see from the table above that 2025 was the first year that the monthly distributions dropped below $1 per share. This is relative to the price of CONY. For example, back on December 7, 2023, the distribution of $2.4615 was a monthly yield of 10.7% based on CONY's price on that day of $23.04. Recently, on May 29, 2025, the distribution of $0.7351 was a monthly yield of 9.5% based on CONY's price of $7.75 on that day. While the monthly yield did drop, it didn't drop as drastically as the percentage change of the distribution payout. Investors can purchase more shares as CONY's price drops, which can increase their monthly returns. That can include reinvesting some of the distributions to purchase more shares. Risks for CONY I realize that it sounds cliche, but there is no guarantee that future results will be similar to the past. It is possible that YieldMax is not able to produce high distributions going forward the way they did in the past. The implied volatility of the options sold could change, which could produce different results for distribution payouts. CONY's underlying price could continue to drop and approach zero. So, investors need to realize that the distributions are what can make them money from this ETF. YieldMax would probably do a reverse split to increase the price of CONY if it dropped too low. YieldMax did a reverse split on TSLY back in February 2024. It is also possible that the monthly distributions are lowered significantly, making the total annual yield less attractive. This could also significantly increase the amount of time that it would take for investors to make back their initial investment in distributions. Final Thoughts on CONY I see CONY fit for investors who desire steady monthly payouts. Personally, I would strive to get the highest return on my money as possible. That means that I would prefer to own COIN, which tends to have a higher total return even when CONY's dividends are accounted for. Those who prefer COIN should keep an eye on Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) bull markets. The reason for this is because COIN tends to trend similar to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's bear markets can be brutal, and the same is true for COIN. CONY began trading in 2023. So, it hasn't been around during Bitcoin's last halving cycle. It is possible that CONY's opposite, the YieldMax Short COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( FIAT ) would be better to own after Bitcoin and COIN peak this cycle. However, there is not much history to gauge how CONY and FIAT would perform during a Bitcoin bear market. Overall, I'll rate CONY a 'hold' since it can act as a feasible way for investors to collect income on a monthly basis. I won't give it a higher rating because CONY's success depends on the skills of the fund managers. Plus, there is not much history for this ETF since it is only a couple of years old.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793934-cony-earn-steady-monthly-income-with-this-high-yielder?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","COIN|CONY",cryptocompare

The new legislation has also barred the state government from creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The bill, H.B. 7082, published by the Connecticut General Assembly on Tuesday, was anonymously approved by both the state House of Representatives and the Senate, with no opposing votes. Further, the legislation has updated the state’s money transmission laws, with a major focus on crypto regulation. Crypto businesses engaging in money transmissions should disclose all material risks associated with crypto, the new law reads. NEW: Connecticut passes law to ban state investment in bitcoin. HB7082 prohibits the state from accepting, holding, or investing in any virtual currencies. It also imposes several new requirements on money transmitters. pic.twitter.com/lKozljMp1R — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 10, 2025 Connecticut’s legislative action is part of a broader effort to regulate state-level crypto activities and make sure that public funds are protected from the risks associated with these speculative investments. Additionally, the bill mandates legal guardian verification for users under the age of 18, imposing protections for minors. Connecticut Falls Out of Bitcoin Reserve Race Following months of strategic Bitcoin reserve proposals from 27 states, New Hampshire , Arizona , and Texas have approved state-level Bitcoin reserve law. For instance, Texas has a “significant budget surplus” and a strategic Bitcoin reserve in that state “offers a forward-thinking investment opportunity,” Lee Bratcher, President of The Texas Blockchain Council, told Cryptonews . “Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value aligns with our state’s history of making smart, diversified investments in emerging assets,” he said at the time. However, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation this year, joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. The hesitance to embrace BTC comes amid concerns over its price volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve , a significant move, but, didn’t have concrete details, failing to excite traders.

In a new video, trader Kevin Svenson tells his 83,200 YouTube followers that Bitcoin appears to be in the final stages of a parabolic trend that began in 2023. According to Svenson, Bitcoin could ignite a fresh leg up once it takes out its final resistance area at around $110,000. “It’s going to be a really epic next few months if we do get this breakout, because we are still following the parabolic trend to this day.” Svenson believes that a breakout will trigger a “blow-off top” for Bitcoin, where BTC will experience a period of rapid price increases before collapsing. “The next phase is the vertical phase, where you go into a potential blow-off top. A parabola is simply just an exponential trend and it gets steeper and steeper. And because of that, by definition, the parabolic trend it’s unsustainable… It’s a trade-off: it gets really, really bullish, and because of that, it’s unsustainable. Eventually, the trend just gives out just like Bitcoin in 2017, 2021. Eventually, the trend will shift back… But this next push could be until October.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will soar to $135,000 in the coming months.
