2025-06-11T17:47:38,"Pepe price due for a healthy pullback after 30% rally","Pepe has seen a sharp 30% rally after establishing a significant market low at the recent swing point. While momentum remains bullish, the memecoin is now approaching a major confluence of resistance that could prompt a temporary correction before further upside continuation. Pepe’s ( PEPE ) recent rally has been impressive, posting a clean 30% gain off a well-defined swing low. However, price is now testing a critical resistance cluster, which includes the point of control (POC), a high-timeframe horizontal resistance, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level from the previous decline. This area is technically significant and often associated with distribution or profit-taking zones. Key technical points 30% Rally from Swing Low: PEPE has rebounded strongly from a key support, marking a potential trend shift. Major Resistance Confluence Ahead: Price is now testing the POC, 0.618 Fibonacci, and high-timeframe resistance zone. Correction May Be Healthy: A rejection here would align with normal bullish structure, potentially forming a higher low. PEPEUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView From a technical perspective, the area PEPE is entering now acts as a natural resistance zone, where buyers may begin to slow down and profit-taking could emerge. This resistance band is reinforced by: The point of control, where the most volume has traded historically, A macro 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, a key reversal level in trending markets, And a high-timeframe horizontal resistance, which previously capped bullish momentum. Given the strength of the recent move, a pullback would be considered healthy, particularly if it results in a higher low forming near the last major breakout level. This would reinforce the current bullish structure and set the stage for a sustainable rally in the next leg up. You might also like: ADA, TON surge expose market weakness; BlockDAG’s X1 app sets new record with 1.5M users However, if the bullish momentum is particularly strong, there is still a chance PEPE breaks above this resistance cluster. In that case, bulls will need to push through the value area high, which would confirm a new swing high and shift the short-term outlook decisively in favor of continued upside. Until then, this region remains a critical decision zone where price must prove whether bulls are in full control, or if a rotation lower is required before the next leg. What to expect in the coming price action PEPE is now at a major crossroads. If bulls fail to break through the POC–0.618 resistance zone, a pullback toward high-timeframe support is the most likely outcome. This would allow for a healthy retest and potential higher low, keeping the uptrend intact. A breakout, however, would signal accelerating strength and continuation toward new highs.

This decision has helped calm global tensions and bring hope to the markets. Both countries agreed to return to the Pre-Liberation status quo . This means they will go back to the way things were before recent conflicts. Following this deal, the crypto market went up. Bitcoin (BTC) rose again to around $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) also grew strongly, reaching the $3,000 mark. US and China Reach Trade Deal Framework Talks that began on Monday led to an agreement by Wednesday, as officials from both the US and China confirmed they had found common ground. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the two countries had agreed on a basic framework that would begin once both presidents gave their final approval. He explained that the first step was to remove negativity so progress could follow. China’s Vice Minister of Commerce also said that both sides had settled on steps to implement the deal. Key parts of the agreement include China lifting limits on rare earth exports and the US easing some export bans. The deal will move forward once both Presidents review and approve it. Crypto Market Reacts Strongly The news of the truce sparked a strong reaction in the crypto market. The flagship crypto climbed higher , reaching near its all-time high. This price increase has sparked optimism among coin supporters with BTC up 2.2% to $109,572 On June 11, Strategy’s Chairman, Michael Saylor, said that the digital gold could reach the $1 million price mark, claiming the crypto winter is over. Ethereum increased by 5.5% in just 24 hours and is now trading at $2,772. Many traders believe it may soon cross the $3,000 level. Altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) coins also saw big gains. Some DeFi tokens recorded double-digit increases. If this trend continues, the total market value of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin, could rise from $857 billion to $1.7 trillion. Stock Market Also Shows Growth The optimism was not limited to cryptocurrencies. US stock markets also showed strong signs of growth. Dow futures grew by 100 points. Also, major stocks like Tesla rose 2.3% during pre-market trading on June 11. This strong crypto market response reflects investors’ renewed confidence in the crypto and financial market. The agreement between the U.S. and China is a major step toward better relations. It has already helped lift financial markets. If the president approves the deal soon, it could lead to further growth in crypto and stock markets.

On the day of the event, TRUMP’s total market cap stood at $3.13 billion. In the lead-up to the dinner, the token had experienced a consistent inflow of capital, largely driven by whales competing for top positions. As of press time on June 11, the market cap has declined to $2.12 billion, a loss of approximately $1.01 billion. This equates to an average daily drop of about $50.5 million over 20 days.

However, the meme coin appears to have lost momentum, failing to rally alongside recent bullish trends that pushed Bitcoin ( BTC ) past the $110,000 mark before a slight pullback. TRUMP’s performance Following the dinner announcement, TRUMP occasionally outperformed the broader crypto market, boosted by aggressive whale accumulation. To this end, some whales recorded massive profits and losses while trading TRUMP . The dinner was a reward for the top 220 TRUMP holders, who collectively spent over $100 million to secure seats.

2025-06-11T17:25:14,"Bitcoin w rezerwie USA, a Bitcoin Hyper przyspiesza jego rozwój","Stany Zjednoczone oficjalnie rozpoczęły budowę Rezerwy Strategicznej Bitcoina, a Bitcoin Hyper($HYPER) wspiera rozwój warstwy drugiej króla kryptowalut. Nowa struktura powstała z inicjatywy administracji Donalda Trumpa, która zdecydowała się wykorzystać skonfiskowane środki w celu zabezpieczenia cyfrowych aktywów. Ten ruch nie wynika z przypadku. Z danych udostępnionych przez Gemini i Glassnode wynika, że ponad 30% całkowitej podaży BTC znajduje się w rękach scentralizowanych podmiotów. Wśród nich są fundusze ETF, giełdy kryptowalut, przedsiębiorstwa oraz rządy. W raporcie podkreślono, że zaangażowanie instytucji publicznych może mieć istotny wpływ na rozwój rynku. Każdy dolar wprowadzony przez państwowy kapitał przekłada się na wzrost wartości rynkowej w wysokości 25 dolarów. Co więcej, generuje 1,70 dolara trwałego wzrostu wartości sieci. Tego typu wpływ sygnalizuje coraz większe znaczenie strategicznych rezerw w świecie cyfrowych aktywów. Nowy sygnał dla inwestorów długoterminowych Bitcoin przestaje być kojarzony wyłącznie z aktywem spekulacyjnym. Wzrost liczby zasobów przenoszonych z giełd do niezależnych depozytariuszy wskazuje na proces konsolidacji. Zmienność kursu uległa zmniejszeniu, co ułatwia planowanie inwestycji w dłuższym horyzoncie. Obecne cykle rynkowe nie przypominają już gwałtownych skoków i spadków. Sprawdź, jak kupić Bitcoina. Źródło: CoinMarketCap Zamiast tego charakteryzują się spokojniejszymi, bardziej stabilnymi wzrostami. Rezerwa Strategiczna działa nie tylko jako narzędzie ochrony wartości. Stanowi również dowód na to, że państwa zaczynają włączać kryptowaluty do swoich modeli zarządzania finansami. Dla inwestorów oznacza to zwiększoną pewność, a także nowe formy zaangażowania kapitału instytucjonalnego. Zjawisko to może wpłynąć na dalsze umacnianie pozycji Bitcoina w globalnym systemie finansowym. Bitcoin Hyper – nowa warstwa funkcjonalności Pomimo coraz większej akceptacji ze strony instytucji, główna sieć Bitcoina długo pozostawała ograniczona w zakresie możliwości technologicznych. Sytuacja ta zmienia się dzięki projektowi Bitcoin Hyper. W ciągu pięciu dni sprzedaż tokena $HYPER przekroczyła milion dolarów. Sprawdź też najlepsze kryptowaluty poniżej 1 dolara. To efekt rosnącego zapotrzebowania na rozwiązania, które rozszerzają funkcjonalność Bitcoina bez naruszania jego podstawowych zasad bezpieczeństwa. Bitcoin Hyper to druga warstwa Bitcoina zbudowana na maszynie wirtualnej Solany, która działa w połączeniu z bazową warstwą BTC. Taka konstrukcja pozwala uzyskać ponad 2 tysiące transakcji na sekundę, zachowując przy tym odporność na manipulacje oraz decentralizację. Użytkownicy mogą realizować szybkie przelewy, korzystać z aplikacji zdecentralizowanych, a także uczestniczyć w nowych formach aktywności, takich jak staking czy zdecentralizowany handel. Mechanizm działania sieci Bitcoin Hyper System opiera się na transparentnym modelu. Użytkownik deponuje BTC w inteligentnym kontrakcie, który weryfikuje transakcję na podstawie danych z łańcucha bloków. Następnie sieć emituje równoważny token, możliwy do wykorzystania w ekosystemie Bitcoin Hyper($HYPER) . Po zakończeniu aktywności użytkownik może spalić token i odzyskać oryginalne BTC. W tle działają dowody zerowej wiedzy oraz weryfikacja danych przez light clients. Użytkownik przesyła bitcoiny do inteligentnego kontraktu, który potwierdza transakcję na podstawie danych z sieci głównej. Po weryfikacji powstaje równoważny token w sieci Hyper, gotowy do dalszego wykorzystania. Kiedy użytkownik chce wycofać środki, token zostaje unieważniony, a oryginalne Bitcoiny wracają do właściciela. Cały proces odbywa się z użyciem zaawansowanych metod kryptograficznych, które zapewniają bezpieczeństwo i zgodność z głównym łańcuchem bez konieczności angażowania pośredników. Właściciele tokena $HYPER mogą korzystać z produktów o podwyższonym zwrocie, zyskać dostęp do zaawansowanych narzędzi oraz uczestniczyć w dalszym rozwoju projektu. Twórcy aplikacji mają szansę uzyskać dofinansowanie i zwroty kosztów opłat sieciowych, jeśli zdecydują się wykorzystywać $HYPER w swoich kontraktach. Dane z rynku potwierdzają skuteczność modelu Bitcoin Hyper Podobne projekty już wcześniej osiągały znaczące wyniki. Arbitrum zgromadziło ponad 13 miliardów dolarów wartości zablokowanej oraz ponad milion aktywnych portfeli. Sieć Base, powiązana z Coinbase, przekroczyła wartość 2,5 miliarda dolarów i notuje ponad milion aktywnych adresów dziennie. Dane te to dowód na to, że dobrze zaprojektowane sieci drugiej warstwy mogą szybko zdobywać rynek i użytkowników. Bitcoin Hyper ma potencjał, żeby powtórzyć ten sukces i stać się jedną z najlepszych przedsprzedaży kryptowalut . Całkowita podaż tokenów została ustalona na 21 miliardów, bez alokacji dla uprzywilejowanych grup. Obecnie trwa przedsprzedaż tokena $HYPER, a jeden z większych inwestorów nabył niedawno tokeny za równowartość 55 tysięcy dolarów. Tego rodzaju ruchy ze strony dużych graczy często prognozują większe zmiany. Nowa rola Bitcoina w cyfrowym świecie Rozwój Rezerwy Strategicznej oraz wdrożenie sieci Hyper to dwa bieguny tej samej zmiany. Z jednej strony widać instytucjonalizację zasobów cyfrowych. Z drugiej pojawiają się narzędzia, które poszerzają zakres ich użycia. Bitcoin przestaje pełnić jedynie funkcję przechowywania wartości. Staje się środowiskiem operacyjnym dla całych aplikacji, usług i produktów nowej generacji. Bitcoin Hyper wnosi do sieci Bitcoina funkcjonalność, której dotąd brakowało. Dzięki nowej warstwie technicznej możliwe stają się szybkie transakcje, obsługa aplikacji finansowych, zdecentralizowanych projektów i rozwiązań opartych na inteligentnych kontraktach. Sieć zyskuje skalę, której wymaga nowoczesna gospodarka cyfrowa. Bitcoin nie pełni już wyłącznie roli cyfrowego magazynu wartości. W połączeniu z Bitcoin Hyper przechodzi transformację w platformę operacyjną dla szerszego ekosystemu finansowego. Może wspierać codzienne zastosowania, przepływy kapitału, tworzenie nowych usług oraz rozwiązań dla użytkowników i firm.

2025-06-11T17:20:35,"Bitcoin is key to fighting inflation, says billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones","Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones believes the best defense against inflation is a portfolio composed of Bitcoin, gold, and equities. In an interview with Bloomberg, the founder of Tudor Investment Corp. described this mix, adjusted for volatility, as the ideal hedge in what he sees as a persistently inflationary era. Jones said policymakers will likely continue to run “hot” economies by keeping real interest rates below inflation to manage mounting debt.

He also warned that such policies only work “until the population throws you out,” referencing similar dynamics in Japan. In that environment, Jones explained, assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold become critical as stores of value. While he previously advocated for a 1–2% Bitcoin allocation, Jones now emphasizes the broader case for owning the digital asset, though he declined to cite a specific percentage. Given Bitcoin’s higher volatility compared to gold, Jones recommended adjusting allocations accordingly. “That’s probably your best portfolio to fight inflation,” he said. Jones also speculated that, if re-elected, President Trump would appoint an “uber-dovish” Federal Reserve chair after Jerome Powell’s term ends, potentially accelerating these inflationary dynamics.

2025-06-11T17:20:20,"BitFuFu: Q1 Was A Strategic Reset, But Hashrate Rebound Signals A Stronger Q2 Ahead","Summary BitFuFu faced a sharp Q1 revenue and capacity decline, but operational recovery and hashrate expansion post-Q1 signal a positive turnaround. Cloud mining remains BitFuFu’s dominant revenue source, with registered users nearly doubling YoY to over 607,000 users, signaling growing retail demand despite infrastructure lag. BitFuFu's close ties with BITMAIN offer hardware procurement advantages but pose related-party and concentration risks, though liquidity remains healthy for now. Despite recent setbacks, BitFuFu’s infrastructure recovery, improving efficiency, and growth in cloud user base, point to a stronger Q2 and support my continued Buy rating for FUFU shares. BitFuFu (NASDAQ: FUFU ) is one of the new entrant publicly traded Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining companies in the current crypto market cycle. BitFuFu has grown in popularity since going public in March last year thanks to the company’s cloud mining segment, which makes Bitcoin mining more accessible to a larger audience. The company is headquartered in Singapore and has close ties with Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing giant BITMAIN. The founder and CEO of the company, Leo Lu, commands extensive experience in the crypto mining business, having headed the cloud mining division at BITMAIN for several years before going on to found BitFuFu in December 2020. Several other key members of BitFuFu’s team were former members of BITMAIN and Bitdeer ( BTDR ). BitFuFu’s long-standing relationship with BITMAIN gives an edge in securing cutting-edge mining hardware, but it also poses potential related party risks (which I’ll discuss down the line in this article). BitFuFu's operational and financial performance last year was impressive. FY24 was both an operational breakout year and an inflection point for BitFuFu, with revenue surging by 63.1% compared to FY23 and net income skyrocketing 414.3% compared to FY23. Revenue for the full-year FY24 was $463.3 million and net income was $54 million. I covered the FY24 earnings review in a previous article published here on Seeking Alpha in March this year. Reference to FY24 is necessary for an insight into the Q1 FY25 earnings and the outlook for the remaining quarters of FY25. BitFuFu Q1 FY25 results were announced last week. It was a mix of positives and negatives, with headwinds impacting top-line performance, yet underlying operational trends suggest that the company might be undergoing strategic adaptation and still showing ongoing resilience despite the headwinds faced. Virtually every miner that has reported earnings so far in 2025 has experienced headwinds that are cutting across the board. A first peek at BitFuFu’s Q1 results might suggest that FY25 is shaping up so far to be quite not like FY24. Since tariffs and macroeconomic shifts, the crypto market has been grappling with volatility. But putting volatility and Bitcoin price aside, let’s examine BitFuFu’s Q1 operational performance so far this year in this piece. FUFU has been on a nosedive since the start of the year. And on the heels of the Q1 results, the pressing question for investors is whether FUFU still presents a compelling investment opportunity in Bitcoin mining. Data by YCharts What BitFuFu FY25 Is Shaping Up To Be BitFuFu’s Q1 results must have been an unwelcome surprise for most investors following last year's stellar financial performance. The YoY decline was pronounced across the board. BitFuFu saw revenue decline in Q1 by 46% YoY. Revenue fell from $144.4 million in the same period last year to $78 million in Q1. Net loss was $16.9 million, compared to net income of $35.3 million in Q1 FY24. A breakdown of revenue shows cloud mining still holds a dominant position in the company’s operations at 68.8% of total revenue in Q1. Self-mining accounted for 22.5%, while the sale of mining equipment and other segments contributed about 8.7% of total revenue. Growth on the cloud mining side shows nearly a 100% increase in the past year, with the number of registered users growing from ~321,000 users in Q1 last year to over 607,000 users in Q1 this year. The growth in registered cloud mining users did not offset the revenue decline, though. BitFuFu attributed the decrease in financial performance to several factors, including last year's April Bitcoin halving event, an increase in blockchain network difficulty (as a result of the halving), and the temporary decrease in the company's hashrate under management in Q1. I think some of the justifications from management for the decrease in financial numbers are somewhat debatable. The halving event was over a year ago, and miners have ramped up capacity to compensate for the reduced block rewards. Moreover, the Bitcoin price has increased nearly 70% since the halving. The ~70% increase in the value of each Bitcoin mined is more than substantial enough to greatly offset, if not entirely negate, the impact of halved block rewards. I, therefore, believe that still blaming the halving in Q1 2025 is much about an attempt at deflection. I’d focus on operational factors as the main cause of BitFuFu's production and financial decline in Q1. I believe the decline in BitFuFu’s mining capacity (hashrate) and electricity capacity in Q1 (as reported by the company) were the main driving factors responsible for the decline in Bitcoin production and revenue in Q1. Operational metrics (BitFuFu form 6-K) While BitFuFu nearly doubled its cloud mining users compared to Q1 last year, the growth came at a time when total hashrate and power capacity declined sharply. This result is a telling disconnect between demand and supply. Without the infrastructure to match rising demand, revenue per user likely fell, which explains why cloud mining’s dominant share of revenue (68.8%) wasn’t enough to prevent the steep top-line decline. BitFuFu’s power capacity declined from 644 MW to 478 MW YoY, which was a 26% decline. Hashrate under management declined by 28% from 28.6 EH/s in Q1 FY24 to 20.6 EH/s in Q1 this year. Sequentially, their hashrate under management also decreased by 12.3% from 23.5 EH/s in Q4 FY4 to 20.6 EH/s in Q1 FY25, while power capacity declined sequentially by 13.3% from Q4 FY24 to Q1 FY25. I’ve pointed out the sequential capacity contraction to show that BitFuFu’s operational capacity contraction is more than just a seasonal or cyclical variation but rather reflects an ongoing operational slowdown. Moving beyond Q1, there has been some turnaround in the capacity drop at BitFuFu which was caused by expired hashrate procurement contracts, and disruptions from supplier miner fleet relocations and upgrades in Q1. BitFuFu has reported a strong recovery in capacity post-Q1, with hashrate rebounding to 28.3 EH/s as of April 30 , driven by expanded supplier partnerships and increased hash power procurement; power capacity also increased to 566 MW in April. Hashrate further increased by 20.5% to 34.1 EH/s as of May 31, while power capacity increased another 15% sequentially from April’s 566 MW to 651 MW as of May 31. Notably, much of the hashrate added is from the latest generation Antminer S21 miners deployed in May, translating to more efficiency in improving cost structure per BTC produced and maintaining competitiveness against rising mining difficulty. BitFuFu recorded an average fleet efficiency of 19.1 J/Th in May. A breakdown of BitFuFu’s hashrate composition in May tells more about BitFuFu’s asset-light ongoing business model and why reduced capacity in some quarters might be a necessary adjustment as cloud demand outstrips supply and vice versa. Of the 34.1 EH/s hashrate under management in May, 29.9 EH/s of the hashrate were from third-party hosts, while 4.2 EH/s were from its own facilities. It’s worth mentioning that the hashrate from third-party can be used flexibly by BitFuFu for both self-mining and cloud-mining services as overall demand dictates. BitFuFu’s liquidity doesn’t present an immediate concern, considering the drop in capacity and sales already discussed so far. Besides, the company has invested heavily in acquisition and expansion in the past year. BitFuFu’s BTC in treasury increased by 71.2% to 1,835 BTC as of Q1, compared to 1,072 BTC as of Q1 last year. As of May 31 (which is the latest update), BitFuFu held 1,709 BTC, a decrease of 199 BTC from figures reported in the April operations update . I think it is notable to have maintained a substantial increase in BTC held in treasury YoY despite needing to fund operational needs, strategic investments, and working capital requirements, especially during net loss quarters. BitFuFu has had two net loss quarters since Q1 last year — one in Q3 FY24, and the other is the latest in Q1 FY25. Balance sheet [$ ’000] (BitFuFu form 6-K) The balance sheet further paints a picture of a company that is actively expanding and navigating the headwinds that come with the Bitcoin mining business. On the balance sheet, we see notable growth in equipment, showing ongoing infrastructure build-out in Q1 despite the near-term capacity contraction, which further suggests that new hashrate and energy deployments were possibly delayed to later quarters or pending external infrastructure readiness. One line item that raises my eyebrow in the Q1 balance sheet is the sequential high surge in the amount due to related parties, which increased 880% from $1.6 million in Q4 last year to $15.5 million in Q1 this year. Remember, in the brief overview in the intro of this piece, I mentioned BitFuFu’s close ties with mining hardware giant BITMAIN. Some aspects of these ties are financial in nature, and BitFuFu also maintains some operational and service-related dependencies on BITMAIN, and this poses some potential concentration risks, particularly in times of liquidity strain. In BitFuFu’s latest form 20-F filing , BITMAIN is named as “a related party to a shareholder of the Company,” confirming the indirect but material connection, and translates to financial leverage or obligations likely not easily controllable by BitFuFu. We also rely on Bitmain to provide the miner hosting services under certain hosting service cooperation arrangements, through which Bitmain sources a limited number of hosting facilities to host miners and provide services related to maintenance and technical support, electricity, network, and security. These hosting facilities may demand upward adjustments of their service fees, including electricity costs, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. We cannot assure you that it can continue to maintain cooperation with these hosting facilities, or the services provided by these parties always meet the level of quality, efficiency, and timeliness necessary for us to render satisfactory hosting services to our customers. Such hosting facilities may experience interruption or other incidents from time to time and may be unable to provide services to us. We may not be able to obtain alternative hosting facility supplies in a timely manner and/or at commercially viable terms. If we are unable to effectively address these risks, our ability to serve customers will be affected, and our brand image, reputation, and financial performance may be materially and adversely affected. - Excerpt from BitFuFu Form 20-F Related parties transactions [$ ’000] (BitFuFu form 20-F) I’m highlighting these close ties because it is one of the main risks I associate with BitFuFu apart from the broader industry risks associated with Bitcoin mining in general — the risk of constrained negotiations in a business line where favorable terms and flexibility are very crucial. As of Q1, debt to related parties hasn’t posed an immediate risk, as BitFuFu still has enough liquidity to manage obligations. The quick ratio and current ratio in Q1 were 2.3 and 3.03 respectively. BitFuFu is one of the miners that least taps into equity fundraising. Investors have enjoyed a largely undiluted share structure since FUFU went public. Yesterday, BitFuFu announced a new funding plan to raise $150 million through an ATM offering. Investors should watch out for dilution in the near term. How BitFuFu Stack Up to Peers Price-to-Hodl peer comparison (Author) When comparing miners based on how much investors are paying for each dollar of Bitcoin held in treasury, BitFuFu sits in mid-tier at 3.09x Price/HODL. This makes sense as BitFuFu does not pursue a full HODL strategy but liquidates some produced BTC to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives. I believe BitFuFu’s P/HODL is more likely to shrink in the near-to-mid term, and FUFU becoming more attractive if the miner continues to emphasize operational growth, as we've seen with hashrate and power capacity turnaround and the acquisition of the 51 MW data center facility in Oklahoma in Q1 among other growth initiatives. Also, BitFuFu’s balance sheet isn’t so strained that it will need so much ongoing divesting of BTC produced in self-mining. Data by YCharts BitFuFu’s P/S (TTM) at 1.51x remains attractive among mining peers despite the drop in revenue in Q1. Last year’s strength in sales still supports the P/S ratio on a TTM basis. As we have analyzed the factors that influenced the drop in revenue in Q1, BitFuFu’s latest reported 34.1 EH/s (which already surpasses the hashrate guidance for the full year 2025 of 33 EH/s) and recovery of power capacity signals an upside setup for Q2 and a potentially lower P/S when Q2 results are announced, prompting a rerating of the metric if Bitcoin also maintains its current momentum. Despite the headwinds, I’m reiterating a Buy for FUFU here on the operational recovery post-Q1 and the ongoing growth prospects the operational recovery presents.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794137-bitfufu-q1-was-a-strategic-reset-but-hashrate-rebound-signals-a-stronger-q2-ahead?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","BTC-USD|BTDR|FUFUW|FUFU",cryptocompare

The DOJ alleges New York resident Iurii Gugnin used his crypto company, Evita, to move dirty money through the US for sanctioned Russian banks, which helped Russian individuals acquire sensitive US technology. Gugnin, who also goes by the names Iurii Mashukov and George Goognin, allegedly had foreign customers who held assets in sanctioned Russian banks pay him in the top stablecoin, Tether’s USDT . The DOJ says the crypto executive would then launder the USDT through digital asset wallets and US bank accounts, eventually converting it into dollars or other fiat currencies. He then allegedly made payments through bank accounts in Manhattan on behalf of his foreign customers, obscuring the source of the funds and defrauding banks and exchanges in the process. Gugnin, 38, was arrested in New York on Monday and charged with wire and bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering compliance program, failing to file suspicious activity reports, money laundering and related conspiracy charges.

This trust-minimized protocol transforms Bitcoin into functional DeFi capital while preserving full user custody. tBTC is now available for direct minting on Starknet via the Threshold UI, allowing users to seamlessly bring native BTC onchain without custodians or intermediaries. With Bitcoin’s average transaction fee at $1.49 ( 7-day moving average, June 2025 ), it’s no match for Starknet’s ultra-low costs, where the same Bitcoin, via tBTC, can be traded, lent, or deployed in complex DeFi strategies for just $0.01 per transaction. “BTC on Bitcoin Mainnet is like gold bars in a vault: valuable but unusable,” said MacLane Wilkison, Co-Founder of Threshold Labs. “At just $0.01 per transaction on Starknet, Bitcoin becomes more than a store of value — it can now be used for small to large-scale trades, executed hundreds of times a day, and as a source of capital to lend or even borrow against. This is Bitcoin as it was meant to be used.” The Numbers: Why Bitcoin DeFi Struggles Current Bitcoin mainnet reality (June 2025 data): Average transaction fee: $1.49 (7-day moving average) Recent peak during congestion: $91.89 (April 2024) Confirmation time: 10-60 minutes Result : Complex DeFi operations become uneconomical: even at $1.49, a $100 trade costs 1.5% in fees. tBTC on Starknet changes the economics: Transaction fees: $0.01 Confirmation: Instant Throughput: 857 TPS (achieved in testing) Result: Bitcoin becomes a working capital, operating at minimal cost. What’s Coming Next for tBTC x Starknet With the launch of tBTC on Starknet, Threshold Network is building the foundation for a Bitcoin-Ethereum economy within a scalable, zero-knowledge environment. tBTC is integrating with Starknet’s most prominent protocols to bring trust-minimized Bitcoin liquidity to trading, borrowing, and beyond. Live on Launch: DEX Trading on Ekubo – Native Starknet DEXs enable deep, efficient trading of tBTC against select pairs. Users can deploy capital with minimal slippage and explore high-frequency strategies at a much lower cost. Coming Soon: tBTC Lending on Vesu – Soon, users can borrow against their tBTC positions without relinquishing custody, via Vesu. This integration mirrors the success of tBTC on Ethereum, where over 25% of the supply is locked in Aave. What Can Users Do with tBTC on Starknet Execute on Select Trading and Borrowing Strategies Provide liquidity at minimal rebalancing costs Use Bitcoin as collateral without selling Manage positions freely on DEXs Trade tBTC or explore staking pairs Enabling New Application Use Cases: Streaming Payments: Enables Bitcoin-backed payments to be sent on a per-second basis. Automated Strategies: Allows BTC to function within smart contract systems while minimizing gas overheads that could reduce returns. Bitcoin-Powered Gaming: Facilitates microtransactions through low-cost, instant Bitcoin-backed transfers, making them viable in gaming environments. What’s Coming Next Perpetuals & CDPs: Upcoming integrations with perp DEXs and collateralized debt protocols will expand risk-managed leverage options and allow BTC to power more complex DeFi tools. Yield Vaults: Future integrations with automated vaults will simplify liquidity management for users and unlock more opportunities with BTC on DeFi. Oracles & Liquidity Infrastructure: Collaborations with major liquidity providers and oracle networks will ensure accurate price feeds and optimal capital deployment. “This fundamentally changes Bitcoin’s role in DeFi,” said Damian Chen, Head of Growth at the Starknet Foundation. “We’re seeing developers revisit ideas killed by high fees. Bitcoin at scale is finally possible on Starknet.” Security Without Compromise Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins that require corporate custody, tBTC uses threshold cryptography. Multiple independent nodes secure Bitcoin deposits, ensuring that no single entity controls funds. No KYC is required, and users maintain Bitcoin sovereignty while accessing DeFi. Starknet’s zero-knowledge proofs provide the scaling. STARK cryptography compresses thousands of transactions into one proof, achieving 857 TPS in testing while maintaining Ethereum’s security guarantees. How to Access tBTC on Starknet Access tBTC on Starknet via 2 ways: Direct Minting from BTC to tBTC (Starknet): https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint Bridge tBTC from Ethereum L1 to Starknet: https://starkgate.starknet.io/ethereum/bridge?mode=deposit With $547 million in TVL , 193 active protocols , and over 11,000 daily users , Starknet has rapidly emerged as a hub for scalable, composable DeFi. Starknet users can now directly mint tBTC — a fully backed, 1:1 representation of native Bitcoin — through the Threshold UI, providing them with seamless access to Bitcoin’s value without intermediaries and with full self-custody. Additionally, users can bridge existing tBTC from Ethereum L1 to Starknet via the official StarkGate bridge, offering even more flexibility for Bitcoin holders to participate in Starknet DeFi. Market Context Despite a $2.1 trillion market cap, Bitcoin’s presence in DeFi remains minimal, with just $6.3 billion (under 0.3%) locked in decentralized protocols, according to DefiLlama data from June 2025. As transaction costs decline and access barriers are removed, the Bitcoin DeFi market has the potential to grow 10–15x, unlocking new utility beyond passive holding and into active, composable participation across DeFi. tBTC has operated since 2020 as the leading trust-minimized Bitcoin protocol. Combined with Starknet’s proven 857 TPS capacity, Bitcoin DeFi can finally scale. About Threshold Network Threshold Network powers tBTC, the leading decentralized, 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset for DeFi. Secured by a 51-of-100 threshold signer model, tBTC enables BTC to move across multiple chains—including Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, and BOB—without requiring custodians or compromising security. With $450M+ in TVL and $3.6B in bridge volume since 2020, Threshold delivers the most robust trust-minimized Bitcoin infrastructure in DeFi. About Starknet Starknet is a permissionless, decentralized zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup that offers high scalability, low fees, and fast finality. Powered by STARK proofs and developed by StarkWare, Starknet is designed for long-term composability, security, and developer flexibility.

2025-06-11T16:37:05,"Bitcoin tests resistance near ATH as analysts eye $120K, KAIA leads altcoins","Bitcoin bulls attempted to break past all time highs today as momentum returned across the market amid bullish developments on the macro front. Crypto bulls found fresh footing as the market’s total capitalisation soared past $2.6 trillion, snapping back to highs last seen in late May. Meanwhile, the Fear & Greed Index spiked seven points to 64, capturing a decisive turn in sentiment towards ‘greed’ levels. With global risk appetite on the rise, traders appear to be chasing momentum across majors and altcoins alike. Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin’s latest surge comes on the heels of growing optimism that the U.S. and China are nearing the end of their long-standing trade standoff, a geopolitical development that has historically influenced broader market sentiment. A statement from U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social confirmed that a trade agreement is “done,” pending final approval with Chinese President Xi Jinping. One of the key pressure points, rare earth exports, now appears less volatile, with both sides signalling a de-escalation. Although equity futures responded cautiously, digital assets reacted more decisively. For crypto markets, the prospect of reduced geopolitical friction translates to diminished systemic risk, opening the door for renewed capital inflows. Easing trade hostilities sets the stage for a more supportive macro environment. That’s particularly bullish for Bitcoin, which remains highly sensitive to shifts in liquidity and investor risk appetite. As a hybrid asset that straddles the line between speculative growth and macro hedge, Bitcoin has responded sharply to this potential turning point in global policy dynamics. The prospect of a U.S.–China trade resolution is prompting investors to rotate capital back into risk assets, with many expecting dormant institutional flows to re-enter the market. With fears of escalation receding, Bitcoin is regaining its appeal as a high-conviction bet on reflation, policy flexibility, and long-term digital asset adoption. The momentum was further reinforced by remarks from China’s Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang, who confirmed that the two countries had reached an “in-principle agreement” and engaged in “candid and in-depth” talks during negotiations in London. This adds credibility to Trump’s remarks and signals a coordinated effort toward finalizing the deal. For crypto markets, the timing is critical. The rally aligns with broader risk-on signals in global markets, rising open interest in Bitcoin futures, and strengthening fundamentals. With macro headwinds softening and sentiment improving rapidly, Bitcoin may be entering a new phase of price discovery. Will Bitcoin rise again? Market analysts appear increasingly confident that Bitcoin is on the verge of reclaiming its all-time high, with several pointing to a technical setup that suggests price acceleration is near. At the time of writing, BTC was trading just less than 2% below its all-time high of over $111,000, testing key resistance amid growing bullish momentum. Popular analyst Jelle noted that Bitcoin’s monthly chart “looks ready for acceleration,” suggesting the market may be gearing up for a sustained breakout. He expects an immediate rally towards $120,000 if the $108,000 level flips into support, with the possibility of a cycle top forming around $140,000 to $150,000. A similar sentiment was echoed by MN Capital’s Michael van de Poppe, who argued that the recent break above $106,500 triggered the current rally. He believes that another push above $110,500 could set the stage for fresh all-time highs, although some short-term consolidation may be required before that happens. “The first period of consolidation typically lasts a few days. Then, we’re going to have the next breakout above the ATH,” Poppe said in a recent X post. On-chain data further supports the bullish thesis. The BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap on Binance shows a dense concentration of leveraged positions near the $112,000 mark, a level now acting as both resistance and a potential catalyst.

Some pointed to a recent breakout above a descending wedge structure on the daily chart, a pattern often associated with confirmation of bullish reversals. BTC/USDT 1-day price chart. Source: CryptoJack . Altcoins see renewed momentum With macro headwinds easing and risk appetite on the rise, altcoins are beginning to gain traction which some analysts are viewing as the early signal of an incoming altcoin season. Historically, new Bitcoin all-time highs are often followed by capital flowing into altcoins, and several metrics now point to a similar rotation underway. Bitcoin dominance remains elevated at 64–65%, yet the Altcoin Season Index has quietly climbed into the low 30s, a subtle but telling sign that investors are beginning to broaden their exposure. With risk sentiment improving, traders appear more willing to rotate into altcoins in search of higher upside. Pseudonymous analyst Moustache pointed to an ascending broadening wedge forming on altcoin dominance charts, now approaching a key breakdown level. He noted that a similar structure preceded a strong altcoin rally in November. Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap rose nearly 3% to $1.4 trillion at the time of writing. Ethereum, the leading altcoin by market cap, rose 3.5% over the day, trading at $2,840, its highest level seen since February 24, while other large-cap altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) recorded gains ranging between 1-5% while Tron (TRX) being an exception dipping 1% over the period. Kaia (KAIA) stood as the leading gainer of the day among the top 99 altcoins with gains of 23.3%, while SPX6900 (SPX) and Jito (JTO) followed, holding on to gains of 18.8% and 13.3% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap KAIA’s gains today came as excitement grew around its plan to launch a South Korean won–based stablecoin following its recent launch of native USDT on Kaia Chain. Some of the momentum was also fuelled by news of a potential partnership with Japanese messaging giant LINE. SPX6900 hit a new all-time high of $1.62, supported by an uptick in whale accumulation, and the broader shift in market sentiment triggered by Bitcoin’s rebound. Similarly, Jito rallied with no particular catalyst driving the move apart from broader market momentum.

2025-06-11T16:23:22,"Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB, TREAT, BONE & LEASH All Upgraded – Can This Supercharge the Burn and Trigger a 10x?","The Shiba Inu price (SHIB) is quietly defying the broader crypto slump today, rising 4.5% even as the market dips by 1.5%. While still modestly up 5% over the past week, SHIB has been bruised by a 23% monthly drop and remains 40% down from a year ago—yet today’s outperformance could signal early momentum for a rebound. Notably, the Shiba Inu protocol has just introduced several upgrades which make SHIB and its ecosystem tokens – TREAT, BONE and LEASH – more efficient and attractive to use. And when combined with other recent and upcoming improvements, these changes help boost the case for a bullish long-term Shiba Inu price prediction . Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB, TREAT, BONE & LEASH All Upgraded – Can This Supercharge the Burn and Trigger a 10x? Posting on X, Shiba Inu team member Lucie unpacked just how the latest upgrades improve the overall experience for SHIB token users. SHIB DEFI TOOLKIT JUST LEVELED UP SHIB | BONE | LEASH | TREAT — things just got serious. This isn’t a cosmetic refresh. It’s a total upgrade to the engine that powers how you earn, trade, and burn inside the ecosystem. 1. Precision Liquidity Pools Are Live •LPs can… pic.twitter.com/sFaDIddPyC — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) June 9, 2025 Some of the main improvements include more efficient staking, precision liquidity pools, auto burns triggered by trading activity (e.g. swaps, liquidity actions), and a streamlining of trading interfaces. This all conspires to make the Shiba Inu ecosystem more attractive to seasoned traders, which in turn should boost demand for SHIB and its related tokens. The deployment of these upgrades is arguably part of the reason why the Shiba Inu price has done well today, outperforming the market average. And if we look at its chart, we see that it has begun regaining momentum after a period of decline that began in the middle of May. Its RSI (purple) has jumped up to 50 after plunging to 30 a week ago, while its 30-day average (orange) has bottomed out in relation to the 200-day (blue), suggesting that a big rebound is coming. Source: TradingView Given that SHIB is still 84% down on its ATH of $0.00008616 (set in October 2021), there’s arguably lots of room for the token to continue rising without entering a dangerously overbought region. And if the market continues its gradual improvement of the past few weeks, we could see the Shiba Inu price reach $0.000020 at some point next month. In combination with recent upgrades, upcoming launches, such as that of ShibOS, could also help it reach $0.000050 by Q4. The Next Breakout Token? This New Presale Altcoin Could Outpace SHIB by Miles Because SHIB is waiting on upgrades to take effect and boost wider adoption, it may not experience big gains for several months yet. In that case, investors may prefer to turn to newer tokens with more short-term potential, including presale coins that could rally when they list for the first time. One of the newest and most interesting presale tokens in the market right now is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an Ethereum-based project that will be launching a layer-two network for Bitcoin. The $HYPER Pre-Sale is now LIVE! Get up to speed https://t.co/yzXqAckjDw pic.twitter.com/sij7UFBOcb — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) May 8, 2025 It launched its presale last month, and has already raised in excess of $1 million, pointing to considerable early interest in the token and its platform. Its L2 network will provide Bitcoin users with faster transactions and lower fees, with the platform promising near-instant finality. Initially running on Ethereum, it will also expand to Solana after its launch, taking advantage of the latter’s high scalability. And this will enable Bitcoin Hyper to offer a range of DeFi apps and protocols, enabling BTC holders to put their funds into more volatile meme tokens. This all makes Bitcoin Hyper one of the more interesting new project to watch, with investors able to join its sale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . HYPER is currently available at $0.01185, although this will rise periodically for as long as the sale lasts.

2025-06-11T16:20:50,"Shocking Bitcoin Core Update Sparks OCEAN VP’s Exit From Crypto","BitcoinWorld Shocking Bitcoin Core Update Sparks OCEAN VP’s Exit From Crypto Major news from the world of Bitcoin mining is making waves. Jason Hughes, the vice president of the OCEAN mining pool , a prominent figure in the space, has announced a drastic decision: he is selling all his Bitcoin (BTC) and stepping away from the crypto industry entirely. This isn’t a sudden whim; his departure is directly linked to his strong opposition to an upcoming Bitcoin Core update . OCEAN VP Makes Shocking Exit Over Bitcoin Core Update The news, initially reported by Protos, details Jason Hughes’ significant move. As VP of OCEAN, a mining pool known for its commitment to transparent and non-custodial practices, Hughes’ voice carries weight within the community. His decision to liquidate his entire BTC stack and leave crypto permanently underscores the depth of his concerns regarding the direction of Bitcoin development. Hughes publicly expressed his profound disappointment, specifically calling out 31 developers involved in the project. This indicates a significant ideological rift concerning the future path of Bitcoin Core, the software that underpins the entire Bitcoin network . Understanding the Controversial Bitcoin Core Update v30 At the heart of this controversy is Version 30 of Bitcoin Core, an update slated for release in October. The key change causing friction involves how non-financial data is handled within Bitcoin transactions. Currently, there’s a widely recognized limit of 80 bytes for data included in the OP_RETURN field, which is typically used for embedding small pieces of information on the blockchain. The proposed change in v30 would significantly raise the default allowance for this non-financial data, potentially up to nearly 4MB. While node operators would retain the ability to configure this setting, the increased default is designed to facilitate broader functionality and potentially new use cases on the Bitcoin network . Think things like embedding larger amounts of arbitrary data or enabling more complex transaction types. Key Aspects of the v30 Update: Increased Data Limit: Default allowance for non-financial data jumps from 80 bytes (OP_RETURN) to potentially near 4MB. Purpose: Aims to enable broader functionality and new use cases on the network. Configurability: Node operators can still adjust the setting away from the default. Release Timeline: Currently scheduled for October. Why is the Bitcoin Network Facing Pushback? The proposed increase in the data limit isn’t universally welcomed. Critics, including Jason Hughes and other prominent figures like developers Luke Dashjr and BitcoinMechanic, argue that this change moves Bitcoin away from its original purpose primarily as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Their concerns center on several potential negative impacts: Network Strain: Allowing larger data payloads in transactions could lead to significantly larger block sizes, placing increased strain on the Bitcoin network . This means nodes would need more storage, bandwidth, and processing power to download, validate, and store the blockchain. This could potentially make it harder and more expensive for individuals to run full nodes, leading to increased centralization. Deviation from Purpose: Opponents argue that using the blockchain to store large amounts of non-financial or arbitrary data clutters the ledger and deviates from Bitcoin’s core function as a monetary network. They see this as a misuse of block space, which is a scarce and valuable resource. Impact on Fees: Increased demand for block space due to larger data could potentially drive up transaction fees, making simple Bitcoin transactions more expensive. The Perspective from Bitcoin Mining As VP of an OCEAN mining pool , Jason Hughes’ perspective is particularly relevant. Mining pools are at the forefront of processing transactions and creating new blocks. Miners are directly impacted by changes that affect block size, transaction volume, and network strain. While the update aims to enable new functionalities that might bring new types of transactions (and thus fees), the potential for increased network strain and deviation from core principles is a significant concern for those invested in the long-term health and decentralization of the Bitcoin network . Hughes’ decision highlights that this isn’t just a technical debate among developers; it has real-world consequences for individuals and businesses operating within the ecosystem, prompting even key players like an OCEAN VP to consider their future involvement. Voices of Dissent: The Stance of Luke Dashjr and Others Jason Hughes is not alone in his opposition. Developer Luke Dashjr has been a vocal critic of practices that utilize block space for non-financial data, often referring to them as ‘inscriptions’ or ‘spam’. His stance is rooted in a strict interpretation of Bitcoin’s design, emphasizing its role purely as a monetary system. BitcoinMechanic is another developer aligned with this view, raising concerns about the technical implications and the philosophical direction the project is taking. The fact that Hughes aligns himself with these particular developers underscores that his concerns are deeply technical and ideological, revolving around the fundamental principles he believes the Bitcoin network should uphold. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Community? An executive from a major Bitcoin mining pool exiting the space over a core protocol change is a significant event. It highlights the ongoing, sometimes intense, debates within the Bitcoin community about scalability, block space usage, and the project’s long-term vision. While some developers and users see the v30 update as a way to innovate and expand Bitcoin’s capabilities, others view it as a threat to its core properties of decentralization and its primary function as digital cash. This situation serves as a powerful example of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin development and governance – there’s no single authority dictating changes, leading to robust, sometimes contentious, discussions among developers, users, miners, and businesses. For the average Bitcoin holder or enthusiast, it’s a reminder of the technical complexities and the differing philosophies that shape the network’s evolution. In Conclusion: The departure of OCEAN VP Jason Hughes is a striking development stemming from the controversy surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin Core update v30. His decision, echoed by critics like Luke Dashjr , highlights deep concerns about potential network strain and whether the change aligns with the fundamental purpose of the Bitcoin network . This event underscores the vital, ongoing debate within the community about the future direction and technical evolution of Bitcoin, reminding everyone that even seemingly technical updates can have significant ideological and personal consequences.

2025-06-11T16:19:58,"The quiet campaign to make Scott Bessent the next Fed Chair — why crypto markets should care","What does crypto have to gain, or lose, if Trump taps Scott Bessent as the next Fed Chair and accelerates the shift toward pro-growth, risk-friendly policies? Table of Contents Scott Bessent is quietly rising in conversations about the Next Fed Chair How is the Fed Chair appointed? Scott Bessent Fed Chair talk gains momentum, but rivals like Kevin Warsh loom Decoding the Scott Bessent crypto calculus Experts see both stability and risk in a potential Jerome Powell resignation Scott Bessent is quietly rising in conversations about the Next Fed Chair Scott Bessent , the current U.S. Treasury Secretary, has quietly emerged at the center of a growing conversation around who will lead the Federal Reserve after J erome Powell ’s term ends in May 2026. According to a Jun. 10 report by Bloomberg, discussions are underway within and beyond the Trump administration about the possibility of nominating Bessent as Powell’s successor. While the White House officially dismissed the report as inaccurate, the timing and tone of recent developments suggest the idea may not be entirely off the table. President Trump hinted that a decision could arrive sooner than expected. During public remarks on June 6, he said he would name Powell’s replacement “very soon,” offering a rare public signal about a leadership transition still more than a year away. That comment also marked a shift in tone from earlier this year, when Trump repeatedly criticized Powell for keeping interest rates high. He has argued that elevated rates are harming economic growth and interfering with the administration’s broader goals. Tensions between Trump and Powell date back to Trump’s first term. Although Trump appointed Powell as Fed Chair in 2017, he soon became frustrated with Powell’s monetary policy stance, particularly the rate hikes in 2018 and 2019. The conflict resurfaced during Trump’s second term. Powell’s refusal to lower rates in the face of inflation concerns and Trump’s tariff policies was viewed by some in the administration as obstructive. On Apr. 4, Trump renewed his criticism on Truth Social, writing that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough.” Federal law prevents the president from removing a sitting Fed chair without cause, a point reinforced by a Supreme Court ruling in May 2025 that upheld the Fed’s institutional independence. The decision effectively blocked any attempt to replace Powell before his term expires. Bessent, for his part, advised against such an effort. In an interview with Politico on April 17, he warned that removing Powell early could trigger financial instability and undermine global confidence in U.S. economic governance. How is the Fed Chair appointed? The Fed Chair is nominated by the President of the U.S. and must be confirmed by the Senate. The position carries a four-year term, although reappointments are common, and chairs often serve across multiple administrations. While the Fedis structured to function independently of political pressure, the nomination process remains political in nature, especially during periods of economic volatility or leadership transition. Powell’s current term ends in May 2026, giving the Trump administration more than a year to evaluate potential successors. Even so, early signals about the direction of the nomination can influence market behavior well in advance of any formal decision. Analysts and global financial institutions track these developments closely. Shifts in leadership at the Fed often coincide with changes in monetary policy, interest rate strategy, and financial regulation. The role of the Chair extends beyond setting interest rates. It also includes managing inflation expectations, ensuring financial system stability, and communicating policy direction to domestic and international audiences. For investors, clarity around the next nominee, and the policy philosophy they are likely to bring, can influence confidence levels and capital allocation decisions across both traditional and crypto markets. Scott Bessent Fed Chair talk gains momentum, but rivals like Kevin Warsh loom Bessent’s financial background, including time spent as Soros Fund Management’s chief investment officer, has added to his credibility among Republican economic advisors. Still, Bessent is not the only name being discussed. Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and one of the candidates interviewed for the Treasury Secretary post in late 2024, is considered a strong contender due to his central banking experience. Economist Arthur Laffer has publicly endorsed Warsh, stating, “I think Kevin Warsh is just perfect for the job,” while acknowledging that Bessent’s strengths lie in areas other than monetary policy. Other figures floated include Kevin Hassett, who leads the White House’s National Economic Council, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, and former World Bank President David Malpass. Each brings a different profile, but all are viewed as potentially more aligned with Trump’s economic approach. What makes the situation notable is not just who the next Fed chair might be, but how early the discussion has begun. While Bessent has not publicly confirmed interest in the role, his proximity to decision-makers and his growing influence on Trump’s economic agenda are enough to keep the conversation going. Decoding the Scott Bessent crypto calculus If Bessent is eventually nominated to lead the Fed, the implications would likely go well beyond interest rate decisions. His record as Treasury Secretary already offers early signals about how he might approach monetary leadership. Since taking office in early 2025, Bessent has been a key figure in executing the economic side of President Trump’s policy agenda. He has worked to sustain financial market confidence while backing a mix of tax reductions and tariffs aimed at restructuring global trade relationships. He has also been directly involved in U.S.-China trade negotiations , a process that continues to influence volatility and risk sentiment. Both factors tend to spill over into crypto markets, where shifts in geopolitical or currency outlooks often affect demand for decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Bessent’s name has also been linked to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal, a Trump-era initiative exploring the idea of holding Bitcoin at a national level. While he has not taken a formal position on crypto regulation, several reports have described him as “pro-Bitcoin,” citing his openness to including digital assets within broader economic strategy. In a comment on Jun. 11, Bessent said, “I have the best job in Washington. The president will decide who’s best for the economy and the American people.” Although he did not confirm interest in the Fed Chair position, the remark reinforced the perception that he remains central to Trump’s economic team. If he were to assume leadership of the Fed, markets might expect a tilt toward a more flexible policy approach aligned with Trump’s preference for lower rates and looser financial conditions. During his time at Treasury, Bessent supported fiscal measures focused on growth, many of which benefit from accommodative monetary policy. If those views carry over into a central banking role, traders could interpret it as a signal for future rate cuts, particularly if inflation data continues to ease. Such a stance would likely benefit equities and risk assets, including crypto assets, which tend to perform better in environments where liquidity is high and interest rates are low. Even so, Bessent’s crypto positioning appears tactical rather than ideological. His support for digital assets seems rooted in advancing Trump’s broader economic strategy, rather than stemming from a strong personal belief in blockchain technology. For crypto markets, the more relevant factor may not be direct regulation but the macroeconomic backdrop Bessent would help shape, including interest rate policy, inflation expectations, and fiscal signals that continue to guide capital flows into or out of digital assets. Experts see both stability and risk in a potential Jerome Powell resignation Bessent’s potential nomination has drawn a broad spectrum of reactions from policymakers and market observers. Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance, pointed to Bessent’s standing in the global financial community as a reason to take his candidacy seriously. “Given the amount of trust and confidence that the global financial community has in Scott Bessent, he’s an obvious candidate,” Adams said, while also describing him as “a dark horse candidate,” noting that formal momentum remains uncertain. Steve Bannon, former White House strategist and close adviser to President Trump, spoke more emphatically. He praised Bessent’s policy leadership during a volatile start to 2025 and described him as both loyal to Trump’s agenda and dependable in the eyes of markets. “He’s not just the star of the cabinet, but a safe pair of hands for global capital markets,” Bannon said. Others have raised practical and institutional concerns. Economist Laffer acknowledged Bessent’s strengths but questioned the fit. “He is wonderful, but he already has a job. And his specialty is not monetary policy,” Laffer said. Criticism has also come from lawmakers focused on preserving the Fed’s independence. Senator Elizabeth Warren, speaking on the Senate floor in November 2024, warned that political interference in the central bank could erode investor confidence. “It would be a serious error for the Trump administration to interfere with the Fed’s independence,” she said, adding that placing a loyalist in the role might provoke instability rather than calm. Market veteran Ed Yardeni expressed similar concerns. In an interview with Barron’s, he cited Bessent’s past references to a “shadow Fed chair” model as troubling. Yardeni argued that even the perception of dual leadership could unsettle markets, stating it would “create a lot of noise in the market” and risk amplifying investor anxiety. Market behavior has historically responded quickly to signals around Fed leadership. Following President Trump’s criticism of Powell in April 2025, U.S. equities registered a 2% single-day decline, reflecting how even political rhetoric around the Fed can affect investor sentiment. Crypto markets, which tend to exhibit higher volatility, may react even more sharply to ambiguity or sudden shifts in central bank leadership. Without clarity, short-term swings could intensify. Whether Bessent ultimately calms or unsettles markets may depend less on the nomination itself and more on how investors interpret the balance between his alignment with the White House and his respect for institutional boundaries.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/scott-bessent-next-fed-chair-crypto-impact/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Feature|Federal Reserve|Jerome Powell|Regulation|United States",cryptocompare

Kidnappings are becoming a serious threat to high-profile crypto investors. On Wednesday, June 11, John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, pleaded not guilty to kidnapping a Bitcoin investor and attempting to steal his wallet data. According to prosecutors, the two men held and tortured the victim for three weeks starting on May 6, in a luxury SoHo apartment in New York. They allegedly beat him, shocked him with electric wires, and held him over a staircase before he managed to escape. The torture was intended to force the investor to hand over his Bitcoin wallet password, which would have given the attackers control over his crypto. If convicted, both suspects face up to life in prison for the brutal kidnapping.

Unlike traditional banking transfers, crypto transactions cannot be canceled or reversed. This means that once attackers gain access to funds, there is almost no way to retrieve them. For this reason, kidnappers tend to target individuals known to hold substantial crypto investments.

2025-06-11T16:13:38,"Ukraine Plans to Create Bitcoin Reserve to Strengthen Economy","The Ukrainian lawmakers recently introduced a new bill allowing the country to hold Bitcoin (BTC) in its official reserves. This shows that Ukraine is ready to join other countries that are looking to establish the same bill to support their economy. This move comes as the war-torn country faces economic turmoil and financial uncertainty. Ukraine Proposes Bitcoin as Part of National Reserves The newly proposed draft law is officially registered as Law No. 13356 in the Ukrainian parliament. This new bill authorizes the National Bank of Ukraine to include Bitcoin and other virtual assets in foreign exchange reserves. These reserves already hold gold and other regular currencies. Now, digital assets might be added. This new law lets Ukraine’s central bank choose how and when to use these digital reserves. It does not force immediate action, but it creates a legal path for future decisions. The bank will be responsible for managing these assets wisely. The bill was introduced by People’s Deputy Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a member of parliament who plays an important role in financial planning. He believes that allowing digital assets in the national reserves is a good way to keep up with global trends and improve the economy. Bitcoin As a Hedge Against a Difficult Global Economy Ukraine’s Bitcoin reserve plan comes at an important time. Many countries deal with high inflation, weaker currencies, and unstable markets. As the US dollar loses strength in the global market, some countries seek new ways to keep their economies safe. More people are seeing Bitcoin as a safe haven during an economic crash and a way to hedge against inflation. Ukraine’s interest in holding the flagship crypto for the long term shows that it is planning ahead to face these challenges. With a Bitcoin reserve, Ukraine hopes to stay stable during tough times and be ready to grow. Ukraine Aligns with Crypto-Adopting Nations Ukraine is not the only country making this change. Recently, countries like Pakistan have also talked about building Bitcoin reserves . The Pakistani government is trying new ideas to rebuild and grow its economy. El Salvador was the first to start this trend in 2021 and has already used Bitcoin to attract major investments. This shows how digital money can help boost economies if used wisely in national plans. In the U.S., a certain American military division reportedly supported establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . This shows growing belief in Bitcoin’s future value. Ukraine’s move aligns it with other countries that are changing how they handle money. If the new law passes and is used well, Ukraine could benefit in many ways. This could be a big step in modernizing Ukraine’s financial system and making the country more competitive globally.

2025-06-11T16:07:07,"The Case for Investing in Digital Assets","You’ve been at the forefront of creating digital asset products from an early stage. Why do you think investors should consider putting money into digital assets? First of all, with digital assets, you get a quantitative diversity of return. Per increment of risk to reward, the ratio of the performance of bitcoin to the S&P 500 is more than three to one. So if you're going to invest money, one of the best risk-reward ratios is, without question, in digital assets as a stand-alone asset class. Secondly, you get something new with digital assets that you didn't have before, and that's transparency. Public blockchains are auditable in real time, so they are trustless. You also get economies of scale and capital efficiencies. That's what this technology does — it makes things easier, cheaper, better and faster. Thirdly, I believe bitcoin is one of the most important assets in all of human history because it removes the need of central banks. At the core of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), is recreating traditional financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading, but without relying on centralized intermediaries like banks. This cuts out the middleman. Lastly, as the application layer of Web3 continues to evolve, the ease of use and access becomes better. If you look at the adoption curve now, we're about to hit an acceleration point. Six to eight years ago, the security was just gnarly. Now, you have multi-party computation (MPC) technology and multi-sig wallets, and Chainalysis doing work to ensure illicit funds aren't mixed into the funds you're acquiring. This offers a more robust infrastructure to let the application layer bring product and services to the masses at scale, and easier to use. What are the biggest obstacles preventing people from investing in digital assets? The first is recency bias. We saw in 2022 the failure of FTX, Celsius and others, which was a mix of counterparty failure, fraud and crimes. No one would fault anybody for being hesitant to get into digital assets because of that, but I will point out that the second-most fined company ever in the history of mankind is JP Morgan. So while you can forgive people for recency bias, I would argue they're not appraising it properly against TradFi counterparty risk. Then, whatever people’s recency bias is anchoring them to, the tendency is to follow up with confirmation bias, ""I don't want to touch that asset, since memecoins are down 90%.” So I believe these two biases combined do to not motivate people to underwrite the space properly. Secondly, there’s a lack of understanding and awareness that all TradFi assets are held in “street name,” meaning you don't own it — your brokerage firm does. People also aren't aware that banks’ reserve ratios are in single digit percentages all over the world, meaning if you have money in a bank, it's actually not there. There’s a lack of appreciation of the fractional reserve banking system, which arguably has caused all of the credit crises throughout history. Overall, it’s important to put headlines of bad actors and failed memecoins aside. Look at the infrastructure and all it offers. With Web3, you have shared security or privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. You can participate in certain networks to make them stronger, which then offers you staking yield. If you provide liquidity, you can get an automated market maker (AMM) yield. The system is efficient and strong. What are the best ways to get alpha in today’s volatile markets? First, have an accumulation strategy. This means you pick a portfolio of your best 5, 10, or 20 assets and dollar cost average them. Then, develop a trading plan. For example, if Ethereum drops to $1,200, then what am I doing? Or if Ethereum goes to $4,000, what will I do? Next, you want to “invest with the trend,” which I see as a three-factored process. First, we're looking at the adoption curve. Then, we're looking at monthly data points for the establishment of the trend. Lastly, appraise the progression of the technology and the value proposition of the products and services of the entire space. Those three things are how you effectively contemplate where we are in a trend, in my opinion. Tell me more about the HD CoinDesk Acheilus Fund. We launched the HD Acheilus Fund in mid-May to leverage CoinDesk Indices’ Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators and it's diversified because it trades the CoinDesk 20. This actively managed, single-strategy fund targets institutional investors, aiming to profit from crypto market uptrends while avoiding drawdowns. We use a combination of quantitative and macroeconomic signals to shift between crypto tokens and cash, delivering a disciplined, outcome-driven cryptocurrency investment strategy. In my opinion, this is the easiest push button allocation anybody can ever make in crypto. Our award-winning funds are centered around a dedicated compliance team, ensuring adherence to all CFTC and SEC regulations while anticipating future changes. Also, we have established robust internal policies and procedures that meet or exceed regulatory requirements, covering areas such as anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), data protection, and risk management. All of this speaks to a forward-thinking culture that governs all our activities. Where can someone learn more about the fund?

The total prize pool for the competition is $14 million, with $10 million going to the winner and the remaining pool being spread across first, second and regional winners. Unlike trading competitions of the past set up by the likes of Bybit and BitMEX , which targeted retail traders, the Bullish competition is aimed at professional traders, and they will be judged on an array of factors, including profit and risk metrics. These factors will be judged by industry veterans from Annamite Capital, Nine Blocks Capital, Nickel Digital and AlgoQuant. The finalists may be asked to present their trading strategies to the judges before the event concludes. The competition comes at a time when the cryptocurrency industry is experiencing its largest wave of institutional adoption to date, which has been reinforced by public companies flocking to add bitcoin BTC to their respective balance sheets. Trading activity has also mirrored this shift, with the CME setting records earlier this year in terms of volume and open interest. A CoinDesk Indices report in April also suggested that institutions were driving bitcoin dominance earlier this year.

2025-06-11T16:04:48,"Ukraine May Let Central Bank Add Bitcoin to Reserves","Ukrainian lawmakers have submitted a draft bill that would allow the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in its official reserves. The proposal was introduced as bill number 13356 in the Verkhovna Rada this Tuesday. It seeks to amend the law “On the National Bank of Ukraine” by authorizing the central bank to hold crypto assets alongside gold and foreign currencies. Discretionary Power for the Central Bank Unlike mandatory reserve requirements, this draft bill gives the NBU full discretion over crypto holdings. According to MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak, the bill neither compels nor directs the bank to invest in Bitcoin or other crypto assets. “How, when and how much should be the decision of the regulator itself,” Zhelezniak said on his Telegram channel. A Move to Strengthen Economic Stability Lawmakers behind the bill argue that managing crypto reserves could bolster Ukraine’s macroeconomic stability. It would also support the development of the nation’s digital economy. “Proper management of crypto reserves will help strengthen macroeconomic stability and create new opportunities for the development of the digital economy,” Zhelezniak posted on Telegram. Industry Involvement in Drafting The draft bill received input from notable stakeholders. Early in the week, Zhelezniak appeared in a video with Kyrylo Khomiakov, Binance’s regional head for Central & Eastern European and Central Asian countries. Khomiakov was one of the bill’s contributors, following reports that Binance advises several governments on establishing crypto reserves. Legal experts were also involved. Co‑author Petr Bilyk, head of AI practice at Juscutum Legal Engineering and a member of Ukraine’s AI expert committee, helped draft the legislation. A Thoughtful, not Rushed, Initiative Zhelezniak emphasized this isn’t an aggressive push by Kyiv to adopt crypto. Rather, it is a strategic move to avoid being left behind as global interest in digital asset reserves grows. “This story has the right to life, and, as we see, many countries are implementing it,” he said, citing experiments by the U.S., El Salvador, and others. The draft follows earlier reports that Ukraine is nearing final stages of crafting a bill on state crypto reserves. This development comes amid ongoing discussions about peace with Russia, suggesting Ukraine is preparing financially for post-war stability. What Comes Next Broad parliamentary review and debate are expected before the bill advances. If approved, Ukraine would join a small but growing group of nations exploring digital assets as part of sovereign reserves. Observers will be watching how the NBU responds, and whether reserve allocations will remain symbolic or evolve into meaningful financial strategies. Ukraine’s willingness to explore this frontier reflects an appetite for financial innovation, while also recognizing the need for careful oversight.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/ukraine-may-let-central-bank-add-bitcoin-to-reserves/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|BNB","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T16:02:08,"Ethereum Is On The Rise Again! Analysis Company Explains The Reason Behind The Rise In ETH!","The largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has risen to $ 2,800 with the rise it has experienced in the last 24 hours. While the market is expecting ETH to break and exceed the $ 3,000 level, the analysis company evaluated ETH's recent rise. Accordingly, analytics firm Matrixport said that Ethereum's recent rally was due to leverage and not fundamentals. In its latest analysis from the X account, Matrixport highlighted that Ethereum’s outflow was driven by the leveraged trading market rather than the spot market. Analysts stated that the ETH funding rate rose to 13.7%, the highest level since February, and that this level is generally a bullish sign and attracts ETH ETF inflows by mobilizing institutional investors. More importantly, ETH futures open interest is approaching its December 2024 peak, according to analysts, suggesting that leveraged investors, not spot buyers, are leading the ETH rally. “The current Ethereum rally is based on leveraged futures trading, not spot trading. “Ethereum open interest (OI) is near its all-time high from December of last year. Ethereum funding rate has also increased to 13.7%. This is the highest level since February.” Matrixport analysts recently noted a sharp increase in ETH call options. At this point, analysts comparing Ethereum and Bitcoin stated that ETH is driven by the leveraged market rather than spot demand, while Bitcoin continues to be driven primarily by spot demand. *This is not investment advice.

Zheleznyak said the proposed law will not conflict with the nation’s international commitments. A group of MPs from the Holos party of Ukraine, led by Yaroslav Zheleznyak, submitted a legislative proposal No. 13356 to the parliament on Tuesday. The bill proposed the inclusion of digital assets such as Bitcoin and other crypto options into the country’s gold and foreign exchange reserves. Zheleznyak said that under the proposed bill, the National Bank of Ukraine can include digital assets in the nation’s reserves. The MP added that the central bank of Ukraine would have the authority to decide on the timing, approach, and volume of incorporating digital assets in the reserves. Zheleznyak argued that the proposal would not go against the country’s international commitments. Private sector supports the inclusion of digital assets in reserves 💥 BREAKING: 🇺🇦 UKRAINE PROPOSES BILL TO ALLOW CENTRAL BANK TO HOLD DIGITAL ASSETS IN NATIONAL RESERVES. BULLISH FOR CRYPTO & #XRP pic.twitter.com/8OKunadXRk — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 11, 2025 The government of Ukraine has been preparing an act to establish a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ukraine held approximately 46,351 BTC as of December 2024, valued at $4.8 billion, primarily acquired through asset seizures, donations, and fundraising during the war. The move to create a BTC reserve has received support from the private sector, with the regional Head of Binance for Central and Eastern Europe, Kirill Khomyakov, welcoming the proposal. Khomyakov revealed that establishing the BTC reserve would need significant legislation amendments. The head of Binance added that creating the reserve was a positive step, saying it would lead to clearer regulations regarding crypto assets. In April, Ukraine’s parliamentary Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy passed a new legislation on crypto. The bill was, however, withdrawn following a request from the Office of the President and the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC). The commission later revealed that it had no authority to halt the bill. The NSSMC, however, submitted a list of 80 suggested changes and comments to the parliament. Central banks say Bitcoin unfit for reserves European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde recently trashed the idea of creating European crypto reserves. Lagarde stated there was no place for cryptocurrency in Europe’s central banking. The ECB President said she was confident digital assets would not enter the reserves of Europe’s central banks. Lagarde maintained that the national reserves should remain liquid, safe, and secure. The Czech National Bank also recently announced that its board had agreed to broaden its national reserves portfolio to incorporate other asset classes without pointing out Bitcoin or other digital assets. Poland’s central bank also recently revealed that it would not invest in crypto assets. The bank claimed that cryptocurrency was an asset class bearing a very high risk. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, recently stated that the central bank was not authorized to own digital assets. Martin Schlegel, the president of the Swiss National Bank, said in March that digital assets did not meet the bank’s currency reserve standards, dismissing crypto advocates’ demands that the institution hold BTC as a hedge against increasing global economic uncertainties. Crypto campaigner Luzious Meisser, also Bitcoin Suisse’s board member, argued that holding BTC made more sense as the world moved towards a multipolar order, where the official currencies, the euro and dollar, were weakening. The crypto campaigners had launched an initiative to mount pressure on the SNB to acquire Bitcoin, claiming that the economic crisis triggered by Trump’s tariffs made it more crucial for the institution to diversify government reserves. Schlegel rejected the suggestions, arguing that the digital asset’s market liquidity was a big concern as the institution was required at all times to be able to acquire or sell foreign exchange.

2025-06-11T16:00:29,"Quantum BioPharma Commits $5 Million to Bitcoin and Crypto Assets","BitcoinWorld Quantum BioPharma Commits $5 Million to Bitcoin and Crypto Assets In a move signaling growing confidence in the digital asset space, Nasdaq-listed biotech and medical research firm, Quantum BioPharma , has significantly expanded its cryptocurrency portfolio. The company announced a substantial purchase of additional Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies, bringing their total investment in this asset class to an impressive $5 million . This decision, according to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, received official approval from the company’s board of directors, highlighting a deliberate and strategic approach to integrating digital assets into their financial planning. While the specific ‘other cryptocurrencies’ acquired were not detailed in the announcement, the focus on Bitcoin suggests a foundational belief in the leading digital asset’s value proposition. Why Are Companies Like Quantum BioPharma Pursuing a Bitcoin Investment Strategy? The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin investment and other digital assets to their balance sheets has been gaining momentum, particularly over the past few years. For companies like Quantum BioPharma, operating in a traditional sector like biotech, this move might seem unconventional at first glance. However, several compelling reasons often drive such decisions: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about currency devaluation and inflation rising globally, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value and a hedge against traditional financial system risks due to its decentralized nature and capped supply. Diversification: Adding uncorrelated assets to a corporate treasury can help diversify risk beyond traditional cash, bonds, and equities. Digital assets offer a new avenue for potential growth independent of the core business operations. Potential for Growth: Despite volatility, the long-term growth trajectory of Bitcoin and select cryptocurrencies remains attractive to investors seeking higher potential returns than traditional low-yield assets. Forward-Thinking Stance: Embracing digital assets can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking, potentially appealing to a broader range of investors and stakeholders interested in the future of finance and technology. Cash Management: For companies holding significant cash reserves, especially in a low-interest-rate environment, deploying a portion into digital assets can be seen as a way to generate potential returns on otherwise stagnant capital. Quantum BioPharma’s decision underscores that the appeal of digital assets is extending beyond tech-centric firms and reaching into diverse industries, including the complex world of biotechnology and medical research. Understanding Corporate Crypto Holdings: More Than Just Bitcoin While Bitcoin often grabs the headlines, the concept of corporate crypto holdings encompasses a broader range of digital assets. Companies might choose to hold other cryptocurrencies for various strategic reasons: Ethereum (ETH): As the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum is seen by some as a bet on the future of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs. Stablecoins: Some companies might hold stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) for transactional purposes, ease of transfer, or as a temporary holding place within the crypto ecosystem, though Quantum BioPharma’s announcement focuses on investment assets. Altcoins: A smaller portion might be allocated to other altcoins based on specific research or perceived potential, although this carries significantly higher risk. Quantum BioPharma’s statement mentioning ‘other cryptocurrencies’ alongside Bitcoin suggests a diversified approach within the digital asset class, tailored to their specific risk tolerance and investment objectives. The $5 million total represents a significant commitment for a company whose primary focus is highly specialized scientific research. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption: A Growing Trend The move by Quantum BioPharma is part of a larger narrative of institutional crypto adoption . What began with a few pioneering companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla has evolved into a more widespread phenomenon. Investment funds, asset managers, and now companies from various sectors are exploring or actively engaging with digital assets. This trend is driven by increasing regulatory clarity in some regions, the development of more robust infrastructure for institutional investors (custody solutions, trading platforms), and a growing understanding of the digital asset market. Key indicators of this trend include: Examples of Companies with Significant Bitcoin/Crypto Holdings: Company Industry Notable Holdings (Examples) MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Significant Bitcoin holdings (often the largest corporate holder) Tesla Electric Vehicles & Clean Energy Bitcoin Block, Inc. (formerly Square) Financial Services Bitcoin Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin (from mining operations) Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange Various Cryptocurrencies While Quantum BioPharma’s $5 million holding is modest compared to giants like MicroStrategy, it is significant relative to the company’s likely balance sheet size and signals a broader acceptance of digital assets as a legitimate part of a corporate financial digital asset strategy . Navigating the Challenges and Risks Investing in cryptocurrencies is not without its challenges and risks, particularly for publicly traded companies like Quantum BioPharma. These include: Volatility: Digital asset prices can experience dramatic and rapid fluctuations, which can impact a company’s reported earnings and balance sheet valuation. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, creating potential risks related to compliance, taxation, and future restrictions. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires sophisticated security measures to protect against hacking, theft, and loss of private keys. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for cryptocurrencies are still developing, which can create complexities in financial reporting. Public Perception: While growing, mainstream acceptance of crypto is not universal, and some shareholders or customers may view such investments negatively. Quantum BioPharma’s board approval suggests they have likely considered these factors and established protocols for managing these risks, including secure custody solutions and a clear investment rationale. What Does This Mean for Quantum BioPharma and the Market? For Quantum BioPharma, this investment represents a strategic allocation of capital aimed at potentially enhancing treasury returns and diversifying assets. It positions them among a growing group of companies embracing the future of finance. The success or performance of this digital asset portfolio will likely be watched by investors and potentially influence future corporate treasury decisions within the biotech sector. For the broader market, Quantum BioPharma’s announcement adds another data point to the trend of institutional crypto adoption . Each new company, regardless of sector, that publicly discloses a significant crypto holding contributes to the legitimization and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. It signals to other corporate treasurers and boards that exploring a digital asset strategy is becoming a viable, albeit still relatively novel, option. Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering Crypto Quantum BioPharma’s move offers insights for other companies contemplating adding digital assets to their balance sheet: Board Education & Approval: Ensure leadership understands the asset class, risks, and rationale. Board approval is crucial for legitimacy and governance. Define Objectives: Clearly articulate why you are investing (e.g., inflation hedge, growth, diversification) and what percentage of the treasury is appropriate. Start with Bitcoin: BTC is often the first step due to its liquidity, market cap, and established narrative as ‘digital gold’. Research Custody Solutions: Securely storing digital assets is paramount. Explore reputable institutional-grade custodians. Consult Experts: Engage with legal, accounting, and financial advisors experienced in digital assets. Develop a Policy: Establish clear internal policies for acquisition, management, and risk mitigation. Quantum BioPharma’s $5 million commitment, while a fraction of their total assets, demonstrates that companies are moving beyond just exploring and are actively implementing a digital asset strategy . Conclusion: A Biotech Firm’s Bold Step into Digital Assets Quantum BioPharma’s decision to boost its corporate crypto holdings to $5 million, including significant Bitcoin investment , is a noteworthy development. It signifies the increasing penetration of digital assets into traditional industries and underscores the growing trend of institutional crypto adoption . While risks remain, the strategic rationale based on diversification, inflation hedging, and growth potential is clearly compelling for a growing number of corporate boards. This move by a Nasdaq-listed biotech firm further solidifies the position of digital assets as a legitimate component of a forward-thinking digital asset strategy for companies across diverse sectors.

2025-06-11T16:00:18,"Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: ‘Fair Price’ Today Is $230,000","Bitcoin is once again knocking on the door of price discovery, but researchers at Bitwise Asset Management argue that spot quotations still understate what the network is worth. In their Week 24 Crypto Market Compass circulated late Tuesday, Dr. André Dragosch, Bitwise’s Head of Research for Europe, and analyst Ayush Tripathi calculate that “quantitative models estimate Bitcoin’s hypothetical ‘fair value’ amid the current sovereign default probabilities at around $230,000 today.” The figure implies a premium of just over 110 percent to the market price, which was hovering near $109,600 at press time on 11 June 2025. Bitcoin’s ‘True Worth’ Is Explosive Dragosch ties that assessment to the rally in sovereign-risk hedges. United-States one-year credit-default-swap spreads are trading near half-percentage-point territory—levels last seen during the 2023 debt-ceiling scare—reflecting “broader concerns over the US fiscal deficit,” Reuters reported last week. “Bitcoin can provide an alternative ‘portfolio insurance’ against widespread sovereign defaults as a scarce, decentralised asset which is free of counterparty risks,” the note argues, adding that net interest outlays projected by the Congressional Budget Office point to a tripling of US debt-service costs to roughly $3 trillion by 2030. Related Reading: Bitcoin Skyrockets Past $108,000 Amid US-China Tariff Discussions The macro backdrop, however, is not the only pillar supporting Bitwise’s fair-value call. The firm’s in-house Cryptoasset Sentiment Index shows twelve of fifteen market-breadth gauges trending higher, while the cross-asset risk-appetite index (CARA) compiled from equities, credit, rates and commodities has surged to a five-year high. “Both cryptoasset and cross-asset sentiment are now decisively bullish,” Dragosch writes, noting that Bitcoin’s climb back above $110,000 places it within two percent of the all-time high near $112,000 set in May. On-chain data remain constructive. Exchange reserves have slipped to 2.91 million BTC—about 14.6 percent of the circulating supply—after whales withdrew an estimated 390,632 BTC last week. At the same time, net exchange-spot outflows slowed to roughly $0.53 billion from $1.78 billion the previous week, suggesting lighter profit-taking pressure. Derivative positioning echoes the spot-market resilience. Aggregate Bitcoin futures open interest added 2,200 BTC across venues, while the CME leg gained 6.4 k BTC. Funding rates on perpetual swaps stayed positive overall despite flipping negative for parts of the weekend, and the three-month annualised basis held around 6.3 percent. In options, open interest expanded by 27,300 BTC, with the put-to-call ratio settling at 0.55; one-month 25-delta skew remained modestly negative, implying continued demand for downside hedges even as realised volatility slipped to 28.2 percent. Institutional flows are reinforcing the bullish tone. Global crypto ETPs absorbed $488.5 million last week, of which $254.9 million went into Bitcoin products. US spot Bitcoin ETFs led the charge with $525 million of inflows, counterbalanced by a $24.1 million weekly leak from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Bitwise’s own BITB vehicle attracted $78.1 million, while its European physical Bitcoin ETP (BTCE) saw only marginal outflows. Ethereum products also enjoyed $260.9 million in net inflows, maintaining the broad-based risk bid. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative Bitwise concedes that headline risk can still provoke sharp, short-lived drawdowns—last week’s spat between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump briefly drove BTC back to $100,000—but sees structural forces firmly tilted to the upside. “US economic policy uncertainty has most likely passed its zenith already and continues to decline at the margin,” Dragosch writes, pointing to May non-farm-payroll growth of 139,000 and a moderation in recession odds. With Bitcoin already outperforming traditional assets year-to-date and cross-asset sentiment now confirmed by Bitwise’s indicators, the analysts argue that the market is beginning to price the asset less as a speculative vehicle and more as a macro hedge. Whether traders embrace the $230,000 fair-value marker hinges on the same variables underscored in the note—sovereign-risk premiums, policy uncertainty and the pace of institutional adoption—but the groundwork, they say, is visible on-chain, on desks and in the flow data. “Bitcoin also reclaimed 110k USD and is close to its previous all-time high,” the report reminds readers. For Bitwise, that proximity is not an end point but a staging area: the monetary asset’s intrinsic value, they conclude, resides “considerably further north.” At press time, BTC traded at $109,617.

With over 30% of circulating supply now held by centralized entities including exchanges, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), companies and sovereigns, bitcoin is undergoing a structural shift driven by long-term capital and strategic custody, the report said. Each sovereign dollar invested in bitcoin carries an outsized impact, the report said, with $1 of SBR capital potentially generating $25 in market cap expansion and $1.70 in lasting value. This shows the ""reflexive power of institutional inflows."" U.S. President Donald Trump directed his administration in March to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve to hold the assets that have been seized by the government. He also called for a stockpile of other types of digital assets. Though seeded with seized assets, the SBR validates the largest cryptocurrency's place in modern reserve strategy, one increasingly reflected in how institutions value and integrate the asset into global finance, the note said. While early holders still dominate ownership, sovereign endorsement is accelerating institutional confidence, according to Gemini. Liquid supply remains stable as assets migrate from exchanges to custodians, signaling consolidation rather than contraction, the report noted. Bitcoin volatility has declined, which is good for adoption. Recent cycles have been ""defined by more consistent, sustained rallies that appeal to long-term investors,"" the report added.

With U.S. CPI data about to be released on Wednesday, could this provide the boost that sends $BTC up past the all-time high and into price discovery? $BTC continues to hold $109,000 support level Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart reveals that the $BTC price is continuing to hold the $109,000 support level. This level will be key for the bulls to hold as $BTC will need a secure base from which to climb back to the all-time high. A slight resistance at $109,600 is keeping the price at bay for the time being, but with U.S. CPI data just about to be released, if positive, a surge to $112,000 has the potential to take place quite quickly. If the data comes in negative, a dip could occur which might bring $BTC back to around $107,000, with $106,000 a strong support level just below this. Generally positive on daily time frame Source: TradingView On the daily time frame all is looking quite good for Bitcoin. The exit from the small wedge was successful, and has resulted in the $BTC currently consolidating above that $109,000 level. There is just one point of concern, in that the Stochastic RSI indicators are reaching the top in this time frame. This also coincides with the 8-hour and 12-hour time frames where the indicators are now on the way down.

Paying particular attention to the two indicators at the bottom of the chart it can be seen that there could be more positive price action to come. The Stochastic RSI has its indicators just having crossed up through the 50.00 level, signalling plenty of upside price momentum, while the MACD at the bottom of the chart has just experienced a cross up of the indicator lines as the green histogram bars are just beginning to grow. At time of going to press, the U.S. CPI data has been released . This was cooler than expected for May, so it seems the Trump tariffs have not trickled through to affect the data negatively thus far. The S&P 500 is up slightly on the news. It still remains to be seen how $BTC will react. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-11T15:50:25,"Altcoin Season Alert: Index Shows Crypto Market in Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Alert: Index Shows Crypto Market in Bitcoin Season Are you wondering whether it’s time for altcoins to shine? The latest data from a key industry metric suggests we’re not quite there yet. The Altcoin Season Index, a popular gauge for understanding the current state of the crypto market , recently registered a figure that firmly places us in ‘Bitcoin Season’. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for investors trying to navigate the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency space. Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index provides a snapshot of how the broader market is performing relative to Bitcoin over a specific period. What it Measures: The index looks at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The Timeframe: It specifically analyzes the performance of these top altcoins compared to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Thresholds: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. For the market to be considered in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority of these top altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Specifically, at least 75% of the top 100 coins need to have posted better returns than BTC. Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day window. Anything in between is often considered a transition period or ‘Other’. Currently: It’s Bitcoin Season As of 00:33 UTC on June 11, the Altcoin Season Index stood at 31. While this was a slight increase of two points from the previous day, it remains well below the 75 threshold required for Altcoin Season and firmly within the zone indicating Bitcoin Season . This means that over the last three months, a large percentage of the top 100 altcoins have underperformed relative to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been the dominant performer, capturing a larger share of market gains or holding value better during downturns compared to most other cryptocurrencies. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for the Crypto Market? When the market is in Bitcoin Season , it typically signifies that capital is flowing primarily into Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin is leading the market movements. This can happen for several reasons: Dominance Shift: Bitcoin’s market dominance tends to increase. Safe Haven Narrative: In uncertain economic times or during periods of market consolidation, investors may view Bitcoin as a relatively safer asset compared to the more volatile altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional inflows often target Bitcoin first, before potentially moving down the market cap ladder. Pre-Alt Season Consolidation: Sometimes, Bitcoin Season precedes an Altcoin Season, acting as a phase where Bitcoin consolidates gains or makes significant moves before capital rotates into altcoins seeking higher potential returns. For participants in the crypto market , Bitcoin Season means that simply holding a diversified basket of altcoins might not yield optimal results compared to focusing on Bitcoin or carefully selecting altcoins with strong individual catalysts. Why Isn’t It Altcoin Season Yet? Investors eagerly anticipate Altcoin Season because it’s historically the period where many smaller cryptocurrencies experience explosive growth, often posting returns that far outstrip Bitcoin’s performance. However, the index at 31 clearly shows that the broad altcoin market is not currently in this phase. Factors preventing a widespread Altcoin Season might include: Lack of strong, broad market narratives driving capital into altcoins. Lingering macroeconomic uncertainty. Focus remaining on Bitcoin due to specific events (like ETF performance or halving cycle aftermath). Altcoins consolidating after previous runs. Navigating the Current Cryptocurrency Landscape So, how should you approach the cryptocurrency market when the Altcoin Season Index indicates Bitcoin Season? Here are a few considerations: Focus on Bitcoin: Given Bitcoin’s current dominance, it may be a primary focus for investment during this period. Selective Altcoin Investing: Instead of broad diversification across altcoins, focus on specific projects with strong fundamentals, upcoming milestones, or unique narratives that might allow them to outperform even in a Bitcoin-dominated market. Risk Management: Altcoins can be particularly volatile when not in their peak season. Employ robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-losses and not over-allocating to single altcoin positions. Observe Market Rotation: Keep a close eye on market dynamics. Signs that the index is rising towards the 75 threshold could indicate capital starting to rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. Stay Informed: Follow news and developments for both Bitcoin and promising altcoin projects. Understanding the catalysts driving individual assets is crucial. The current index reading serves as a reminder that market cycles are real and understanding the prevailing conditions is key to making informed investment decisions in the volatile world of cryptocurrency . Conclusion: Patience During Bitcoin’s Reign The Altcoin Season Index sitting at 31 confirms that the crypto market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . This means that, for now, Bitcoin is the primary driver and performer compared to the majority of the top 100 altcoins. While this might temper the excitement for immediate, broad altcoin rallies, it provides clarity on the current market structure. Understanding this phase is crucial for investors. It calls for potentially shifting focus towards Bitcoin or being highly selective with altcoin exposure, rather than expecting widespread gains across the board. While Altcoin Season remains a highly anticipated event, the current data suggests patience is required. Keep monitoring the index and market dynamics for signs of a potential shift, but for now, Bitcoin holds the crown.
