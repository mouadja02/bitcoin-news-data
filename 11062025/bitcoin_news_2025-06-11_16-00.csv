2025-06-11T13:51:37,"Mercurity Fintech plans $800m Bitcoin reserve, Eyes Russell 2000 inclusion","Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. has announced an $800 million financing plan to establish a long-term Bitcoin treasury reserve. The initiative marks a strategic shift for the blockchain-powered fintech group, which now aims to build a digital asset treasury supported by blockchain-native custody, staking, and tokenized management services. According to MFH, the reserve will be managed using institutional-grade custodial infrastructure and staking-enabled liquidity tools. The company plans to generate yield from its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings while enhancing balance sheet resilience and deepening alignment with decentralized finance protocols. CEO Shi Qiu said the initiative reflects a belief in Bitcoin’s future role in financial infrastructure. “We are positioning our company to be a key player in the evolving digital financial ecosystem,” Qiu stated.

The expected upgrade from the Russell Microcap Index could boost visibility among institutional investors and index-linked funds. MFH’s move aligns with a growing trend among public companies using Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Interest from corporations in digital assets is increasing , with more and more public companies allocating Bitcoin to their balance sheets, according to a recent report from Binance.

2025-06-11T13:49:02,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Eyes New ATH After Testing $110,000","Bitcoin (BTC) is down almost 1% during the ongoing session as buyers lost momentum after crossing $110,000 earlier this week. The flagship cryptocurrency tested the $110,000 level twice this week, suggesting a potential move past its all-time high could become a possibility. Despite the drop during the ongoing session, BTC remained marginally up in the past 24 hours and is nearly 4% up over the past week. Positive CPI Data Could Boost Markets Bitcoin’s (BTC) push towards a new all-time high has stalled after the price fell below $110,000 during the ongoing session. However, it still retains the potential of setting a new all-time high, especially if the CPI data favors risk assets like Bitcoin . Market experts and investors are waiting for the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which could bring volatility to BTC . Some analysts anticipate a 2.5% increase, while others predict an increase between 2.1% and 2.3%, suggesting that it was a sign inflation was cooling. Low inflation could pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates, boosting the stock and crypto markets. The analyst also highlighted Bitcoin’s negative funding rate as another indicator of an impending rally and a new all-time high. “What’s crazy right now is the fact that the Bitcoin funding rate is currently negative, which means that there are more shorts than longs open, which indicates an extremely healthy market and even supports the bullish thesis. Also, there is plenty of liquidity in the region between 108 and 110K, which is going to be taken as well for sure in the coming days.” A Correction To $90,000 Still Possible While most analysts are optimistic about an impending market rally pushing Bitcoin to new highs, Sergei Gorev, Head of Risk at Youhodler, stated that a potential “head and shoulder” pattern could signal a reversal. The analyst stated, “ BTC quotes are currently in a state of uncertainty. On the one hand, many global traders are gradually withdrawing from the US currency and shifting to more risky assets, including cryptocurrencies. This has a positive effect on the BTC exchange rate. On the other hand, the price on the BTC chart is behaving extremely erratically, and there is currently a possibility of a local price hike. There is a ‘Head and Shoulders’ picture, which, if implemented in its scenario, can lead to a correction in the price to the level of $92,000.” Michael Saylor Dismisses Crypto Winter Fears Strategy co-founder and executive Chairman Michael Saylor has dismissed concerns about a crypto winter. Saylor suggested that Bitcoin’s growing institutional adoption and declining exchange reserves could push the flagship cryptocurrency to $1 million. Saylor stated, “Winter is not coming back. We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” Asset manager ARK Invest also raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. According to Saylor, 450 BTC are available for sale everyday, valued at roughly $50 million at current prices. Saylor believes that if such a significant amount is bought on a daily basis, the price must go higher. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up.” Saylor also highlighted public companies purchasing massive amounts of Bitcoin. Saylor’s own firm holds 582,000 BTC worth approximately $63.85 billion. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” Saylor reiterated President Trump’s support for Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry, along with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins, and also highlighted that traditional banks and financial institutions are pivoting to Bitcoin and providing custody services. “Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC)’s rally stalled around the $110,000 mark as buyers lost momentum after reaching $110,546. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday to reclaim $110,000 but found itself back in bearish territory during the ongoing session, trading around $109,739 after a decline of nearly 1%. According to Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan, the analytics firm is recording significant anticipation for BTC moving to a new all-time high on social media. However, the analyst stated that the market is not ready for a bullish surge. “It wouldn’t be surprising if we do break through very soon after we see a few frustrating ‘close calls’ that cause small traders to turn sour and impatient on BTC , neutralizing this level of optimism.” Meanwhile, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive, believes BTC will underperform during the third quarter of 2025. The analyst backed up his assessment with historical data. Historically, Q3 has been Bitcoin’s weakest, with an average return of around 6%. On the other hand, Q4 has been BTC’s strongest, delivering an average return of over 85%. Dawson also highlighted macroeconomic concerns as another reason for BTC’s subdued returns during Q3 2025. “Despite political pressure for rate cuts, the Fed seems poised to keep interest rates steady, which could dampen Bitcoin’s appeal for outsized returns.” BTC traded positively the previous weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,779. The price fell to an intraday low of $103,768 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,435. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3% to $101,614. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, it recovered on Friday, rising 2.72% and settling at $104,378. Source: TradingView BTC traded in positive territory over the weekend, rising 1.15% on Saturday and registering a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price surged over 4%, surging past $110,000 and the 20-day SMA and settling at $110,251. BTC fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday as buyers lost momentum. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. The current session sees BTC marginally down, trading around $109,700. Buyers will look to regain control and push the price back above $110,000. If bullish sentiment persists, BTC could set a new all-time high in the near term. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-11T13:39:54,"GameStop: Positive Cash Flows And... Bitcoin","Summary GameStop has significantly improved its cash position and reduced debt, strengthening its financial stability. Q1 results highlight material operational improvements in the cash flow, yet still a shrinking business. The company’s recent accumulation of Bitcoin puts it in a similar camp as MSTR now, vying for ""BTC yield."" Despite some positive aspects to Q1's results, I remain cautious about the long-term outlook with its crypto focus. When I covered GameStop ( GME ) last August, I spoke to its strong cash position, as well as, efforts to eliminate debt and mitigate cash burn in its surviving brick-and-mortar retail business. Impressively, GME has made material improvements, visible in Q1's results that came out on Tuesday. Curiously, the accumulation of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is a new part of this story. In fact, it may just be the story now. Given the development, the premium to book value, and the trickiness in finding a discount for a soon-to-be crypto portfolio, I rate the stock a Hold. Summary of Previous Thesis Last time, I talked about the situation with GameStop's declining, brick-and-mortar business. Screenshot from previous thesis While revenue decline had stabilized, GameStop still had a cash burn problem. With the 2021 short squeeze providing essential capital, they were able to retire their debt and shift from interest expense to some interest income off of the $1 billion they had leftover. Ultimately, I concluded: The fundamentals show a tale of decline, and there's no obvious strategy to steer this company toward sustainable, positive cash flows. Unless a huge discount opens the door to some cigar-butt investing, I don't see GME being investable. Q1's Financial Results The first thing to mention with GameStop's Q1 2025 results is that they achieved free cash flow, compared to the prior-year quarter. Cash Flow Statement (Q1 2025 Earnings Release) This was achieved by finally generating positive operating cash flows. Generally speaking, this would be a sign that the ship has righted itself. Balance Sheet (Q1 2025 Earnings Release) For example, much of this simply entails monetization of inventories, which were also down YoY. Similarly, not the rise in assets held for sale. GameStop is continuing to shrink the business, selling its weaker assets to reduce cost, such as all of those in Canada . Balance Sheet (Q1 2025 Earnings Release) This is further evidenced by the YoY decline in property & equipment, as well as lease right-of-use assets. While the cash flow statement alone suggests free cash flow in the range of $600M to $700M is possible annually, this isn't sustainable for a retailer with a shrinking balance sheet of inventories and retail locations. Some may also have noticed that cash grew from the $1B I mentioned last time to over $6.3B currently. Obviously, this level of cash flow didn't create that much extra. The increase mostly owes itself to ATM offerings that occurred later in 2024, and that is something that deserves its own focus. Capital Raises and Bitcoin While the company made a series of ATM equity offerings over the last several months, the intentions for these offerings were not clear, merely described as being for general corporate purposes, such as acquisitions and investments. In March, their intentions to purchase BTC were announced, with a confirmation in the link I provided earlier indicated that 4,710 BTC had been purchased. BTC 6M Price History (Seeking Alpha) They did not disclose their cost basis per BTC, and this was not disclosed with Q1 results, as it occurred in the second quarter. Market prices at the time suggest that as much as $490M was spent on this, indicating that much more cash exists for future purchases. Cash Flow Statement (Q1 2025 Earnings Release) One thing that does appear is cash raised from a private convertible debt offering . The issue bears no interest, effectively an equity investment with the principal recoverable to the investor. The announcement came with more clear intentions than the ATM offerings of 2024: purchase of BTC. As this was only about a third of the offering, it stands to reason that more yet will be purchased. MSTR Q1 2025 Presentation This is a technique we've seen elsewhere. Strategy ( MSTR ), under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has developed the method of using his company's own stock as a form of leverage to purchase BTC, in order to generate enhanced returns that he calls ""BTC yield."" The slide above describes the use of convertible issues to accomplish this. MSTR Q1 2025 Presentation Strategy even seems to have given GameStop an official nod for doing so, acknowledging them in their Q1 2024 investor presentation. I've covered MSTR as well. In my February thesis (titled, It Just Doesn't Make Sense ) I questioned the reasoning behind this approach. With MSTR trading at a premium to its BTC portfolio's value, I wondered why investors looking for crypto would purchase it, instead of the BTC outright. While I can kind of see the argument from Strategy's perspective, using their equity as a form of leverage, this also just adding to the risk of holding BTC. In that piece, I concluded: Without a source of earnings...to support this BTC accumulation, it's not clear why those who believe in BTC would aim for MSTR instead of buying the BTC directly. It just doesn't make sense to me. While GameStop does have earnings, for now, in the form of free cash flow, it seems increasingly likely that this won't last, and so the thesis for GME is effectively the same as that of MSTR now. Valuation With that said, we're looking at a market cap of about $13B for $30 per share recently. This compares to a balance sheet with common equity of about $6.5B, if we ignore the convertible debt balance and just assume it converts. Fully diluted, therefore, book value per share should be about $13. Similar to MSTR, GME trades at a premium to its balance sheet, which will soon consist of BTC holdings to a large degree, without any indications that organic earnings will grow to contribute to this upside. That isn't saying that earnings growth won't occur, but if one takes the assets plus potential earnings, I think the best we can say is that GME is fairly valued. There's not a discount before with these financials. Conclusion When I wrote last year, I didn't expect GME to start mimicking the peculiar approach of Michael Saylor, but I guess it's another thing to make 2025 an interesting year. Even if they achieve ""BTC yield"" exactly as Saylor has for MSTR, growth is priced in, and folks believing in Bitcoin (and wanting the benefit of its liquidity) might just do better buying it directly. For that reason, I consider GME a Hold.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794054-gamestop-positive-cash-flows-andbitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","GME",cryptocompare

Dubbed Bitcoin Core 30, the upgrade removes the long-standing 80-byte OP_RETURN limit , allowing up to 4MB of data to be embedded in transactions. Supporters say this change improves how Bitcoin handles metadata, enabling use cases like NFTs and tokenized documents to be directly on-chain. Critics, however, worry that the move undermines Bitcoin’s original ethos as a peer-to-peer monetary system and fear it could accelerate network bloat, leading to further centralization. NEW: Bitcoin Core devs are shaking up the scene, pushing for a bold OP_RETURN data storage limit increase to 4MB by October. This hot topic's sparked a fiery debate among the Bitcoin fam. Brace for impact! Source: https://t.co/SKYPJE9u3O — Web Weavers (@WebWeaversHub) June 10, 2025 While developer Gloria Zhao argues the update formalizes what miners are already doing, detractors claim the change lacks sufficient consensus. One community member went so far as to call it “a disgraceful precedent,” citing inadequate transparency and stakeholder involvement. Whether it’s an innovation or a deviation remains to be seen, but the October fork is now locked in, and the market is watching closely. Bitcoin Technical Setup Supports $112K Breakout Despite the controversy, the Bitcoin price prediction remains resilient, as BTC is currently trading at $109,717, up 0.04% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $2.18 trillion and a volume of over $52.9 billion.

Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Price recently bounced off $108,910, a key horizontal level, and is now consolidating below the $110,568 resistance. The MACD indicator is flat but not bearish, while neutral candlesticks suggest the price is coiling ahead of a breakout. If price clears $110,568 with substantial volume, targets include: $112,000 : Next resistance in the current range $113,500 : Upper boundary of the ascending channel On the downside, losing $108,900 could open room for a drop to $106,960. Until then, bulls remain in control of the trend. Long-Term Metrics Reinforce Bullish Outlook Market internals paint a more robust picture. Realized capitalization, a key measure of long-term holder conviction, reached an all-time high of $934.88 billion on June 7, despite prices ranging between $102,000 and $106,000. This suggests that long-term investors are accumulating, rather than selling, even in the face of policy uncertainty. Bitcoin Hits $110K, Altcoins Surge, and Regulatory Moves Shape Crypto Landscape On June 10, 2025, the crypto market is buzzing!

Conclusion Bitcoin’s upcoming Core 30 upgrade is dividing opinion but not derailing price. The technical setup is bullish, long-term investors are holding, and market inflows remain strong. If Bitcoin clears $110,568, a run toward $113,500 is well within reach, even with October’s fork looming.

Currently, FUNToken trades for around $0.00345, and with analysts suggesting it could potentially pump all the way to $0.10 by the end of 2025. It has an active utility, solid fundamentals, and a growing community in the world of online gaming and blockchain entertainment. Investor sentiment around FUNToken is increasingly bullish, positioning it as a key focus in the crypto market. In this article, we’ll look at everything you need to know about FUNToken, including its technical information, the potential rise to the moon, market positioning, analyst predictions, and the important roadmap events that may drive it to further adoption. Background on FUNToken What is FUNToken? FUNToken is a utility token that will power interactions in the ecosystem of decentralized gaming, including participating in specific online casinos, online gaming, and confluence opportunities in gaming platforms. FUNToken is an ERC-20 asset on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning it has access to the security, decentralization, and advancements of Ethereum yet has a modern technology stack. Use Case and Ecosystem FUNToken’s main use case is the hosting of online casinos, skill games, and DeFi platforms. FUNToken has several use cases within the FunFair ecosystem. Users can use FUNToken to buy services at the casinos, place bets, and earn rewards. Another important part of the FUNToken ecosystem is the XFUN Wallet. XFUN Wallet allows users to swap FUN to XFUN (on a 1:1 basis), allowing players to game uninterrupted. The swapping idea will keep the FUNToken’s supply constantly decreasing, as the FUNToken supply comes from FUNTokens that are circulating, which will lead to FUNToken scarcity over time. Which Platform Is FUNToken Used On? FUNToken is the native cryptocurrency of the FunFair blockchain platform, an Ethereum-based decentralized gaming ecosystem that is revolutionizing iGaming. FunFair aims to create a transparent and fair gaming experience using the benefits of blockchain technology. Additionally, FunFair is utilizing the protocols of the Polygon Network to lower transaction fees while increasing transaction speeds. Tokenomics Max Supply : 17 billion FUN Circulating Supply : Approx. 10.96 billion FUN Quarterly Burn Protocol : 50% of profits in FUN are burned every quarter to reduce supply. This model aligns incentives across developers and token holders by supporting deflationary pressure while increasing token utility. Community and Updates FUNToken’s AI-powered Telegram community has officially crossed 30,000 members—marking a major milestone. Join now to stay updated on real-time discussions, project announcements, and ecosystem developments. More growth, more utility, more $FUN ahead: https://t.me/officialFUNToken Recent Analyst Predictions In 2025, there has been considerable interest from analysts in the crypto space around FUNToken. Based on the projection of CoinMarketCap , FUNToken could see a large jump, which anticipates that it will end in the price range between $0.0041 and $0.0062 by the end of 2025. There are some independent market analysts on X (formerly Twitter) and crypto communities on CoinCodex that are indicating even longer price forecasts for FUNToken, targeting a future price as high as $0.33. This is based on expected adoption from exponentially growing users, use in gaming, and continuous burn of the FUNToken. These strong price predictions all stem from the technical indicators, on-chain metrics, and the future upside of the market. There is good reason for the strong outlook, as there are bullish influences, including the amount of daily transactions being consistent and growing, increasing interest by various wallets, new staking activity, and a strong burn protocol. Analysts are seeing an overall bullish sentiment coming back to the altcoin space, and FUNToken is highly likely to carry forward being in the position it is, specifically FUNToken’s unique offering in online gaming. Historical Price Trends To assess FUNToken’s potential for the future, a review of its movements in the past is necessary. FUNToken saw an all-time high (ATH) of about $0.19 in January 2018 as a result of the 2017 bull run and the hype of blockchain-based games. After the ATH, FUNToken experienced a very sharp decline, leading to an All-Time Low (ATL) of around $0.001 in March 2020 after the COVID-driven market crash. In April 2025, FUNToken saw an interesting upward spike to $0.0089, signaling renewed interest in FUNToken as it appears to start trading upward after the memorable decline. In the past, FUNToken has been highly sensitive in relation to the greater crypto markets, especially Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) movements. During bull cycles, FUN will typically experience sharp upward spikes, and during bear trends, suppress the development and growth. Given Bitcoin’s current considerations for entering a new bull phase, FUNToken should experience similar correlated growth through renewed interest and activity for gaming-related tokens. Technical Analysis The technical indicators for FUNToken are presently conveying a broadly positive outlook, albeit with some caution. Its support level is currently traded at around $0.0030, while its key resistance is presently at $0.0050. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is presently at 55.58, which indicates a neutral position, neither overbought or oversold—a position where upward movement is possible. Buying volume seems to be increasing, which is overall a positive sign. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is currently at $0.0032, and the 200-day SMA is currently at around $0.0045. If for whatever reason it crosses above that value, it would be indicative of bullish tendencies known as a “golden cross.” The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) just turned positive recently, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line, which is a positive momentum indicator. In the last few weeks, the trading volume indicated an increase amongst interested investors. While there has not been complete disclosure of whale wallet movements recently, there are indications of accumulation via large transactions. On-Chain and Fundamental Data: Growing Ecosystem and Strategic Developments On-chain metrics reveal important insights about FUNToken’s usability and growth potential. Metrics can show whether the FUNToken ecosystem is healthy and active. One of the most exciting things to see would be the increase in active wallets holding FUNToken. The growth of wallet addresses suggests increasing user adoption, which is arguably the most important part of building community and token utility. More users engaging with FUNToken will lead to more transactions and activity in the ecosystem, demonstrating that FUNToken is usable in a real-world situation rather than just being a speculative instrument. As of 2025, FUNToken’s ecosystem, which includes the Ethereum network for its mainnet and the XFUN token on the Polygon network, has more than 253,000 active users. A very positive achievement that shows real adoption and engagement from a large user base. Just in the mainnet, FUNToken has about 85,000 unique holders, which shows a wide pool of token holders and is still growing. Daily transactions have also shown an upward trend, suggesting that FUNToken is actively used within its gaming ecosystem. Notably, this increase in transaction volume is primarily driven from gaming-related activity where players spend FUN on in-game payments, rewards, and swapping FUN with XFUN. The XFUN token, which sits on the Polygon blockchain, has provided FUNToken with better interoperability and scalability features, which provide faster and less costly transactions, therefore improving the overall experience. One particularly noteworthy feature of FUNToken is its quarterly burn mechanism. Each quarter required by contract is where they take 50% of the profit earned in FUN and burn it. Burning means that these tokens will never return to circulation. The burn protocol’s increasing scarcity over time has added a catalyst to the supply reduction while putting back tokens, which increases holder confidence and the long-term value. In terms of price action, FUNToken’s 24-hour trading volume is at $3,228,380, though it did suffer a minor decrease in volume of 7.10% from the previous day. Given this short-term decrease, this liquidity volume means that there is still fairly healthy market interest, especially since FUNToken has such a specific niche in gaming. For investors and traders, sufficient liquidity provides an avenue to make trades and provides opportunities for them to enter and exit, which is substantial for a healthy market. Broader Market Sentiment Here’s a breakdown of the key factors influencing this sentiment: Market Set for Stabilization and Mild Bullish Trends: Bitcoin and other leading altcoins are just beginning their consolidation and potential bullish trend after a number of volatile years. The period of set stabilization brings on renewed investor confidence. Considering Bitcoin as the Evaluation of a Broader Market: Bitcoin remains historically the biggest judge for the larger crypto market; generally speaking, the bullish trend of BTC will find altcoins like FUNToken benefiting from desperate investor interest and market optimism. Investor Confidence and Innovation: Being bullish on Bitcoin is a sign of confidence, promoting curiosity and investment in innovative projects, including gaming tokens like FUNToken that marry blockchain and entertainment. Impact of Global Macroeconomic Factors: Some external influences that affect crypto sentiment are as follows: – Regulatory clarity and changes to cryptocurrency laws – Whether crypto ETFs are approved or rejected – Interest rate changes and economic circumstances – Mainstream institutions looking intensively at blockchain technology Favorable Regulation and Institutional Adoption: Clearer regulations and mainstream institutional exploration help legitimize the crypto industry, so that would add to positive sentiment and funnel quality capital into projects that have promise, such as FUNToken. Scalability and Technological Advancements: It’s certainly fertile ground with improvements in blockchain scalability and the emergence of DeFi protocols, especially those that concern themselves with gaming ecosystems. Potential Triggers for FUNToken’s Surge Several significant catalysts could provide a meaningful kick for FUNToken’s price: New Games: 10 Mobile-Game Releases Scheduled for Q2-2025, Many More to Follow Into the Subsequent Quarters. So-called commercialization would be directly accompanied by the need for FUNToken (i.e., in-game currency and rewards). Wallet/Ecosystem Improvements: A web-based wallet for FUN is set to launch alongside a staking-enabled mobile wallet (with rewards) for users, thus covering the best user experience to enjoy further mass adoption. Buy-and-Burn Program: The launch of the highest buy-and-burn scheme is expected very soon, further minimizing the supply of FUNToken. Notwithstanding, this may likely provide a price move to the upside owing to scarcity concerns—and that is particularly before the full buy-and-burn comes into completion, whereby it will absorb all the FUN at strategic buybacks alongside post-FUNTM token buybacks. Partnerships: Through collaborations with third-party gaming platforms and DeFi settings, FUNToken will directly build more utility outside the FunFair ecosystem. Exchange Listings: Listing on bigger cryptocurrency exchanges increases liquidity and accessibility, drawing new investors. Marketing Campaigns: Marketing and community outreach programs will further increase awareness and draw users towards FUNToken. What’s Next? The detailed roadmap for 2025-2026 is ambitious: Q2 2025: Release 10 mobile games on Android and iOS, build a web-based FUN wallet, and have account login across games and officially launch the “Earn-While-You-Play” initiative. Q3 2025: Introduce 10 more casual games, reach over 1 million players and 100,000 wallets, implement achievement systems, begin buy-and burn token mechanics, and conduct first partnership with an external party. Q4 2025: Scale up to 30 games, achieve 5 million players, 500,000 wallets used, launch mobile FUN wallet with staking and rewards, release NFTs and leaderboards, and onboard external studios. Q1 2026: Expand to 40 games that span a variety of categories, hit 10 million players and 1 million wallets, add multi-chain and fiat support, add FUN into external metaverses, and host the first Global FUN Gaming Summit. The Bottom Line FUNToken is at an exciting point in 2025. It has the backing of a strong team, a solid use case in the gaming sector, strong tokenomics (which include a deflationary burn mechanism), and an expanding ecosystem. FUNToken has many variables in place to put it in a position to grow. The technicals and historical trends indicate that there will be a positive trend, as the on-chain data and increasing wallet activity show that adoption is indeed starting to kick in, not to mention the broader market sentiment is in a bullish trend. New product launches and pending announcements of partnerships & marketing are likely to trigger throngs of new retail investor interest, leading to higher prices. For crypto investors who want exposure to gaming-related blockchain assets, FUNToken presents a strong opportunity for innovation, utility, and growth!

2025-06-11T13:21:08,"Bloomberg Analyst Explains: ""Get Ready for the Altcoin ETF Summer! This Altcoin Will Be the First to Get Approval!""","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is postponing ETF applications for altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA) one by one. As the market eagerly awaits which altcoin ETF will be approved after Bitcoin and Ethereum, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart predicted that Solana could be the first altcoin to receive approval for a spot ETF. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also noted that there could be an upcoming Altcoin ETF Summer led by Solana. At this point, Eric Balchunas said that mass approval for altcoin ETFs is highly likely this summer. However, Balchunas said that he does not have high expectations regarding inflows into altcoin ETFs. He stated that unlike Bitcoin, the scale of capital inflow into altcoin ETFs will not be large. “Get ready for an Altcoin ETF Summer that is likely to be led by Solana (and some basket products). “Altcoin ETFs may attract some funds, but the scale is hard to predict. But it won't be at the same level as Bitcoin (BTC).” The race for new ETF launches is heating up and “basket products are going to get more interesting” as more asset managers enter the space, Duncan Moir, chairman of ETF issuer 21Shares, told a conference in Paris. According to Bloomberg Intelligence data, the probability of approval for the Solana ETF is set at 90%, followed by Litecoin at 90% and XRP at 85%. Dogecoin follows at 80%, while other altcoin ETFs such as Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera (HBAR) and Avalanche (AVAX) are estimated to have a 75% chance of getting the green light. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T13:17:54,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Bitcoin Predicted To Be ‘Hedge’ To The Rise Of AI","While most of the community has shown deep interest in the merger of AI and cryptocurrencies, as evident by the emergence of AI agent cryptos, there are some analysts who are weaving a different narrative. Dario Amodei, the CEO of AI firm Anthropic, has said that it is clear AI will end up wiping out most of the entry-level jobs. ""Artificial Intelligence may wipe out 50% of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next 5 years,"" he said in an interview with Forbes . Echoing this sentiment is Strive Asset Management CEO Matt Cole, who said that it is possible that half of the companies in the S&P 500 may disappear as AI continues to cause market disruption. To protect oneself from this oncoming storm, Cole added, one should consider hedging with Bitcoin. Statements like these will likely garner more support for Bitcoin. And those who want a cheaper alternative may look for the best crypto to buy now on the altcoin side of the aisle. AI Emergence Could Lead to History Repeating Itself – Matt Cole Citing the era when the internet emerged, Matt Cole said that the fast-internet disruption wiped out roughly 50% of the companies that were among the S&P 500 by the time 2020 arrived. Giving an interview to a popular crypto news outlet, Matt Cole said, ""We obviously had the rise of all these tech stars, but what’s often not talked about is that from a period of 1990 to 2020, over half the companies in the S&P 500 fell out of the S&P 500; they got replaced."" The words of Matt Cole hold true, as AI adoption has led to people being laid off in many companies over the past two years. Onclusive, a company that specialized in media monitoring, made news in 2023 by laying off more than 200 employees after French law allowed employers to justify job cuts by introducing artificial intelligence. Failed AI adoption has even caused companies to shut down. For instance, Forward, a healthcare startup in the US, had to wind down its CarePods clinics after laying off many employees due to AI operations and then failing to scale those operations. Such stories justify Matt Cole's rationale that companies should add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, since that's what is going to make them future-proof. And as far as trends go, most companies have already taken preemptive steps. Strategy's name has become almost synonymous with Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor as its prophet. Japan's MetaPlanet is now rushing through Bitcoin adoption with its $555 million plan, and even GameStop, once the famed game retail ecosystem, is now venturing into Bitcoin . Bitcoin Could Work as a Symbolic Hedge Against AI The adoption of artificial intelligence could help reshape financial power. Central banks have started to deploy it, and Big Tech companies have begun to adopt it. However, there is something to be said about the rising infrastructure and energy costs from AI systems. For instance, MIT Technology Review recently highlighted that AI models use about 3.4 million joules. And when it comes to layoffs, there is major public backlash, which could reduce positive sentiment around a company, leading to a drop in its value. In this scenario, Bitcoin could provide a parallel business strategy. Holding BTC could be considered digital insurance, acting as a hedge against inflation. This could be seen as a way of ""increasing freedom of value ownership at a time when AI is trying hard to reduce human relevance when it comes to production."" Therefore, yes, Bitcoin could work as a hedge in the new era where AI-driven operations are taking charge. This means the entire crypto ecosystem as a whole has become more appealing. Best Crypto to Buy Now Here are the top cryptos that could be the best ones to buy given the current conversation around AI: SUBBD While Bitcoin is being considered a good option as a hedge in an AI-driven economy, another possible option would be a crypto that has AI tech built in. It could be considered a way to stay ahead of the curve. And one of the most lucrative among them right now is SUBBD . Described by the official website as an AI agent ecosystem, SUBBD is an AI agent platform focused on content creation. Modeled after OnlyFans, this ecosystem focuses on AI-driven tools to let content creators automate content management and even develop custom content according to the needs of their subscribers. An additional focus of this project is on redefining fan-creator interaction, which involves using a prompt-like ecosystem to let creators and their fans develop content together. Gamified perks have also been added inside SUBBD, with XP multipliers that unlock exclusive content. Content sharing is also encouraged on the platform, allowing even fans to generate income. The project has already onboarded over 2,000 creators who have a cumulative following of over 250 million across multiple social media platforms. And since the project is so inclined towards social media platforms, it also invites users to go to Instagram to get the full SUBBD experience. Want the full $SUBBD experience? Find us on Instagram for everything else you're missing out on 🔥♥️SUBBDHoneys / SUBBDOfficial pic.twitter.com/CU4sKEijfr — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) June 10, 2025 Over $650K has been raised by this project so far, and those wanting to join can do so at a discounted price of $0.55 per token. Bitcoin Bitcoin adoption has become extremely fast thanks to the influx of institutional investors. Many are bullish that it could even reach the $1 million mark in the coming days. Therefore, it makes sense for people to add BTC to their portfolios, especially since the current price action primes it to climb to new highs by the end of June. Bitcoin is currently trading around the $109K level. The latest red candle has been the result of a small pullback due to short positions being closed. However, the hourly chart shows that the recent downturn could lead to an upswing, with BTC price retesting the $110K mark. A successful breakout above this resistance level could lead to a parabolic move up, where the BTC price could retest its all-time high again, potentially clearing the path for it to reach $120K. BTC Bull Bitcoin being perceived as a hedge against inflation and even AI-driven development could give the apex crypto enough boost that its growth could spill over into similar assets with unique spins. BTC Bull is a Bitcoin-inspired meme coin that could be considered an asset similar to Bitcoin but with a meme-driven quirk that makes it a good buy for short-term investors. This meme coin, which features a bull clad in a commando outfit as the main figure, focuses on generating buzz about Bitcoin through memes and at the same time has mechanics that could give its own value a major boost. Send it higher. ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/BINtGVGNNU — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 5, 2025 These mechanics are token burns and Bitcoin airdrops, with the former tapping into the supply-demand mechanic to gain ground in the market and the latter focusing on offering ""free Bitcoin"" to $BTC Bull holders. Both these mechanics will trigger when Bitcoin hits a certain level. On the surface, it establishes an almost symbiotic relationship between Bitcoin and BTC Bull. Bitcoin's growth could lead to BTC Bull making an explosive jump on the price chart, and the profits could make people wealthy enough to buy more Bitcoin, leading to the BTC price increasing further. While this narrative has a touch of wishful thinking, it is enough to rally meme coin investors to gather in support. And it is this narrative that has led crypto analysts such as Crypto ZIP to highlight positive aspects of the project. The analyst believes BTC Bull could become the next crypto to explode following Bitcoin's jump. Bitcoin Hyper With Bitcoin Hyper , the focus is to transform Bitcoin into more than just an asset designed as a ""store of value."" The official website marks Bitcoin Hyper as the world's first L2 solution for Bitcoin that will use off-chain transactions to inject scalability, speed, and efficiency into the Bitcoin network. This is an ambition of tall order, and one that many projects have attempted before. However, Bitcoin Hyper is a bit different, since the technical details mentioned in the whitepaper make the entire prospect of improving Bitcoin look more legitimate. As popular crypto analyst Cilinix Crypto states, ""It looks like Bitcoin Hyper is actually trying to provide something unique."" The meme coin project's utility-centric infrastructure is underscored by three technical factors: L2 scaling solution, Solana Virtual Machine, and a Canonical Bridge. Working in tandem, they reportedly form the foundation of an ecosystem that could transform the Bitcoin network into a host for decentralized applications, NFTs, and more. While these could potentially add to the long-term value of Bitcoin Hyper, the short-term perks could stem from Bitcoin Hyper's unique imagery. This one turns Pepe into the Flash, which is used to highlight a faster, better, and more utility-focused Bitcoin. Summary Bitcoin's growing relevance in a world where AI tech is creating layoffs and, at times, shutting companies down does make the apex crypto look like a good buy. Companies should consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. However, retail investors should also take the market's volatility into account and explore other assets if they are searching for the best crypto to buy now. The right crypto alongside Bitcoin could help investors find safer ground during uncertain times. And while Bitcoin Hyper and BTC Bull are meme coins at their core, they do have interesting attributes that could create a community strong enough to sustain their value in the long term.

2025-06-11T13:15:56,"Connecticut bans Bitcoin investment and tightens crypto laws","Connecticut has drawn a clear line in the sand on digital asset investment by passing House Bill 7082 , which formally prohibits the state from investing in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The new law , enacted on Tuesday without a single opposing vote in either the House or Senate, also prevents the creation of a state-held Bitcoin reserve. With the bill now in effect, Connecticut becomes the latest state to harden its stance on crypto amid a wave of divergent strategies emerging across the United States. Crypto risk disclosures and money transmission laws get a revamp As part of the newly adopted legislation, Connecticut has also revised its money transmission framework to reflect the evolving digital finance landscape. Under the updated rules, crypto firms involved in money transmission must disclose all material risks associated with using crypto assets. This move is designed to ensure that both individual and institutional users are fully aware of the speculative and volatile nature of digital currencies before engaging with these platforms. In addition, the law introduces mandatory verification of legal guardians for users under the age of 18. This provision seeks to add a layer of protection for minors interacting with crypto services, reflecting a growing push in various jurisdictions to implement age-specific safeguards. The bill’s passage underscores a broader commitment by state lawmakers to shield public finances from the risks of highly volatile assets. The law also signals that crypto regulations in the state will likely become more stringent going forward, especially in the areas of consumer protection and institutional oversight. Connecticut breaks away from Bitcoin reserve trend Over the past year, 27 US states have explored or proposed legislation to create strategic Bitcoin reserves, with the idea gaining traction in some quarters as a hedge against inflation or as a long-term investment. Texas, New Hampshire, and Arizona have all passed state-level Bitcoin reserve measures, making Connecticut’s outright rejection a notable departure from the trend. Texas, in particular, has been vocal about its strategy. With a sizeable budget surplus, it sees Bitcoin as a “forward-thinking” addition to a diversified investment portfolio. The Texas Blockchain Council has promoted the idea that Bitcoin could serve as a modern-day store of value, aligning with the state’s investment philosophy. The move has drawn attention from crypto advocates and policy watchers alike, especially as it diverges from the federal government’s more measured approach. By contrast, Connecticut’s new law draws a definitive line against using taxpayer funds to bet on what some lawmakers continue to view as an unpredictable and unproven asset class. This legislative stance may influence other risk-averse states still weighing their options amid volatile market behaviour. Federal stance adds complexity to state-level divide At the federal level, President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order aimed at establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States. However, the order has yet to be followed by detailed implementation plans, and traders have shown little enthusiasm so far. While the move was meant to signal support for digital assets at a national level, the lack of clarity has left markets unmoved and raised questions about the coherence of US crypto policy. Meanwhile, several states that initially showed interest in Bitcoin reserves have since walked back their proposals. Florida, Wyoming, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, North Dakota, and Oklahoma have all shelved or abandoned similar crypto bills this year. Their withdrawal reflects mounting concerns over Bitcoin’s price swings, regulatory uncertainty, and its suitability as a reserve asset within government portfolios. Connecticut’s decision to legislate a ban rather than merely opt out may indicate a shift toward firmer policy boundaries in states with cautious fiscal outlooks. As national and sub-national governments continue to diverge on digital asset strategy, investors, companies, and residents will need to navigate an increasingly fragmented regulatory map.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out.

Early in the month, LINK began recovering from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a key neckline at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has struggled to sustain its position near this neckline, pulling back toward the support level of the rounded bottom. But, in June this week, the LINK has risen by taking support from the structure, which strongly aligns with the multi-year support zone near $13. The continuation of this short-term price advance would require a break and a daily close above the $18 neckline. As this could indicate a potential upward move, with LINK targeting a retest of the $24 resistance level in June, an area supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. Should LINK break past the $24 mark, forecasts for late 2025 suggest the token could climb as high as $32.

2025-06-11T13:00:36,"$13.9m Raised as Tech Preview Sends PEP-20 Parabolic—June’s Hottest Crypto","The post $13.9m Raised as Tech Preview Sends PEP-20 Parabolic—June’s Hottest Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme ICO on Bitcoin, a layer 2 with Solana attributes but also the hardcoded safety of Bitcoin underneath. With over $13.9m raised and counting, the presale is selling out fast. Initially slated for a 31 st May listing, the team has pushed the date to secure more Tier 1 exchange partnerships and ensure a high-impact, fully coordinated CEX debut. Over $500K was raised on June 1 alone following the announcement. Furthermore, the team recently released a technical preview that captivated the community, showcasing the Bitcoin Pepe L2 explorer, a native BTC bridge, and an elegant DEX user interface. This could be the last time BPEP is available at only $0.0396. Stay plugged in via the official website for the latest drops and updates. June’s hottest crypto: Tech preview sends Bitcoin Pepe presale to the moon The Bitcoin Pepe team has presented the world with its first comprehensive glimpse, showcasing features that retail traders have long envisioned. The leaks show a clean and responsive BTC bridge, a native DEX interface, and a full-featured blockchain explorer tracking millions of transactions and thousands of addresses. The bridge interface signals interoperability and cross-chain flows. The DEX preview hints at lightning-fast meme trading that would feel native on any major alt L1. BPEP is a rallying flag for a new type of builder on Bitcoin. This is the beginning of something way bigger than just another meme run; it’s the foundation of a Bitcoin-powered culture layer that could redefine crypto’s most viral vertical. Bitcoin Pepe is doing what every meme project before it failed to do—build real tech first, then let the culture take it viral. The team is raising expectations significantly with these previews. If this is the only information they’re revealing, what else could they potentially have in store? BPEP price prediction: Why this could 100x post-launch Meme coins usually slap themselves onto whatever chain is available. Bitcoin, until now, was never that chain; it wasn’t fast enough, flexible enough, or fun enough. But Bitcoin Pepe changes that with Solana-style functionality layered on BTC’s unmatched security. Insiders suggest Bitcoin Pepe is close to locking in several high-profile exchange deals. These top-tier CEX partnerships are what send tokens soaring at launch, and BPEP is planning a coordinated boom. Now, the team has released four internal UI shots that clearly illustrate the progress of the project. The bridge is clean and already operational. It’s the key to moving assets from Bitcoin into BPEP’s faster layer. The explorer is live and responsive. You can trace activity on-chain without guessing if your transaction even went through. If you’ve ever been stuck refreshing Etherscan, this is a relief. Taken together, this is a network that’s already coming online. Bitcoin Pepe is teaming with Web3 games like Crypto Hunters , DeFi powerhouses like Catamoto , and fair launch platforms like Super Meme . These partnerships are how BPEP gets stickier, more liquid, and useful beyond trading. With Solana-like performance and BTC’s liquidity, security, and global reach, the 100x target doesn’t sound so crazy after all. Don’t miss the trade after the trade For years, meme coins have been bolted onto chains that weren’t built for them. But right now, Bitcoin Pepe is building Solana on Bitcoin , a fully fledged layer 2 made for retail. With a huge 17th June reveal locked in and tier 1 exchange deals cooking in the background, BPEP looks like one of the biggest post-launch runs in crypto this year. From the BTC bridge to the DEX and explorer, the leaks are proving that Bitcoin Pepe is building real tech and building it fast. With $13.9m raised and the presale still live at only $0.0396, time is running out for early positioning.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/13-9m-raised-as-tech-preview-sends-pep-20-parabolic-junes-hottest-crypto/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING|ZRX","Information",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T13:00:02,"Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears","Bitcoin’s price outlook remains sky-high after Strategy founder Michael Saylor told Bloomberg on Tuesday that a market freeze won’t come back. He argued that growing demand and limited daily supply point straight to a rally toward $1 million. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Supply And Demand Pressure According to Saylor, miners release only about 450 BTC each day. That adds up to roughly $50 million at today’s price of around $109,859. He said once that $50 million is snapped up by buyers, there’s no choice but for the price to climb. His view rests on the idea that active demand now matches or exceeds what miners sell. High Price Targets Based on reports, asset manager ARK Invest recently boosted its bull case for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. Saylor went even further. He said that as long as Bitcoin doesn’t head to zero, it’s bound for $1 million. His own firm has picked up 582,000 BTC since 2020. That stash is worth nearly $64 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. Institutional And Political Support Saylor pointed to big names backing Bitcoin. He mentioned US President Donald Trump, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and SEC chair Paul Atkins as signs that the asset has won its toughest battles. He also noted that banks are lining up to offer custody services. And he praised Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and others for buying coins daily. Volatility Warning Saylor didn’t shy away from a cautionary note. He suggested that if Bitcoin hits $500,000 or $1 million, a fall to about $200,000 could follow. That’s almost a 60% drop from the peak. His point was that big price swings are part of Bitcoin’s history—and likely its future. Beyond miner sales and whale wallets, analysts say wider market moves matter too. Spot and futures trading often top $10 billion a day, so $50 million of fresh buys might only nudge the price. Regulation could swing the other way if concerns over energy use or consumer protection grow. And rival cryptocurrencies keep popping up with new features. Related Reading: Owning 10,000 XRP? You’re Among Crypto’s Elite, Expert Claims What Comes Next Reports disclose the real test will be whether steady new buyers can outpace both miner supply and selling by holders looking to bank profits. Saylor’s figures make a strong case for continued upside. But investors who build a plan around a $1 million Bitcoin should brace for big dips along the way. In the end, daily demand, political moves and how the rest of the financial world reacts will decide if those eye-popping targets really come to pass.

Any “necessary rare earths” will be supplied by China 4. Rare earths to be supplied upfront by China 5. US to allow Chinese students to attend US… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 11, 2025 Despite the announcement, the term “total of 55% tariffs” for the US remains rather vague, and investors are still waiting for further details. The deal, reached only two days after talks began in London on Monday, is now only subject to approval by Chinese President Xi Jinping and the POTUS, who appears rather satisfied with the terms. In other, somewhat related news, the US CPI data for May went live, showing lower than expected numbers. The annual inflation rate is at 2.4% and a minor 0.1% increase for the month. According to CNBC, this suggests that the tariffs are not significantly impacting the US economy, as many had feared, at least for now. BTC’s price reacted almost immediately to the two developments and went from roughly $109,000 to nearly $110,000 within minutes.

2025-06-11T12:50:39,"Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Surge to $1M, Dismissing Fears of Crypto Winter","Bitcoin advocate and Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has once again voiced bold optimism about the future of the world’s largest cryptocurrency, declaring that the era of crypto market winters is over. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Saylor said Bitcoin is poised for significant growth, projecting it could reach $1 million in value as adoption rises and supply tightens. “Winter is not coming back,” Saylor stated confidently. “We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” Bitcoin Demand Outpaces Miner Supply Saylor explained a key market dynamic driving his bullish outlook: limited daily supply versus surging institutional demand. According to him, just 450 BTC—valued around $50 million at current prices—are introduced to the market each day by miners. As public companies and ETF providers increasingly accumulate these coins, Saylor believes upward pressure on prices is inevitable. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” he explained. His firm, Strategy, has been a major player in Bitcoin accumulation , having acquired 582,000 BTC since 2020, now worth over $63 billion. Saylor emphasized that the Bitcoin market has matured and stabilized, adding, “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” U.S. Support and Global Adoption Strengthen the Case Backing his bold prediction, Saylor pointed to growing political and institutional support for BTC in the U.S. He cited President Donald Trump’s favorable stance on crypto, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s endorsement, and signals from traditional banks moving toward offering Bitcoin custody services. He also acknowledged recent volatility, noting that Trump’s February tariffs triggered a steep decline in BTC price, but maintained that broader momentum remains strong. “Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period,” Saylor said. In addition to U.S. interest, Saylor referenced global developments, including Pakistan’s announcement of plans to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve . With countries and institutions joining the race to accumulate BTC, Saylor believes the next major phase of adoption has already begun. “If it’s not going to zero,” he reiterated, “it’s going to $1 million.” The post Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Surge to $1M, Dismissing Fears of Crypto Winter appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/michael-saylor-predicts-bitcoin-surge-to-1m-dismissing-fears-of-crypto-winter/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T12:45:35,"Ethereum's strongest run since US election leads this week's $286M crypto fund inflows","Crypto funds have attracted $286 million in weekly inflows according to CoinShares data. This extends the current streak to seven weeks with $11 billion total accumulation. Ethereum-led crypto funds saw $296.4 million in weekly inflows. It has experienced seven consecutive weeks of bullish investor sentiment. ETH-linked funds’ recent run has now extended its current inflow streak to $1.5 billion in total inflows over the same period. The week’s haul places Ethereum at 10.5% of assets under management in digital investment products. This concentration is a reflection of Ethereum’s rebound from earlier phases of diminished institutional confidence as well as regulatory uncertainty. CoinShares data marks this as Ethereum’s strongest inflow on record since the US election in November. The seven-week trend indicates sustained institutional conviction over short-term speculation as the driving force behind the deployment boost. Cash flow into crypto funds. Source: CoinShares Bitcoin faces second week of outflows amid policy uncertainty Bitcoin experienced its second consecutive week of outflows with $56.5 million, overshadowed by Ethereum’s performance in the same period. Monthly outflows for the month totaled $57 million. Policy uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve actions kept institutional investors on the sidelines and propelled Bitcoin’s adverse flow trend. Short-bitcoin products also experienced their second week in a row of outflows that reflected reduced bearish positioning by institutional investors. Although there have been net outflows in recent periods, Bitcoin still has significant assets under management at $151.2 billion of investment products. Year-to-date flows are positive at $10.1 billion. Bitcoin’s recent behavior differs from the seven-week cumulative influx trend that governs the entire cryptocurrency universe. The deviation means that investors are rotating and choosing among cryptos, but not necessarily leaving digital assets. Regional distribution shows US leadership in crypto funds The United States led global inflows with $175 million and accounted for the majority of weekly digital asset investment activity. Germany followed with $47.8 million in inflows, while Switzerland contributed $15.7 million to the positive trend. Canada and Australia rounded out the major contributors with $9.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Minor outflows were reported in Brazil at $9.2 million and Hong Kong at $14.6 million, with the latter ending a period of record inflows in the region. Altcoin activity remained subdued compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum movements. Sui had tiny inflows of $1.1 million, and XRP endured its ongoing downtrend with outflows of $6.6 million. This is the third consecutive week that investors have been taking money out of the crypto. Multi-asset products experienced $6.58 million of outflows for the week and $142.12 million year-to-date outflows. Solana experienced minimal outflows of $2.09 million, and Cardano experienced minimal outflows of $0.4 million. High activity concentration in Bitcoin and Ethereum contrasts with low altcoin movement. This suggests institutional investors want to maintain concentration on established digital assets and avoid diversifying into general crypto exposure under prevailing market conditions.

2025-06-11T12:42:07,"Bitcoin Miner IREN to Raise $450M From Convertible Debt Offering","Bitcoin BTC and AI data center operator IREN plans to raise $450 million through a private sale of convertible senior notes, the company said in a press release . The notes, due in 2029, will be offered to qualified institutional buyers and could expand by another $50 million if initial purchasers take up an optional allotment. The unsecured notes will pay semiannual interest and can be converted into IREN’s ordinary shares under certain conditions. The company has the option to redeem the notes starting in mid-2028 if its stock trades at 30% above the conversion price for a set period. IREN said it intends to use the proceeds for a pair of financial strategies meant to offset potential equity dilution and market risk. These are capped call transactions and a prepaid forward share repurchase. These hedges are designed to reduce the impact of future note conversions and may support the company’s share price by limiting the number of new shares issued. “If, however, the market price per ordinary share of IREN, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments,” the firm wrote. Earlier this year, IREN called off its bitcoin mining expansion to favor AI data centers. Its shares are down 6.8% ahead of the opening bell.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/11/bitcoin-miner-iren-to-raise-450m-from-convertible-debt-offering,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING","Markets|Iren|Note Offering|Bitcoin Miner|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T12:41:54,"U.S. CPI Data Released: Bitcoin and Stocks Stay Steady!","The post U.S. CPI Data Released: Bitcoin and Stocks Stay Steady! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has released the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May. The report shows inflation rising to 2.5% year-over-year, in line with forecasts. Despite this slight uptick, Bitcoin, stocks, and altcoins held their ground, showing no big moves. Let’s take a closer look at what this means for traders and the economy. CPI and Core CPI Numbers Confirmed The May Consumer Price Index (CPI) report revealed that inflation rose slightly compared to April, raising new concerns about the pace of economic cooling in the U.S. Meanwhile, the year-over-year (YoY) headline CPI increased to 2.5% in May, up from 2.3% in April. Similarly, Core CPI YoY, which excludes food and energy prices, ticked up to 2.9%, compared to 2.8% in the previous month. On a month-over-month (MoM) basis, the headline CPI held steady at 0.2%, while Core CPI MoM rose to 0.3%, up from 0.2% in April. These small changes might not seem like much, but they could have a big impact on where the markets go. What the Fed Will Do Next? With inflation staying moderate, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its June 12 meeting. According to the CME FedWatch Tool , the chance of a rate cut in July is now low, pushing expectations further into late 2025. Interestingly, prediction markets like Polymarket suggest there’s a 75% chance that the Fed might cut rates in 2025. Next Key Events To Watch out for? June 18 – FOMC Meeting: The Fed will decide on interest rates. Even if they hold rates steady, markets will listen closely to Fed Chair Powell’s words and the dot plot for clues about future cuts. Even if rates stay the same, Powell’s remarks will carry heavy weight. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : US Lawmakers Push Forward CLARITY Act to Define Crypto Rules for SEC and CFTC , June 12 – U.S. PPI Report: Producer prices give early signals of future consumer inflation. A cooler print might boost optimism for rate cuts. June 17 — U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes On June 17, the US will release the Import and Export Price Indexes, which track international trade prices. In April, import prices rose slightly by 0.1%. Impact on the Crypto Market If the Federal Reserve stays cautious and maintains a hawkish stance, Bitcoin could face short-term pressure. Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $109,739, showing a slight increase over the last 24 hours. Interestingly, altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are also seeing a bullish surge, with all of them trading in the green today. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The CPI rose 0.1% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economist forecasts had been for 0.2% and April's pace was 0.2%. On a year-over-year basis, the CPI climbed 2.4% against estimates for 2.5% and April's 2.3% Core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, rose 0.1% last month versus forecasts for 0.3% and 0.2% in April. Year-over-year core CPI was 2.8% versus an expected 2.9% and 2.8% in April. Markets hold to rate-cut outlook Bitcoin BTC rose about 0.6% in the moments following the news, trading at $109,800, up 0.3% over the past 24 hours. Despite continued uncertainty around inflation’s trajectory, the market remains confident that the Federal Reserve will begin easing policy later this year. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, traders are fully pricing in two rate cuts, with the first expected in September and the second in December.

Earn $7,000 Daily with Cloud Mining! BJMINING Unlocks the New Blue Ocean of Digital Assets June 11, 2025 – In a time of global economic uncertainty, investors face unprecedented challenges. The high volatility in the stock markets and geopolitical risks in the forex market have left many cautious and sidelined. Yet, the continued rise of the cryptocurrency sector—particularly Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin—is opening exciting new opportunities. BJMINING, a world-leading cloud mining platform, is helping investors chart a new course toward stable, long-term wealth. With cutting-edge technology, low entry barriers, and strong returns, BJMINING enables anyone—not just traders—to profit from crypto mining. In today’s environment, earning with BJMINING can be just as rewarding—if not more—than investing in stocks or forex. Traditional Markets: Risk and Opportunity Amid Turbulence Throughout 2025, global equity markets have been rattled by shifting trade policies and inconsistent economic data. Following a brief rally after the U.S. government paused tariffs on the EU, the markets reversed again. The Dow Jones fell 800 points in a week, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also saw steep drops. Meanwhile, the forex market remains volatile. U.S. Treasury yields surged and geopolitical tensions drove the dollar index into erratic swings, leading investors to seek safe havens and hedge against rapid price moves. Despite these challenges, some sectors are thriving. Tech stocks and crypto-related assets continue to attract capital due to their innovation and growth potential. Bitcoin, long considered “digital gold,” soared past $100,000, reinforcing its role as a hedge against uncertainty. Litecoin, known for its speed and low fees, and Dogecoin, with its vibrant community and growing market appeal, also saw renewed investor interest.

The financial committee advanced the measure with a 32-19 vote, agriculture committee passed it with a 47-6 vote. Key highlights of the CLARITY Act It aims to resolve the longstanding jurisdiction conflict among the crypto regulatory agencies of the US by redefining the responsibilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It establishes that certain crypto assets will be regulated as commodities under the CFTC, while others will remain securities and operate under the SEC. The CLARITY Act also offers limited liability protection for blockchain developers , excluding them from money transmitter regulations. It also established the disclosure, fund segregation, and conflict of interest rules to protect the investors from crypto fraud. Maintaining Decentralized Finance (DeFi), the act establishes consumer safeguards for non-custodial wallet providers and peer-to-peer crypto transactions . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Connecticut Passes Bill to Ban Bitcoin and Crypto Investments , Despite broad support CLARITY ACT faces criticism Representative Maxine Waters voiced concerns while warning that certain provisions in the bill can lead to a conflict of interest. Her comment indicated the ties between political leaders and the crypto industry. Brad Sherman stated that the bill could lead to industry bailouts and regulatory arbitrage. Former CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad called the CLARITY Act ‘complex ’ while stating that the bill has expanded confusion rather than resolving the issues of crypto regulatory ambiguity. CFTC will lead crypto regulations After becoming the primary crypto regulator, CFTC will oversee digital commodities, covering most cryptocurrencies and tokens traded on cash markets, including DeFi activities. It will mandate the activities of exchanges, brokers, and spot markets for non-security digital assets like Binance and Ethereum. It will also mandate stablecoin trade and custody on a commodity exchange, while the SEC’s role is limited to enforcing anti-fraud rules in stablecoin. What’s next? Debate and vote on the CLARITY Act After seeking approval from both committees, the CLARITY Act will proceed to the full House for votes and arguments. And if it is ultimately enacted, then it will become the first comprehensive law in the US for a crypto and digital assets regulatory framework. While the US Senate remains uncertain, the upper chamber works on enhancing digital asset law. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The CLARITY Act will clarify roles by defining “digital commodities” (under CFTC oversight, including most cryptocurrencies and DeFi spot markets) and “investment contract assets” (under SEC, focusing on how assets are sold). What are the main concerns critics have about the CLARITY Act’s provisions? Critics worry about potential conflicts of interest, regulatory arbitrage (creating minimal utility blockchains for CFTC oversight), reduced financial safeguards, and the bill’s complexity hindering effective regulation. What role will CFTC and SEC play if the CLARITY Act is enacted? The CFTC will become the primary regulator for digital commodities, overseeing exchanges and brokers. The SEC will retain authority over investment contract offerings and enforce anti-fraud rules, particularly for stablecoins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/us-lawmakers-push-forward-clarity-act-to-define-crypto-rules-for-sec-and-cftc/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB","News|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare

2025-06-11T12:12:06,"Peter Thiel-Backed Bullish Eyes IPO in ‘Confidential’ SEC Filing","The post Peter Thiel-Backed Bullish Eyes IPO in ‘Confidential’ SEC Filing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Peter Thiel-backed exchange aims to go public amid growing institutional interest and a friendlier U.S. crypto stance Bullish, the crypto exchange backed by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, has confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As investor confidence returns to the digital asset space, the timing couldn’t be more calculated, especially with President Donald Trump signaling strong support for the industry. Bullish Takes Another Shot at Going Public This isn’t Bullish’s first attempt to hit the public markets. The exchange tried to go public in 2021 through a SPAC merger, but that deal fell apart due to rising interest rates and a tougher market environment. Now, under the leadership of CEO Tom Farley, the former NYSE Group president, Bullish is making a fresh move. Investment bank Jefferies is handling the underwriting, but the company is keeping further details under wraps for now. The market conditions, however, look far more favorable than they did a few years ago. Institutional-First Crypto Exchange Launched in 2021 with a $300 million capital injection from Thiel’s Founders Fund and other top investors, Bullish was built for institutional traders rather than retail users. That focus gives it an edge in today’s maturing crypto landscape. The exchange is regulated in Gibraltar and designed to offer high-performance trading infrastructure with deep liquidity – qualities that institutions are increasingly seeking as they return to digital assets. Crypto IPOs Steal the Spotlight Recent successes make way for Bullish’s ambitions. Circle, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, raised $1.1 billion in its debut last week, soaring 167% on day one. Gemini, founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed for a U.S. listing on June 6 , while eToro hit Nasdaq under the ticker ETOR on May 14. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Extended Crypto Cycle Ahead, Says Bitwise CIO as Bitcoin Hits $110K , A Cointelegraph report from April 3 highlights crypto’s edge: tokens on major exchanges delivered an 80% average return on investment (ROI) over 180 days, outpacing Nasdaq (51%) and NYSE (54%) listings. Thiel’s Vision Meets Trump’s Crypto Push Peter Thiel has always seen Bullish as a core part of the evolving crypto revolution. Back in 2021, it was valued at $9 billion, and its institutional-grade platform gives it a strong shot at standing out. Now, with Trump backing clearer digital asset regulation and even hinting at a national Bitcoin reserve, momentum is building. Institutions are starting to shift their strategy, and crypto-friendly U.S. policies are making the market more attractive. For Bullish, that means the stars may finally be aligning for a successful IPO. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bullish’s IPO filing signals a strong resurgence in crypto market confidence, driven by renewed investor interest and a more favorable U.S. political and regulatory climate, indicating a maturing industry. What advantages does Bullish’s institutional focus give it in going public? Bullish’s institutional focus, offering robust infrastructure, deep liquidity, and regulatory compliance (Gibraltar), makes it appealing to traditional investors seeking regulated crypto exposure, a key advantage for a successful IPO. How might U.S. political support influence Bullish’s IPO prospects? Strong U.S. political support, including a pro-crypto stance from the Trump administration and a “regulatory thaw” (e.g., SEC dropping cases), creates a more predictable and attractive environment for Bullish’s IPO, increasing investor confidence.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/peter-thiel-backed-bullish-eyes-ipo-in-confidential-sec-filing/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T12:09:15,"SUI TVL notches double-digit gains, eyes return to $2B as ETF whispers grow","The layer-1 blockchain Sui is gaining fresh momentum, edging closer to reclaiming its $2 billion total value locked (TVL) milestone as positive developments ripple through the ecosystem. According to DeFiLlama data on June 10, 2025, the total value locked on the Sui now sits at $1.96 billion. This marks an approximate 10% increase from the $1.77 range it maintained over the past week, bringing the protocol closer to regaining the $2 billion milestone achieved earlier this year. You might also like: Solana, Litecoin, and XRP top ETF approval odds as analysts weigh in SUI’s TVL growth comes as talks of a potential SUI exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch gain steam across the industry. As recently announced, Nasdaq has filed a 19b-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list the 21Shares SUI ETF. Nasdaq just filed to list the 21Shares SUI ETF — a spot ETF backed by the SUI token. From $300M+ in global ETP inflows to a potential U.S. listing, institutional momentum for Sui is very real. Next stop: institutional adoption. pic.twitter.com/5AGtmXimHs — Sui (@SuiNetwork) June 10, 2025 This filing follows 21Shares’ S-1 registration in April, formally initiating the regulatory review process for a spot ETF based on the SUI token. Market analysts have also placed odds for a SUI ETF approval in 2025 at 60%, fueling the positive sentiment. Kevin Boon, the president of Sui’s founding team Mysten Labs, praised the development stating, “Looking back at our mainnet only two years ago, the milestone of a NASDAQ filing is a powerful moment. We are proud to help 21Shares build towards a world where every investor can access SUI.” Beyond the ETF speculation, multiple ecosystem-wide developments are also contributing to Sui’s rising TVL. For one, the network has seen an increase in Bitcoin-pegged assets, with around 10% of its locked value now held in tokens such as wBTC, LBTC, and stBTC. Additionally, Sui recently crossed a major liquidity threshold, with over $1 billion in stablecoins now circulating across its DeFi applications. Meanwhile, the native token of the protocol SUI ( SUI ) has been on a modest climb all week. At press time, it trades around $3.47, reflecting a 2% gain over the past 24 hours and approximately 7% over the last week.

2025-06-11T12:07:44,"Connecticut bans state use and investment in crypto under sweeping new law","Connecticut has enacted a sweeping ban on state-level use, investment, or custody of virtual currencies, blocking any potential creation of a public Bitcoin reserve. On June 10, Connecticut has enacte d HB 7082, a sweeping overhaul of the state’s money transmission laws that includes a strict prohibition on the use of virtual currencies by state entities. The new law, signed as Public Act 25-66 and effective October 1, bars the state and its political subdivisions from accepting payments in virtual currency or from purchasing, holding, investing in, or establishing a reserve of such currencies. The statute defines “virtual currency” as provided in section 36a-596 of Connecticut’s general statutes, a definition broad enough to cover most cryptocurrencies in use today. The bill passed unanimously through both chambers of the state legislature, signaling broad bipartisan consensus against state-sponsored virtual currency initiatives, including any form of a sovereign bitcoin reserve. Source: @Bitcoin _Laws You might also like: Texas approves Bitcoin reserve bill, awaits governor’s signature In addition to the ban, HB 7082 imposes tighter regulations on private-sector money transmitters involved with virtual currencies. It requires businesses that deal in digital wallets or crypto kiosks to be licensed and to comply with strict financial safeguards, including 1:1 reserve backing for virtual currencies held on behalf of customers, detailed consumer risk disclosures, fraud protections, transaction limits, and receipt requirements. Connecticut’s move stands in stark contrast to the growing momentum in many other U.S. states, where legislatures are actively advancing bills to establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserves. According to the State Reserve Race tracker by Bitcoin Laws , Arizona and New Hampshire have fully enacted SBR bills into law, completing all legislative steps. Texas passed its bill through both chambers but have not yet finalized enactment, awaiting governor’s signature .

Many individuals in this period are looking for the one coin that will bring them a multiple return on their investment. Every week, there’s a new project, a new listing, or a fresh trend making noise across the space. After the quick dip experienced when Bitcoin fell to the $100,000 area, the market quickly recovered and now the market is buzzing again with new tokens getting attention, and communities forming around promising ideas.

It’s a protocol that lets users and apps interact smoothly across different VMs without the hassle of switching wallets or using complicated bridges. At the heart of this system is the SKATE token, which helps secure the network, lets holders vote on important decisions, and rewards people who help grow the ecosystem. The maximum supply is 1 billion SKATE tokens, with 150 million in circulation already. As per Coinmarketcap Skate Coin price at the time of writing is $0.054. Skate works through three main parts: the Hub Chain, Skate AVS which keeps everything secure using advanced technology, and the Executor Network which manages tasks between chains. This setup makes it possible for apps to run smoothly across many blockchains at once. What makes Skate really stand out is how it solves a big problem in crypto: fragmentation.

2025-06-11T04:32:43,"ETH Technical Analysis as ETH Futures Conquers $2800","<p>Ethereum (ETH) Futures: Comprehensive Analysis & Institutional Bullish Signals</p><p>The past weeks have seen Ethereum (ETH) futures steadily gaining momentum, marked by increasing trading volumes and institutional inflows. The evolving landscape of Ethereum ETFs further supports a bullish short-term narrative, driving increased optimism among crypto traders and investors. This article provides a detailed technical and fundamental overview of ETH futures, enriched by institutional data and a strategic technical analysis.</p><p>Technical Analysis Video Transcript:</p><p>I present the bigger picture of where ETH futures is at, and the next targets above the current price, that I am looking at, in this ETH futures technical analysis video.</p><p>We notice an important purple channel shown in the video. I expect Ether to cross upward again, creating another touchpoint on the red resistance and breaking out above.</p><p>From the volume profile analysis and other methodologies from tradeCompass at ForexLive.com and investingLive.com, the next key price targets I anticipate are $2,882, and possibly - $2,920, and $2,967. Reaching the second target (around 2,920) implies another approximate 4% move, offering an attractive opportunity for day traders and short-term swing traders.</p><p>However, we might see a scenario where Ether revisits either the upper boundary of the purple channel or even retests the red line around 2,825. These specific figures require referencing additional charts, but the current orientation shows bulls firmly maintaining control. Personally, I would not choose to short here, expecting a decline.</p><p>Sophisticated traders are likely to take profits into liquidity spikes, with a minimum upside target near $2,880.</p><p>Please trade ETH and other crypto assets at your own risk only. This is not financial advice. </p><p>Importantly, if we observe two consecutive bearish daily candles, each clearly closing below the aforementioned resistance, this would challenge the current bullish bias and could hand control back to bears. Lastly, beware of fake-outs on lower timeframes.</p><p>Institutional Support and ETF Inflows:</p><p>Recent institutional data strongly underpins Ethereum’s bullish outlook. Notably, on June 10, Ethereum Spot ETFs witnessed a significant net inflow of $125 million, prominently driven by major asset managers:</p><ul><li><p>Blackrock: $80.60M</p></li><li><p>Fidelity: $26.30M</p></li><li><p>Bitwise: $8.40M</p></li><li><p>Grayscale: $9.70M</p></li></ul><p>This robust institutional participation highlights strategic accumulation and bullish sentiment among major players, indicating that smart money continues to favor Ethereum.</p><p>Volume Shift ETH vs. BTC:</p><p>A critical volume shift further cements ETH’s bullish momentum. Ethereum's trading volume increased dramatically by approximately $29.60 billion within a 24-hour timeframe, contrasting starkly with Bitcoin’s volume drop of $28.31 billion. This divergence demonstrates a clear investor shift, possibly indicating a rotation away from Bitcoin toward Ethereum, potentially driven by fundamental developments or favorable sentiment towards ETH’s utility and upcoming network improvements.</p><p>ETH Futures Market Data:</p><ul><li><p>Current ETH Futures Price: $2,806.5</p></li><li><p>Daily Range: $2,785.0 - $2,845.5</p></li><li><p>52-week Range: $1,387.0 - $4,142.5</p></li><li><p>Volume & Open Interest:</p><ul><li><p>Volume: 1.63K contracts (moderate liquidity)</p></li><li><p>Open Interest: 15.47K contracts (significant institutional presence)</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Performance indicators remain strong:</p><ul><li><p>Weekly (1W): +6.95%</p></li><li><p>Monthly (1M): +10.66%</p></li><li><p>Quarterly (3M): +46.84%</p></li></ul><p>These indicators highlight a robust short-term recovery and bullish momentum in Ethereum futures.</p><p>ETH Futures Forward Curve Analysis:</p><p>The futures forward curve projects steadily increasing Ethereum prices into mid-2026, aligning with heightened institutional interest and bullish long-term outlook. This trajectory underscores market confidence in Ethereum’s ongoing developments and strategic positioning in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Conclusion and Key Takeaways for Ethereum traders:</p><ul><li><p>Ethereum futures exhibit significant bullish short-term momentum.</p></li><li><p>Institutional ETF inflows confirm robust investor confidence.</p></li><li><p>Dramatic positive volume shift highlights market rotation favoring Ethereum.</p></li><li><p>Critical technical resistance points at $2,882, $2,920, and $2,967 should guide short-term trading strategies.</p></li></ul><p>Risk Disclaimer:
