2025-06-11T10:57:43,"Ukraine Proposes Law to Hold Bitcoin in National Reserves","The post Ukraine Proposes Law to Hold Bitcoin in National Reserves appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ukraine is taking a bold step toward financial innovation. A new draft bill has been introduced in the Ukrainian Parliament that could allow the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in its national reserves. Ukrainian Lawmakers Push Pro-Crypto Legislation On June 10, 2025 , Ukrainian lawmakers submitted a draft law titled: “Draft Law on Amendments to the Law of Ukraine On the National Bank of Ukraine regarding the inclusion of virtual assets in the gold and foreign exchange reserves of Ukraine. This bill was proposed by several members of the Verkhovna Rada, including Yaroslav Zhelezniak , Oleksiy Zhmerenetskyi , Maksym Buzhanskyi , and others. Zhelezniak confirmed the development through his official Telegram channel, calling it a step forward in modernizing Ukraine’s financial infrastructure. What Does the Ukraine Crypto Bill Propose? The proposed legislation does not mandate the NBU to buy or hold crypto assets. Instead, it gives the central bank the legal option to include digital assets like Bitcoin in its gold and foreign exchange reserves. “How, when, and how much should be the decision of the regulator itself,” Zhelezniak clarified. Why This Move Matters for Ukraine With the ongoing war against Russia, Ukraine’s economy faces severe stress—GDP contraction, infrastructure damage, and dependence on foreign aid. The move to legalize crypto reserves could: Support macroeconomic stability Attract foreign investment Encourage digital innovation Help integrate Ukraine into the global economy Strategic Crypto Reserves: A Global Trend? Ukraine is not alone. Countries worldwide are exploring crypto reserves: In March 2025 , the United States launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021. Switzerland and Hong Kong have introduced crypto-friendly policies. Brazil is reportedly considering its own Bitcoin reserve. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ukraine Proposes Law to Hold Bitcoin in National Reserves , Why Countries in Crisis Turn to Crypto For countries facing economic instability or conflict , crypto offers: Access to global markets Bypass traditional banking restrictions Hedge against inflation and currency collapse Empower digital economic growth Ukraine follows the path of others like: Pakistan , which created a Crypto Council in March 2025 and later allocated energy for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers . El Salvador , where economic instability led to historic adoption of Bitcoin. Final Thoughts If passed, Ukraine’s crypto bill could be a turning point—marking the country’s deeper alignment with global financial innovation . Allowing the central bank to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset could not only strengthen the economy but also position Ukraine as a crypto-forward nation in the post-war recovery phase. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-11T10:51:16,"XRP Created Thousands of Millionaires: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Same Opportunity with 233% Guaranteed Launch Returns","The post XRP Created Thousands of Millionaires: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Same Opportunity with 233% Guaranteed Launch Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2017, XRP shocked the crypto world by turning average investors into millionaires seemingly overnight. For those who missed that golden run, another opportunity may already be unfolding—one with even more upside, and this time, it’s built on stronger tech and real accessibility. Meet Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a new asset surging in both hype and substance—and currently sitting at just $7 in its presale phase. XRP Was Just the Beginning XRP’s explosive rise to $2.19 and beyond created more than just financial gains—it birthed a generation of early believers who cashed in when the world least expected it. While XRP still plays a role in the altcoin space, its growth curve has matured. Meanwhile, new contenders are stepping up—especially ones like Bitcoin Solaris that offer next-gen infrastructure, unmatched scalability, and a launch strategy engineered for wealth generation. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just promising a moonshot. It’s building the launchpad. Why Bitcoin Solaris Feels Like a Once-in-a-Decade Opportunity At its core, Bitcoin Solaris offers a technological evolution rooted in a dual-consensus hybrid model—a base layer secured by Proof of Work (PoW) for resilience, and an upper Solaris Layer powered by high-speed Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). The result? A robust blockchain that delivers over 10,000 TPS, while consuming 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin. But tech alone isn’t why BTC-S is capturing headlines. Its appeal is built around mobile-first accessibility, intuitive mining, and most importantly—an economic model designed to make its users rich. Built-in validator rotation system ensures fairness and decentralization. Smart contracts are fully audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins to meet enterprise-grade standards. Its low entry cost during presale is already drawing comparisons to early Bitcoin and Solana phases. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Mining Reimagined for Normal People What if mining wasn’t reserved for big rigs and massive energy bills? Bitcoin Solaris is breaking the mold through its upcoming Solaris Nova App , which allows users to mine from smartphones, desktops, and even browsers. Backed by adaptive algorithms, built-in security, and gamification features, it’s not just mining—it’s a movement. Whether you’re a casual user or hardcore enthusiast, BTC-S makes mining simple, secure, and profitable without needing a warehouse of hardware. 233% Launch Returns? Why This Presale Is Turning Heads With less than 8 weeks remaining in its presale window, Bitcoin Solaris is gaining unprecedented momentum. Over 11,000 users have already jumped in, pushing the raise over $4.1 million with no signs of slowing down. At the current $7 price, investors are positioning themselves ahead of a $20 launch, locking in a 233% return before the public even gets access. BTC-S isn’t just another presale—it’s one of the shortest and most explosive we’ve seen this cycle. Bitcoin Solaris is also becoming a staple in YouTube crypto circles. A detailed review by 2Bit Crypto outlines why so many investors believe this project is uniquely positioned for breakout success. How Bitcoin Solaris Could Make You Rich When people talk about wealth creation in crypto, it often centers around timing. But BTC-S is making a new argument: it’s not just about when you invest—it’s about what you invest in. Bitcoin Solaris is built for real-world scaling: Instant finality in under 2 seconds Cross-chain bridges enabling DeFi expansion Decentralized governance built into the core protocol Mobile-first strategy enabling millions to mine Add a low entry point and massive upside potential—and BTC-S starts looking like the smartest $1,000 you could deploy in 2025. Roadmap That Supports Long-Term Value BTC-S isn’t a pump-and-dump. It’s backed by a clearly structured roadmap that spans eight phases, including: Q3 2026: Full launch of the mainnet and Solaris Nova app Q4 2026: Mining Power Marketplace goes live 2027: Layer-2 scaling, DEX launch, and Fortune 500 partnerships 2028+: AI integrations and blockchain education initiatives Each milestone positions BTC-S to expand its ecosystem and multiply its real-world use cases. Final Verdict If you missed XRP’s moonshot, you now have a second chance—one with more transparency, better tech, and a presale price that feels like a throwback to 2011. Bitcoin Solaris has the infrastructure, team, and momentum to deliver not just 2X or 5X—but real 20X potential. All you need is to act before this window closes.

2025-06-11T10:39:01,"Trump Sons Hoard Bitcoin, Top Altcoins to Surge from Token Acquisitions","You don’t get to be one of the richest and most powerful men in the world by giving up good opportunities. That’s a lesson Trump seems to have taught his sons well – they’re currently out buying Bitcoin, and have amassed a stockpile of $23.7M in $BTC. But is that the smartest play in crypto right now? Even Strategy’s much-vaunted plan to add to its ever-growing 528K Bitcoin stockpile is risky, with experts warning that it might actually decrease demand for Bitcoin from central banks . While the Trumps are buying BTC, you should snap up these altcoins for some major gains flying under the Bitcoin radar. Yet Another Trump/Bitcoin Headline When Donald Trump said he’d be the first Crypto President, no one knew what he meant. Now, it seems like the US president and his family are rapidly becoming an integral part of the crypto ecosystem, from the $TRUMP meme coin to the ill-fated Trump crypto wallet launch . Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump are both spearheading a new Bitcoin treasury corporation. The simply-named American Bitcoin is a crypto mining company planning to gather as much Bitcoin as possible. In the words of its SEC filing: ABTC considers its Bitcoin holdings to be long-term in nature and expects to continue accumulating Bitcoin. ABTC has not set any specific target for the amount of Bitcoin it seeks to hold… Bitcoin accumulation is not a side effect of ABTC’s business. It is the business. — American Bitcoin SEC filing , American Bitcoin The company’s off to a small start, with only 215 bought $BTC so far, but intends to add to that portfolio aggressively. And whether intentional or not, ABTC is actually proving a larger narrative, one that Swiss crypto bank Sygnum says is crucial for the continued health of the crypto economy. Could Big Bitcoin Treasuries Be Bad? Sygnum discussed the impact of large-scale Bitcoin treasuries like Strategy and highlightedt hat Strategy currently owns roughly 3% of all the Bitcoin that will ever be made. The company also said that ‘large, concentrated holdings are a risk for any asset,’ with Strategy’s stockpile ‘approaching a point where they become problematic.’ Why? Partly because of normal market economics and sentiment. Decreased liquid supply, caused by companies holding $BTC in large treasuries, can increase volatility. There’s also the psychological impact on the market; if Strategy should ever sell any of their $BTC, the headline ‘Strategy Sells Bitcoin’ might be enough to send the price plummeting. Just as the opposite headline is causing bull rushes in the market nowadays And for both those reasons, large-scale treasuries like Strategy’s might demotivate central banks to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. So what’s an honest investor to do? In this case, don’t follow the Trumps. Instead, take a look at these best altcoins to buy in a market that’s still indecisive about Bitcoin’s impact. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Layer-2 Has Arrived Solaxy ($SOLX) solves Solana’s lingering problems. Yes, Solana is fast, and yes, it’s cheap (when compared to Ethereum’s notorious gas fees). But it’s also prone to congestion and the occasional failed transaction, and simply can’t keep up with Ethereum’s scalability. Enter Solaxy, the first-ever Solana Layer-2 solution. It brings faster transaction speeds, zero execution failures, and a multichain architecture and token. $SOLX will launch on Ethereum and be bridgeable to Solaxy when the Layer-2 fully deploys. Solaxy forms the next evolution of the always-expanding Solana ecosystem. It will combine Ethereum’s strength and reliability with Solana’s speed, providing an unparalleled advantage for new crypto projects and meme coin launches. With only 5 days left in the ongoing presale, check out our price prediction to see why we think the $SOLX price could rise from its current $0.001752 to $0.032 by the end of 2025, increasing by 1,700%. Learn how to buy $SOLX , and don’t miss out on a presale that has already raised $47M. Visit the Solaxy presale page . 2. XRP ($XRP) – Ripple’s Leading Altcoin Expands to EVM XRP has notched a number of wins recently, including: Launch of an EVM sidechain Rumors of potential XRP integration with European Central Bank (ECB) Partnership with Guggenheim to launch digital commercial paper It all helps to explain why the number of transactions on XRP experienced a recent spike. $XRP is up 14% year-to-date, with possibilities of a spot ETF lingering on the horizon, a move that boosted demand for $BTC and $ETH last year. XRP is one of the original mainstays of the crypto ecosystem, launched way back in 2012. It’s become a frequently-used tool for cross-border payments. Check out XRP’s whitepaper and technical details to learn more about the world’s fourth-largest crypto. 3. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Sniff Out Top Solana Meme Coins, Profit with Snorter Bot The best meme coins often start small – even underground, on platforms Telegram. Opportunities abound, but so do risks like honeypots (scam tokens that can’t be sold) and rug pulls (malicious tokens). Trading is fast-paced, and opportunities come and go quickly. Enter the Snorter Bot and the Snorter Token ($SNORT) . Honeypot and rugpull detection avoid dangers, while the bot can execute fast, secure swaps and automatic sniping thanks to the $SNORT token. Traders can even set limit orders and copy other successful traders with the bot. It’s an entire arsenal of advanced trading tools in a tool that has a distinct meme coin flair. During the presale, $SNORT can be staked for 468% dynamic APY, providing long-term yield over the next year. With its presale raising over $686K and the token price set at $0.0949, the project is looking very promising. As if it could snort every bit of profit for you. Read more on how to buy Snorter Token , and visit the Snorter Token presale page to get them while they’re hot and cheap. Smart Investors Find Opportunities in Bitcoin Alternatives While the Trumps double down on Bitcoin, savvy investors may want to look elsewhere while the debates are firing back and forth. With Solaxy solving Solana’s scalability, XRP expanding to the EVM, and Snorter Token offering real utility in meme coin trading, these altcoins could offer great upside and less systemic risk. Certainly less so than blindly following the lesser scions of the Trump empire. As always, do your own research.

2025-06-11T10:37:29,"HYPE Surges 250% & SOL Eyes $152 Breakout: BlockDAG’s $0.0018 Entry with 25% Referral Rewards Outpaces Both","What happens when one coin hits $35, another eyes $152, and a third starts compounding gains before even launching? The crypto market is delivering answers in real time. Solana’s price recovery is building steam after bouncing from $141.19 support, with analysts watching for a breakout above $152 to confirm that V-shaped reversal. Hyperliquid continues holding above $35 despite its 250% yearly surge, while on-chain data shows buying pressure still outweighs selling. Taking a different approach entirely is BlockDAG (BDAG) . With BDAG priced under $0.002 and a 25% referral system letting early buyers stack coins instantly, this could be that rare pre-launch opportunity. The June 13 GO LIVE reveal is approaching fast. Solana: When Momentum Coins Show Real Strength Solana’s price recovery isn’t happening in isolation. Hyperliquid (HYPE) just delivered a stunning 250% rally, rocketing from $10 to $37 and now trading above $35. While technical indicators like MACD and RSI suggest some near-term cooling might be ahead, the overall bullish framework remains intact. What’s particularly interesting is how on-chain data tells a different story than the overbought RSI readings above 90. Buy orders are still outpacing sells, indicating that demand hasn’t dried up despite the massive run. Both HYPE and Solana demonstrate how momentum-driven assets can maintain their upward trajectory when key support levels hold and community sentiment stays strong. HYPE’s Critical Test: Will $35 Support Hold After Monster Rally? Hyperliquid’s 250% surge from $10 has traders laser-focused on the $35 level. This price point has become the make-or-break zone that could determine whether HYPE pushes back toward $37 or faces a sharper correction. Technical indicators are flashing mixed signals, with overbought conditions battling against persistent buying pressure. The real story lies in the price action structure. HYPE continues printing higher highs and higher lows across multiple timeframes, suggesting the bullish trend hasn’t been broken. If profit-taking accelerates and pushes the price below $34, things could get interesting fast. However, the consistent buying interest on every pullback suggests this momentum play might have more room to run. BlockDAG’s 25% Referral Bonus: The Early Bitcoin Opportunity You Can’t Ignore BlockDAG’s current 25% referral program is transforming casual crypto conversations into serious coin accumulation. When someone you refer purchases $400 worth of BDAG tokens, you instantly receive $100 worth of coins in your balance. There’s no waiting period, no complex unlock schedules, just immediate rewards that hit your account automatically. With BDAG currently priced at just $0.0018 until June 13, this represents one of the final low entry opportunities before exchange listings begin. The presale has already generated approximately $294.3 million in funding, with over 22.1 billion BDAG tokens distributed to early participants. Current holders are looking at projected returns of 2,520% compared to Batch 1 pricing, and with a rumored listing price target of $0.05, those gains could multiply significantly. This is why BlockDAG is earning recognition as the next explosive crypto opportunity, with fundamentals aligning before public trading even begins. The platform’s appeal extends beyond price speculation. The X1 Miner app boasts 1.5 million active users who earn daily BDAG rewards through their smartphones without gas fees. Combined with CertiK security auditing and high-profile partnerships including Inter Milan and a rumored NBA collaboration, BlockDAG has built institutional-grade credibility that most early-stage projects never achieve. The Future of Crypto Hyperliquid continues defying gravity above $35 despite its massive 250% run, with on-chain data showing buyers remain engaged even as technical indicators suggest cooling ahead. Solana’s recovery momentum is building toward a crucial test at $152, where bulls hope to lock in that V-shaped reversal pattern from the $141 low. For those hunting the next explosive opportunity, BlockDAG’s presale window closes June 13 with BDAG still priced at $0.0018. The 25% referral system is letting early participants stack coins while $294.3 million in funding validates serious interest. With the GO LIVE reveal approaching, this could be that rare second chance to catch lightning before the broader market catches on.

The decentralized exchange token surged over 20% in 24 hours to $8.61 on June 11 — an 84% rise from its April low. UNI market capitalization has now exceeded $5 billion, more than Aave’s. Volume also surged over 150% to $1.39 billion in one day. Technical Indicators Affirm Bullish Momentum The breakout is further cemented by several bullish indications. UNI not only busted the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline but also formed a golden cross earlier this week as the 20-day moving average penetrated above the 50-day. Momentum indicators also affirm the bullish setup: MACD and RSI trending upward Price broke a long-term downtrend of lower highs and lows Long/short ratio remains greater than 1, showing most traders expect further appreciation Open interest on UNI derivatives spiked 54% to $713 million — all-time high If the trend holds, UNI can rally another 37% to around $10.40, which matches the 24.7% Fibonacci retracement level. Uniswap Smart Wallet and Regulatory News Drive Rally Bullish sentiment is also being driven by June 10’s roll-out of Uniswap Labs’ Smart Wallet, which is intended to simplify onchain interactions with amenities like: Gas abstraction Automated token approvals Regulatory optimism has also increased at the same time. On June 9, SEC Chair Paul Atkins stated the agency has a proposed “innovation exemption” in development to facilitate easier entry for DeFi projects. The statement fueled chatter of a potential “DeFi Summer 2.0.” On-Chain Activity and Bitcoin Correlation Uniswap’s network activity reflects this renewed interest. Daily active addresses rose 92% in 24 hours, pointing to rising engagement. UNI’s rally is also tracking Bitcoin’s broader bullish movement, as BTC climbed above $110,000, driven by optimism around U.S.–China trade progress. Key Levels to Watch Despite robust uptrend momentum, buyers are seeking significant support at $8.20, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. This region is often the first defense zone in uptrends. Dropping below $8.20 could lead to short-term consolidation. A break below $7.50 would invalidate the bullish breakout, and UNI could return to $4.70 support. Conclusion Uniswap’s breakout, surge volume, and favorable macro environment suggest a longer-term uptrend to $10.40 — provided key support levels hold.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/uniswap-breaks-out-of-inverse-head-and-shoulders/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|UNI","Blockchain|Sticky",cryptocompare

One of the wallets has been linked to risky trader James Wynn. Whales are floating back to Hyperliquid, opening new long positions. In the past 24 hours, several wallets longed Bitcoin (BTC) as the leading coin showed signs of momentum and the potential to rally to a new all-time high. BTC rallied on Wednesday, easily trading above $109,500. The crypto fear and greed index points to renewed increasing greed. However, most traders are hovering on the threshold between short and long positions. The Hyperliquid whales are showing signs of conviction, with up to 20X to 40X leverage in some cases. The most significant new whale deposited $29.85M in USDC over the past couple of days, with another $10M added in the past few hours. The whale is currently holding a single position with 20X leverage and a liquidation price of $103,710. It seems that James Wynn created a new wallet 6 days ago and continued his bets—going 40x long on $BTC and 10x long on $PEPE . The current unrealized profit exceeds $2M. https://t.co/MFz2JnYH46 https://t.co/lvMfS5nxQG pic.twitter.com/7h0DSadoX6 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 11, 2025 This whale’s position remains anonymous, though it has gained the attention of James Wynn. He has not claimed ownership, but he has given the whale exposure, potentially opening the long position for counter-trading. Wynn’s followers also suggest that he may actually be the whale, despite claiming he lost all his reserves in the previous liquidations. Wynn himself has previously called for other whales to take a similar risk, attempting to make large gains in a single trade going long on BTC. For now, the market has not shown any deliberate efforts to liquidate the position. Two smaller whales closed their BTC positions, then went on to long HYPE, the native token of Hyperliquid. Their liquidation prices for HYPE are as low as $19 and $10.73. Both the BTC and HYPE long whales bet on the same trend of exuberance, as Hyperliquid once again gained attention as the fastest way to tap crypto trends. James Wynn is back with a new wallet James Wynn, the risky trader who was liquidated several times, is most probably back with a new wallet. Previously, Wynn mentioned he would be back on Hyperliquid, though trying to protect his position from liquidation. Hyperliquid traders have logged smaller profits and losses in the past months, though whales still make outsized bets. | Source: Hyperliquid Wynn’s new wallet has a BTC position valued at more than $35M, with a liquidation price of $104,270. For now, the position has not been deliberately attacked, and has an unrealized profit of $1.3M. Wynn has been determined to hold the positions where possible and make even more outsized gains. Previously, he round-tripped a position with up to $100M in unrealized gains. This time around, other whales have surpassed Wynn with their larger positions, but there are few signs of deliberate counter-trading. In total, BTC open interest on Hyperliquid increased to $2.3B, though still below its peak of $4.48B. ETH and SOL open interests are also rising, with an uptick in general meme token and altcoin bets. One of the newly opened ETH positions is going short with 25X leverage, betting on a downward price move. Over time, Hyperliquid is also becoming less volatile, with fewer days of outsized gains, as well as a smaller amount of dramatic liquidations.

Here’s why","XRP has once again become the subject of debate in the cryptocurrency space after blockchain advocate John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) offered a high-profile comparison among XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, the three largest assets in the crypto market. In a recent post, Squire suggested that XRP addresses several of the limitations found in older blockchain systems, specifically those related to speed and efficiency. In his words, “Bitcoin is a landline, Ethereum is a cell phone, XRP is Starlink with no lag.” XRP has often been compared to Tesla and other ventures by Elon Musk, and Squire’s post quickly gained traction on X, with many commenters supporting his view that XRP offers more practical value in areas requiring fast and reliable transaction processing. Bitcoin is a landline, Ethereum is a cell phone, $XRP is Starlink with no lag. — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 8, 2025 Challenging Limitations of Legacy Assets Bitcoin remains constrained by slow block times and a proof-of-work system that is often criticized for its inefficiency. Bitcoin processes new blocks approximately every ten minutes, and a popular crypto YouTuber recently showed a five-hour BTC transaction to highlight the cryptocurrency’s problems. Ethereum, while offering greater functionality through smart contracts, also struggles with high network fees and variable performance under heavy use. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In contrast, XRP is designed to support fast and inexpensive transfers, with an average settlement time of just a few seconds. Transaction costs are typically less than a cent, making it one of the more cost-effective networks available. These attributes have made the asset a popular option among institutions that prioritize transaction speed and operational costs, such as banks and payment service providers. Many experts believe Bitcoin and Ethereum cannot compete with XRP in the global payment space. XRP Army Weighs In Panos Mekras recently questioned why anyone would hold BTC or ETH when XRP is fundamentally better. He described the asset as more sustainable and secure, and the “OG DeFi chain with everything built-in and no smart contract risks.” One commenter noted that Squire’s comparison reflects blockchain’s evolution, stating that Bitcoin laid the foundation, Ethereum added flexibility, and XRP is the next generation with a global reach and real-world utility . Red Cocktail, another commenter, said each currency defines an era, with XRP leading today. He also predicted a massive explosion once the global system shifts to the ISO 20022 standard . Another commenter likened the shift to software cycles, viewing XRP as the most advanced and scalable. While XRP has its skeptics, many supporters believe it is the best asset to lead the market. Although Bitcoin continues to be viewed by many as a long-term store of value, and Ethereum remains central to the dApp development, XRP is best suited for use cases that demand speed and scalability.

2025-06-11T10:22:10,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analysts Say It Can Touch $110 in Upcoming Days — Nexchain Leads Presale ICO List With $4.1M Raised","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analysts Say It Can Touch $110 in Upcoming Days — Nexchain Leads Presale ICO List With $4.1M Raised Analysts now expect Bitcoin to hit $110,000 in the next days. With the currency hovering around $107,000, day traders and short sellers being squeezed may add momentum to the surge. In this optimistic atmosphere, interest in pre-sale cryptocurrency options like as Nexchain is increasing. Nexchain has risen to the top of the cryptocurrency presale list, generating more than $4.1 million during its current ICO. Many believe it to be the best crypto presale to buy right now, and it is gaining interest from both experienced investors and beginners looking for fresh crypto token presale opportunities. Whether you’re looking to explore cryptocurrencies on presale or purchase presale crypto, Nexchain provides a unique combination of speed, size, and innovation in the token presale scene. Bitcoin Breakout Prediction: Can It Hit $110,000? According to crypto researcher Van de Poppe, Bitcoin is currently worth slightly over $106,500. He argues that rallies frequently occur when two important variables come together: strong purchasing and short sellers closing bets. As soon as a big price barrier is broken, opportunistic traders rush in, sending prices skyrocketing. He selected $108,900 as the turning point. In previous cycles, getting over that level has resulted in fast movement, fueled by traders closing short positions and fresh buyers joining. Bitcoin has been trading in a tight range for some weeks, so breaching over $106,500 indicates that buyers have regained control. If the current trend continues, a leap above $110,000 is quite plausible, reigniting interest in crypto presale projects that stand to gain from a larger market boom. Nexchain: The AI-Powered Blockchain for Speed and Sustainability Nexchain is a breakthrough pre-sale cryptocurrency based on an AI-powered blockchain. Its presale cryptocurrency tokens are offered at early-stage pricing, which rises with each step. The platform enables next-generation smart contracts and cross-chain interoperability.

The AI layer enables ultra-fast processing—up to 400,000 transactions per second—while preventing network congestion. Transactions are only $0.001, making Nexchain one of the most accessible blockchains in the presale cryptocurrency sector. Its low running costs are complemented by an energy-efficient design, making it a unique green chain on the market. Governance is completely decentralized, with all decisions made by token holders. Community members benefit from the blockchain’s success through a fair allocation of gas fees. Nexchain Pre-Sale Milestone and Audit Nexchain passed a CertiK smart contract audit , getting a 78 out of 100. The project is presently at Stage 17, and NEX tokens are valued at $0.066. The presale has raised $4,142,747 in USDT, indicating strong investor interest. Nexchain’s strong financial and technological base propels it to the top of the crypto ICO presale rankings. It provides both legitimacy and reward in the token presale environment. Final Thoughts: The Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now As Bitcoin approaches $110,000, savvy investors are seeking value-added opportunities in cryptocurrency presale initiatives. Nexchain meets the criteria with AI speed, minimal fees, environmentally sustainable design, and community-led governance. It has risen to the top of the best crypto presales list owing to robust investment and a dependable audit. Nexchain is now at Stage 17 and is priced at $0.066, making it one of the finest crypto presales to buy in right now.

2025-06-11T10:15:54,"Why Qubetics Is the Top Crypto to Join for 2025 as Solana and Kaspa Redefine Blockchain’s Future","The Blockchain Group is raising over $340 million to grow its Bitcoin treasury, following a recent $68 million BTC purchase. Inspired by U.S.-style “At the Market” offerings, the move signals rising institutional adoption in Europe. It comes as Bitcoin consolidates after hitting an all-time high of $112,000, with similar treasury-driven strategies seen from firms like Strategy, which now plans a $1 billion raise to expand its BTC holdings. Amid rising global economic uncertainty and a surge in digital asset adoption, many are asking which cryptocurrencies stand out as the top cryptos to join for 2025. Qubetics has recently captured significant attention for its innovative approach to solving blockchain scalability and usability issues. Its growing ecosystem promises to meet the demands of businesses and users seeking efficient, secure digital solutions. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market continues to experience regulatory shifts and technological breakthroughs, influencing the performance of established and emerging projects alike. The interplay between market volatility and rapid technological development creates a dynamic environment where only the most adaptable protocols remain relevant. Qubetics , Solana, and Kaspa each bring unique value propositions that align with the future needs of decentralized finance and blockchain applications. Qubetics, in particular, aims to address the shortcomings of previous projects through its advanced development tools and community governance model. This makes these coins essential contenders among the top cryptos to join for 2025, appealing to both technology enthusiasts and digital finance strategists. Qubetics Unlocking Blockchain Potential: The QubeQode and Qubetics IDE Qubetics is distinguished not only by its tokenomics but also by the robust tools powering its ecosystem: QubeQode and the Qubetics Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These innovations serve as critical enablers for businesses, professionals, and developers seeking to adopt blockchain technology with minimal friction. QubeQode offers a streamlined platform to connect smart contracts, decentralized applications, and other blockchain utilities into a cohesive framework. This facilitates operational efficiency and reduces the technical complexity traditionally associated with blockchain deployment. The Qubetics IDE is designed as an all-in-one development suite that supports the creation, testing, and deployment of smart contracts. It is tailored to be user-friendly for those without extensive programming knowledge while retaining advanced features for experienced developers. This combination significantly lowers entry barriers for blockchain adoption in real-world applications. Key Features of QubeQode and Qubetics IDE: Simplified smart contract creation and management Integrated testing environment with real-time debugging Support for multiple programming languages commonly used in blockchain development Enhanced security features aligned with industry best practices Tools designed to accelerate enterprise and individual adoption By providing these tools, Qubetics addresses the limitations of earlier blockchain projects that failed to offer accessible development platforms, positioning itself at the forefront of the top cryptos to join for 2025. Qubetics: Final Crypto Presale Phase Marks a Defining Moment in Blockchain Evolution Qubetics ($TICS) is currently in its 37th crypto presale stage, having sold over 515 million tokens to a growing community exceeding 27,800 holders. The project has successfully raised more than $17.9 million in this ongoing crypto presale phase. At this stage, tokens are priced at $0.3370, with only 10 million $TICS tokens remaining at this fixed price before a 20% price increase occurs upon listing. This shrinking supply is the product of a recent tokenomics overhaul that reduced total supply from over 4 billion tokens to just 1.36 billion, deliberately creating scarcity to enhance long-term value. This strategic realignment amplifies the public sale allocation to 38.55%, shifting token control into the hands of the community and reinforcing Qubetics’ vision of a decentralized, user-governed ecosystem. The project’s governance model emphasizes community-led decision-making and rewards, reflecting a commitment to democratizing blockchain utility and fostering user engagement. Qubetics’ emphasis on scarcity and community control has already attracted analyst predictions projecting substantial post-listing price momentum. Early market analysis highlights limited token supply, robust demand, and a community-first design as key drivers behind this forecast. The current phase of the crypto presale thus represents a critical opportunity for those looking to participate in one of the top cryptos to join for 2025. Qubetics recently announced integration partnerships that extend the capabilities of its QubeQode platform, enabling seamless enterprise adoption. The team also revealed milestones in the Qubetics IDE development, designed to lower barriers for smart contract creation, testing, and deployment. These tools are crafted to support businesses and professionals in harnessing blockchain technology without requiring deep technical expertise, setting Qubetics apart in the crowded crypto market. Charting Your Course with Qubetics: The $5,000 Strategic Play For early investors, the financial appeal of Qubetics is quite strong. A $5,000 at the current price of $0.3370 would secure roughly 14,837 $TICS tokens. When the token officially launches at $0.40, that initial investment would immediately be worth $5,935, netting you a quick $935 profit. But the real excitement comes with the long-term forecasts. If $TICS reaches $5 per token, the $5,000 could swell to $74,185. And if it hits the projected $10 mark, that same investment would yield a remarkable $148,370, representing an astonishing 2,867% return. This presale is a unique chance, offering both immediate gains upon listing and significant potential for long-term growth, making it very appealing to those looking for both quick wins and substantial future returns. Solana (SOL) Surges Over 5% in 24 Hours as Volume Jumps Nearly 74% Solana (SOL), ranked #6 by market cap, is making headlines with a strong 5.21% daily gain, bringing its price to $158.46 and pushing its market cap to $83.18 billion. Trading volume spiked 73.83% over the past 24 hours to $3.89 billion, indicating renewed participant interest and momentum. With a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $95.5 billion and a circulating supply of 524.92 million SOL out of a total 602.7 million, the project shows strong on-chain activity, reflected in its 4.67% volume-to-market cap ratio. Despite being down 46.11% from its all-time high of $294.33 reached on January 19, 2025, Solana remains up a staggering 31,297.07% from its all-time low in May 2020. Its profile score stands at 66%, with a community rating of 4.1 and support from explorers like Solscan and various crypto wallets. Kaspa (KAS) Jumps Over 6% in 24 Hours as Trading Volume Nears $57M Kaspa (KAS), currently ranked #39 by market cap, surged 6.61% in the past 24 hours to $0.08983, pushing its market capitalization to $2.36 billion—a 6.98% increase. Trading volume also saw a healthy 31.91% uptick, reaching $56.61 million, with a volume-to-market cap ratio of 2.39%. With a total and circulating supply of 26.29 billion KAS and a max supply capped at 28.7 billion, the project boasts a robust 92% profile score. Although Kaspa remains 56.64% below its all-time high of $0.2075 set in August 2024, it has delivered an extraordinary 52,867.86% gain from its all-time low of $0.0001699 in June 2022. Supported by wallets and blockchain explorers like explorer.kaspa.org, KAS continues to attract attention as a high-performance proof-of-work blockchain with increasing community traction. Final Thoughts The current crypto market is characterized by rapid technological progress and a shift towards more user-centric governance and utility. Qubetics, Solana, and Kaspa each demonstrate unique strengths, from Qubetics’ crypto presale momentum and innovative development platforms to Solana’s scalable dApps ecosystem and Kaspa’s cross-border payment solutions. Particularly, Qubetics’ crypto presale in its final public phase presents a narrowing window for participation, with just 10 million $TICS tokens remaining at the current fixed price of $0.3370 before an imminent 20% increase. The intentional scarcity introduced by Qubetics’ tokenomics overhaul, combined with community-driven governance and cutting-edge developer tools, provides a compelling case for considering this protocol among the top cryptos to join for 2025 . The growing nature of blockchain demands adaptable, scalable solutions, and Qubetics appears well-positioned to meet these requirements. Engaging with these projects offers insight into the future trajectory of digital finance and the transformative potential of blockchain technology. Exploring Qubetics’ crypto presale and ecosystem advancements now ensures readiness to participate in the next chapter of blockchain evolution.

Regulation Eases, Innovation Takes Off Hougan believes the crypto industry is finally breaking free from the restrictions of the past few years. “Applications and real-world use cases were artificially suppressed by the hostile regulatory environment of 2020-2024,” he said. “But the infrastructure kept improving, and is now remarkably robust.” Now that those barriers are falling away, technologies like stablecoins, DeFi, tokenization, and DePin are ready to grow fast. Hougan describes the moment as a “coiled spring”, suggesting that a big surge in adoption could be just around the corner. Bitcoin Hits $110K – Could $150K Be Next? The numbers back him up. Bitcoin’s $110,000 landmark was unthinkable last cycle, and a recovery could push it to $150,000 or beyond. That kind of growth would mark a shift away from the short-lived rallies of the past and show that the market is maturing. Trump’s Return Gives Crypto a Boost The political climate in the U.S. is changing fast. Since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, crypto has seen a sharp turn in its favor. The SEC has dropped multiple cases against crypto companies, and the White House just hosted its first crypto convention. With the government showing more support, institutional investors are stepping in. That’s a big difference from previous cycles, which were largely driven by retail traders. Hougan says this broader backing could help extend the bull run. “This cycle won’t fade away as it did previously,” he noted. Hougan is confident about what’s next. In a recent interview, he predicted a “fantastic” second half of the year for crypto. With institutional demand on the rise and fewer regulatory hurdles, crypto is finding its place in mainstream finance. Time to Rethink the Crypto Playbook Hougan’s long-term outlook isn’t new. Back in January, he said a crypto winter in 2026 was unlikely. And with Bitcoin’s next halving not expected until 2028, the timeline for the current cycle could stretch far beyond what we’re used to. For investors, that means adjusting to a new kind of market, one that includes big institutions, stronger government support, and a growing list of real-world use cases. The next downturn may still come, but this time, the industry may be more prepared than ever to bounce back.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/extended-crypto-cycle-ahead-says-bitwise-cio-as-bitcoin-hits-110k/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-11T10:10:08,"Connecticut law prohibits the state from investing in Bitcoin (BTC)","Connecticut passed HB-7082, which prohibits the state from accepting, holding, or investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The bill passed the House and Senate unanimously and introduced new requirements for crypto-related remittance agencies to verify parental consent for users under 18 years. The bill, officially titled “An Act Concerning the Regulation of Virtual Currency and State Investments,” imposed a comprehensive ban on the state and local governments from investing in crypto assets. Separate from money transmission, the bill prohibited Connecticut and its political subdivisions from accepting or requiring payment in the form of virtual currency or purchasing, holding, investing in, or establishing a digital currency reserve. It also stipulated that crypto businesses must adhere to strict anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. The bill also regulates minors’ access to certain money-sharing applications by imposing restrictions and duties on those businesses. It generally prohibits any business, beginning on October 1, 2025, from allowing anyone to sponsor, open, or establish a money-sharing application account for a minor unless the business receives an attestation from the person stating that he or she is the minor’s parent. HB7082 imposes two restrictions on crypto custody and control The new law imposed two restrictions on the handling of crypto by businesses that engaged in the transmission of money within Connecticut by receiving, sending, storing, or maintaining custody or control of virtual currency. First, it prohibited the businesses from selling, transferring, assigning, lending, hypothecating, pledging, or otherwise using or encumbering virtual currency stored, held, controlled, maintained by, or under the custody or control of the business on a person’s behalf—except for the sale, transfer of ownership, or assignment at the person’s direction. Second, it limited the current law’s provisions authorizing these crypto-related businesses to use designated agents to provide money transmission services on their behalf. However, regardless of those current authorizations, the bill also prohibited the businesses from directly or indirectly using or engaging any other person, including a virtual currency control services vendor, to store or hold virtual currency for or on behalf of a customer—unless the other person was a licensed money transmitter, a qualified bank or credit union, or approved by the banking commissioner to do so. The bill defined a “virtual currency control services vendor” as someone who controls virtual currency under an agreement with another person who assumes control of this currency on a third person’s behalf. Under existing law, businesses that engaged in money transmission in Connecticut by receiving, sending, storing, or maintaining custody or control of crypto on behalf of another person were required at all times to hold digital assets of the same type and amount owed or obligated to the other person. The bill also specified that this virtual currency was a property interest of any claimants against the crypto businesses on a proportional basis and in the type and amount to which the claimants were entitled, regardless of when the claimants became entitled or the businesses obtained control. Connecticut law requires crypto businesses to disclose transaction data The new law required businesses engaged in money transmission in Connecticut to provide specific disclosures and receipts for these transactions. However, the bill authorized the banking commissioner to waive any of these requirements and approve an alternative disclosure or receipt proposed by a crypto business if he/she determined that the alternative was more appropriate for the business and gave the same information and protection to the public. In the absence of an approved alternative disclosure, the bill required businesses to provide several disclosures before entering into a crypto transaction for, on behalf of, or with a person. Specifically, the businesses must clearly disclose relevant details to the extent applicable to the transaction. The Connecticut new law also requires businesses to give people specific receipts once the transactions are completed. The receipt must include the business’s name, contact information, and a description of how a person may ask a question or file a complaint. The details also include the transaction’s type, date, precise time, and value in U.S. dollars, and any consideration the business charged for the transaction, including any charge, fee, or commission, and the amount of any difference between the price the person paid for the virtual currency and its prevailing market price.

2025-06-11T10:09:17,"Why are crypto coins like Kaia, Jito, Vaulta, and SPX6900 rising?","Cryptocurrencies held steady on Wednesday after the conclusion of China and US talks in London, and as traders waited for the upcoming US May consumer inflation report. This article explores why some coins like Kaia (KAIA), Jito (JTO), Vaulta (A), and SPX6900 (SPX) are rising. Kaia jumps as it enters stablecoin race Kaia is an Asian blockchain company formed from the merger of Klaytn and Finschia earlier this year. The two projects were created by Kakao and LINE, respectively, two of the biggest tech companies in South Korea. Kaia has the lowest transaction costs and high speeds and is widely used by application developers in the country. The KAIA token price surged to a high of $0.1700, its highest point since February, and 85% above its lowest level this year. Its recent surge happened after the developers said that they were entering the stablecoin race by launching the first KRW-backed stablecoin. The announcement came a week after Circle, the creator of USDC went public in the United States in a highly successful offering that has pushed its market cap to over $25 billion. A KRW stablecoin would likely be successful because of the volume that South Koreans transact with on the blockchain. Data shows that they are the third most active users after the United States and China. Kaia price chart | Source: TradingView Vaulta rises as Bullish files for IPO Vaulta, formerly known as EOS, jumped to a high of $0.6910, its highest point since May 30, and 23% above its lowest point this month. This surge happened after Bullish, the crypto project backed by Peter Thiel, filed papers to go public. It joins other exchanges like Gemini and Kraken that have filed to go public this year following the Circle IPO . Vaulta token rose because it has a history with Bullish. Bullish was launched by Block.one, a company that launched the most successful ICO ever. Block was the founder of EOSIO until the relationship soured, with EOS citing underfunding by Block. Vaulta rebranded from EOS this year as it pivoted its business model to now focus on blockchain banking. Jito price rises amid asset and fee growth Jito, the biggest liquid staking platform on Solana, surged to a high of $2.3090 on Wednesday, its highest point since April 2nd. It has jumped by 50% from its lowest point in April. Data shows that the amount staked in Jito has continued rising this week. It now has over $2.97 billion in assets, up from $2.6 billion last week. Jito is also one of the most profitable players in the crypto industry, making over $70 million in fees in May, up from $50 million in April. SPX6900 price surges as momentum continues Meanwhile, the SPX6900 token price surged to a high of $1.64, its highest level since January 20th. It has jumped by over 478% from its lowest point this year. SPX token jumped because of the ongoing meme coin rebound. It also rallied as smart money investors and whales continued accumulating the token, a sign that they expect it to keep rising.

2025-06-11T10:07:47,"Bitcoin Price Surge Incoming? Bernstein Calls $200K Target “Conservative” As CNBC Eyes $130K+","Bitcoin’s meteoric rise continues to attract institutional investors and market analysts, with leading financial firms now painting an increasingly bullish pattern that suggests the current $109,000 Bitcoin price point may be the beginning of a new all-time high. Bernstein, the $800 billion asset management giant, has boldly declared their $200,000 Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 as notably “conservative,” while CNBC analysts project even more short-term ambitious targets reaching $135,000. This convergence of institutional optimism comes as Bitcoin trades just 4% below its latest all-time high, set on May 22. According to the Cryptonews price index , the crypto is trading above $109K at the time of writing. Bitcoin Price Chart Source: Cryptonews Institutional Momentum Drives Market Confidence The institutional adoption story has reached a critical inflection point, with Bernstein analysts emphasizing that the current crypto market cycle began with Bitcoin’s institutionalization through spot ETF launches. These financial vehicles have legitimized Bitcoin in traditional investment portfolios and created massive demand, making their $200K target understated. JUST IN: $800 billion asset manager Bernstein says its $200,000 Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is ""conservative."" pic.twitter.com/GGLHWfOJQf — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) June 10, 2025 The success extends beyond Bitcoin, with Ethereum ETFs accumulating $9 billion in assets under management and recording $815 million in inflows over just 20 days. The macro environment further supports this institutional thesis, with steady U.S. bond yields despite tariff-driven inflation concerns, expected Federal Reserve rate cuts , and a weakening U.S. dollar all contributing to favorable conditions for growth-oriented assets like Bitcoin. Corporate adoption has reached new heights with major firms like Metaplanet and Strategy holding Bitcoin in record numbers, while Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy continues its aggressive accumulation strategy . This institutional infrastructure has created what CNBC analysts describe as “strong fundamental, macro and technical backdrops” supporting continued price appreciation. Bitcoin Technical Analysis Points to Explosive Breakout CNBC’s technical analysis reveals Bitcoin’s successful navigation through a classic range-bound consolidation between $93,000 and $105,000, followed by a false breakdown in March that trapped short sellers before the subsequent explosive breakout above $107,000. The pattern CNBC analysts explain indicates intense institutional buying pressure. MattC, an Engineer analyst, perfectly describes this pattern, suggesting that Bitcoin has entered the “outer space” territory with minimal historical resistance levels. Bitcoin Outer Space Chart Source: MattC on X The curve is a long-term exponential trend line that Bitcoin has been following, suggesting the current rally is part of a larger macro bull cycle. The fact that Bitcoin has broken into this “outer space” region suggests the next major resistance levels could be psychological round numbers like $120,000 or $130,000. More so, the volatility analysis using Average Percent True Range (APTR) shows particularly intriguing behavior, with low volatility readings of 8.5% on weekly charts and 3-4% on daily charts typically preceding major breakouts. Unlike traditional markets where volatility decreases during uptrends, Bitcoin exhibits the opposite behavior, with increasing volatility accompanying price advances. This unique characteristic, combined with Bitcoin’s approach to the triple-resistance level of $110,000, has led CNBC analysts to project a 100% Fibonacci target of $135,000. Furthermore, historical cycle analysis reveals Bitcoin’s adherence to four-year halving patterns, with peaks traditionally occurring in June of halving years. The current 2025 cycle shows Bitcoin breaking previous all-time high resistance levels around $200,000, suggesting the early stages of what could be the most significant bull run in Bitcoin’s history. BITCOIN Is ‘Bullish June Seasonality’ about to kick in?

Global liquidity continues to expand. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/BU2hCA6PmZ — Root (@therationalroot) June 9, 2025 Global liquidity analysis further supports this technical outlook. Bitcoin’s price strongly correlates with the expanding central bank money supply from major economies, currently showing positive growth of 5-10% year over year. In summary, Bitcoin appears positioned to transcend previous market cycles and establish a new ATH. Whether Bitcoin reaches Bernstein’s “conservative” $200,000 target or CNBC’s aggressive $135,000 projection, the convergence of these technical patterns already creates a foundation for Bitcoin’s continued increase.

2025-06-11T10:05:08,"Ethereum Makes a Big Attack: It Left Bitcoin Behind! – Analyst Gives Date for New ATH!","The largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), has upset its investors in recent years with its weak performance, but has made a big move in recent weeks. ETH, which has increased by approximately 5% in the last 24 hours, has approached $ 2,800. While Ethereum provided some relief to its investors with its rise, it also left Bitcoin behind. According to Coinglass data, the trading volume of Ethereum derivatives increased by 38% in 24 hours, reaching over $110 billion. Analysts said the increase was driven by continued strong inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs, renewed interest in DeFi, and positive news from the SEC. This data signals increasing institutional participation for Ethereum, with its $110 billion trading volume surpassing that of Bitcoin derivatives, which had $84.72 billion. While this increase in Ethereum derivatives trading volume comes along with the increase in ETH price, BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas said that ETH's transaction increase reflects structural growth and increasing institutional interest. “Ethereum's growth in transaction volume is not a momentary one; it reflects structural growth, institutional validation, and real utility, “ETH is no longer just the second largest crypto by market cap, it is becoming the cornerstone of the digital asset economy.” Lucas, who also explained his prediction about the Ethereum price, said that there is an increase on the horizon, but for now, the $ 2,800 support and $ 3,600 resistance are critical for the new ATH process. “In the short term, ETH is riding a bullish wave. Price action is bullish, but we are also eyeing key levels – resistance at $3,600, support around $2,800. “If staking-supported ETFs are approved later this year, that could push ETH into the $5,500-$6,700 range by December.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T10:00:50,"Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Price Retests $109,000, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Pullback","Bitcoin (BTC) is trying to reclaim a crucial area amid its recent price recovery, which could propel the flagship crypto toward new highs. Some analysts suggested that BTC is preparing for the “final resistance,” while others warned that it still risks a potential pullback to lower levels. Related Reading: Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 – Is A Recovery Around The Corner? Bitcoin Rally Eyes Next Resistance Bitcoin has finally regained significant bullish momentum after printing a massive daily candle on Monday. The flagship crypto recently lost its post-all-time high (ATH) range of $106,800-$109,700, sparking concern among some investors. Amid the recent market pullbacks, which began in late May, the flagship crypto also registered some volatility, losing key levels as support and hitting a one-month low near the $100,000 level last week. However, BTC reclaimed the $105,000 mark over the weekend before surging above the $106,800 crucial resistance on Monday. Following this performance, analyst Rekt Capital stated that Bitcoin has successfully retested the $104,400 re-accumulation range high resistance as new support for four weeks. He highlighted that BTC was “rebounding from this new support base in an effort to transition into Price Discovery again.” Additionally, Bitcoin ended its two-week downtrend, recording a Daily Close around the $110,500 area. Per the analyst, BTC “has skipped through the $106,600-$109,443 Daily Range entirely,” and is “once again positioning itself like in late May for a retest” of the range’s high as support, which propelled the price to its ATH last month. A daily close above the $109,443 level would set up BTC for a revisit of the “final Daily resistance,” around the $111,723 mark, before a new ATH. The analyst also affirmed that reclaiming the “final weekly resistance” of $108,900 as support would also add to BTC’s momentum. BTC In A ‘Dangerous Area’? Analyst Crypto Jelle suggested that turning the $108,000 price area into support could send Bitcoin to the price discovery phase, potentially targeting the $120,000 mark. He noted that previous unsuccessful breakout attempts failed to reclaim this level, but that the cryptocurrency is currently holding this area. Based on a multi-month pattern, Jelle also reaffirmed its $140,000-$150,000 target for BTC’s cycle top. The analyst highlighted a major inverted Head and Shoulders pattern forming since the end of 2024. According to the post, the pattern is “nearing completion” after the recent price drop formed the right shoulder, while the neckline sits around the $111,000 mark. A breakout above this level could send Bitcoin to Jelle’s cycle top target. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Altcoin Sherpa considers that BTC’s chart “looks pretty good” in the high-time timeframes, suggesting that he will be “bullish until shown otherwise.” However, he warned that Bitcoin is “still in a dangerous area” as it could drop to lower levels if it doesn’t reclaim the $110,000 level. To Sherpa, “it’s logical to assume some sort of pullback is going to come in the red supply zone,” which sits between the key resistance line and its ATH level. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez highlighted on X that BTC’s most important support area sits between the $102,770 and $106,090 levels, where 2.21 million addresses bought 1.39 million BTC. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $109,995, a 3.6% increase in the weekly timeframe.

2025-06-11T09:55:11,"Ukrainian lawmakers propose bill to let central bank hold Bitcoin","Lawmakers in Ukraine are currently reviewing the country’s first cryptocurrency reserve bill to allow the National Bank of Ukraine to hold Bitcoin and other crypto assets as part of its official reserves. On June 10, draft bill 13356 was submitted to Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. The bill, introduced by Member of Parliament Yaroslav Zhelezniak, amends an existing law, “On the National Bank of Ukraine,” to permit the inclusion of digital assets, such as Bitcoin, in state reserves alongside traditional assets, like gold and foreign currencies. However, it must be noted that the bill does not mandate the central bank to acquire crypto assets but grants it the authority to do so at its own discretion. Deatils of the bill According to Zhelezniak, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) would independently decide if, when, and how much of its reserves should be allocated to cryptocurrencies. Zhelezniak, who confirmed the proposal’s submission via his official Telegram channel, said the legislation is intended to bring Ukraine in line with global financial innovation trends and could help strengthen macroeconomic stability. According to him, proper management of crypto reserves could unlock new opportunities for Ukraine’s digital economy. The proposal follows earlier signals from Zhelezniak about plans to introduce a crypto reserve bill with support from industry stakeholders. While the lawmaker previously stated the initiative would focus solely on Bitcoin, the current draft broadens the scope to include other crypto assets as well, contradicting his earlier comments. Last month, Binance expressed support for Ukraine’s crypto reserve initiative. Regional head Kirill Khomyakov said the move could help fast-track regulatory clarity, provided it is accompanied by comprehensive digital asset legislation. If passed, the bill would make Ukraine the first European country to legally establish a state Bitcoin reserve. Other major central banks across Europe, like the Swiss National Bank, have so far rejected the idea of bitcoin as a reserve asset. Ukraine joins a list of jurisdictions, including Russia, El Salvador, Japan, Brazil, Pakistan, and the US, alongside states like Texas , Arizona, and New Hampshire , that have taken steps toward building crypto reserve strategies. Ukraine moves to regulate crypto Ukraine’s growing interest in a Bitcoin reserve also comes against the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions. Both Russia and Ukraine have turned to cryptocurrencies in recent years, with digital assets playing a role in cross-border donations, fundraising, and capital movement during conflict-related disruptions. Ukraine has been actively working to reshape its digital asset regulations in recent months. In April, a draft law on virtual assets secured unanimous approval from the Verkhovna Rada’s Finance, Tax and Customs Policy Committee. However, the legislation was subsequently pulled from the agenda, reportedly at the request of the President’s Office. Despite this, the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission has moved forward with proposals to tax crypto gains. In a recent consultation paper, the regulator recommended a 23% tax on individual crypto income, comprising an 18% personal income tax and a 5% military levy. The commission has also advocated for simplified tax reporting systems and digital tools to help users comply with obligations, especially as many individuals may be unaware of their tax liabilities from crypto activity.

2025-06-11T09:40:00,"BTC and SOL bulls are eyeing MUTM as their next high-upside play","Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) have long held the spotlight in the crypto market, drawing in millions of investors with their impressive bull runs. But today, the narrative is shifting. With BTC’s growth now focused on preservation rather than multiplication and SOL showing signs of consolidation after a rapid climb, large crypto holders are actively looking for new, high-upside opportunities. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the picture—offering a compelling mix of early-phase pricing, real decentralized finance (DeFi) utility, and a roadmap already in motion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale, is building a non-custodial DeFi protocol that combines both peer-to-peer (P2P) and pool-to-contract (P2C) lending. Backed by an 80.00 CertiK audit and a beta platform on the verge of rollout, the project is gaining attention from smart investors who understand that the real returns now lie in undervalued, low-market-cap projects with strong fundamentals. The case for reallocation: stability vs growth Bitcoin (BTC) is widely accepted as a digital store of value, while Solana (SOL) has positioned itself as a high-speed blockchain platform for decentralized apps. Yet, both assets are now seen as relatively mature. Their upside is slower and less dramatic compared to what early-stage projects can offer. Investors with large positions in BTC and SOL are reallocating a portion of their portfolios into emerging protocols that offer not just upside, but also real, working income models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) answers that call by delivering on-chain lending without the middleman, flexible income options, and access to both blue-chip tokens and volatile meme coins like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB—all within one DeFi platform. It’s this kind of utility that high-cap holders are now favoring as they seek growth beyond price speculation. Unlike BTC or SOL, which are already in circulation and tied to market cycles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a transparent and ascending presale model. The token is currently priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 and will gradually rise through eleven total phases until reaching $0.06 by the final presale phase—doubling from its current value before exchange listing. That structured increase means early participants are set to lock in up to 2x returns even before the token goes live. For example, an investor who secured $2,000 worth of MUTM at the current price of $0.03 will watch that value grow into $4,000 when the token hits $0.06 at the end of the presale. Over $10.25 million has already been raised, and more than 11,850 holders have joined the ecosystem—clearly signaling growing interest and momentum before the token even hits exchanges. Real utility from day one: lending for Both P2P and P2C What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from typical presale projects is its functional ecosystem. The protocol allows users to lend and borrow across both peer-to-peer (P2P) and pool-to-contract (P2C) models. Lenders earn returns while borrowers gain liquidity without needing to exit their positions. Unlike speculative tokens, Mutuum enables actual use cases. Lenders are not just parking tokens—they’re contributing to a liquidity engine that supports a wide range of asset-backed loans. The P2P model allows users to lend directly to other users for tokens that often go unsupported on traditional platforms, including meme coins and other high-volatility assets. Meanwhile, the P2C system provides a more automated, liquidity-pool-based primary solution for stable tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emphasizes freedom and control. There are no deposit caps, and the platform is fully non-custodial, meaning users retain full ownership of their assets at all times. This is crucial for institutional and high-net-worth investors who require transparent on-chain execution and complete asset custody. Rather than creating artificial restrictions or custodial risk, Mutuum is structured to attract serious DeFi participants looking to earn passively on their capital in a secure and scalable system. Secure passive income via buybacks and staking The platform’s long-term value is reinforced through staking rewards funded by protocol-generated revenue buybacks. Users who stake their mtTokens—which represent deposits in Mutuum’s liquidity pools—become eligible for passive dividends. These dividends are distributed whenever the protocol uses a portion of its revenue to buy MUTM tokens on the open market and send them to safety module participants. This creates a sustainable income loop that rewards long-term participation. The model appeals to long-term crypto holders—such as those from BTC or SOL ecosystems—who now seek yield-generating strategies without needing to sell or trade actively. Security is non-negotiable for large investors, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already passed a complete CertiK audit, receiving a respectable score of 80.00. This indicates strong contract security and trustworthiness—qualities often missing in early-stage DeFi projects. Adding to that, the beta launch of the Mutuum platform is just around the corner. This means that investors will not have to wait months or years to see a working product for testing. Looking ahead, besides the ongoing $100K giveaway , Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already announced plans for Layer-2 integration, aimed at reducing gas fees and improving scalability across the protocol. In addition, a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin is in development, intended to support internal lending and repayments with maximum on-chain transparency. Both features are major steps toward long-term sustainability and signal the team’s commitment to creating an expansive ecosystem—not just a one-feature platform. Why high-cap crypto holders are joining early The combination of transparent tokenomics, actual platform utility, passive income mechanics, and a presale structure designed for 2x returns is too strong to ignore. Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) holders are entering Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because it offers the best of both worlds: long-term stability through staking and income, and short-term upside through strategic early entry. With $0.03 entry pricing still live and platform milestones already being achieved, Mutuum is in the sweet spot where opportunity meets execution. The upside is real, and the timeline is short.

The trader, identified by wallet address “0x1f25…”, created a new wallet and initially deposited 10M USDC to Hyperliquid, opening a 20x leveraged long position on Bitcoin. They then added another 2.35M USDC yesterday, followed by another 10M USDC today. At press time, the position stood at 3,877 BTC ($424.7M) with an entry price of $108,622 and a liquidation price of $103,100. The trader is currently showing unrealized gains of $3.59M. “0x1f25…” wallet. Source: Hypurrscan.io Bitcoin bulls target $150,000 after breaking key resistance The whale’s aggressive positioning comes as Bitcoin surged past the $110,000 mark, with analysts suggesting the next potential target could be $150,000 if technical indicators continue to align. Prominent crypto analyst TradingShot observed that Bitcoin’s current rally has invalidated several short-term bearish patterns and broken through a critical resistance zone. The analyst noted that Bitcoin recently rebounded at the lower high trendline of a three-year ascending channel, with this price structure appearing thrice in Bitcoin’s ongoing ‘channel up’ formation. Each instance triggered at least a 101% gain. From the April 7 bottom, a 101% rally would put Bitcoin at the $150,000 mark, a clean technical target supported by historical precedent, strong channel support, and renewed breakout momentum . Analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicted that the current phase is likely a short consolidation period before increased upward momentum. Van de Poppe suggests the ideal buying range sits around $107,000 to $108,000 as BTC prepares for what could be another historic run. If Bitcoin’s relative strength index ( RSI ) retests 75 by the end of the month, analyst PlanB suggests the June closing price for BTC would be around $130,000. Meanwhile, investment firm Bernstein maintains a $200,000 price target, calling it a “high-conviction but conservative” forecast. Institutional demand remains strong, with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) (NASDAQ: MSTR ) buying over 1000 BTC this week, worth approximately $110.2 million in total. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now manage over $120 billion in assets, highlighting BTC’s transition into a mainstream asset class.

2025-06-11T09:35:18,"BTC: The Most Cost-Effective Way To Buy Bitcoin","Summary Bitcoin has been the primary beneficiary of investment capital in the Digital Asset space since the approval of spot ETFs in early 2024. June is showing a potential change in sentiment, with negative net flow through June 7th. With Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust being a notable exception, most US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs have negative BTC-denominated AUM growth year to date. BTC remains a cost-effective way to get exposure to an anti-fiat debasement trade in 2025. Through the first week of June, Digital Asset investment net flows came in at $224 million. While this was the seventh consecutive week of positive net flow in the asset class, the week ended June 7th saw the weakest inflow story in nearly two months. Furthermore, if you take out iShares ETF products, year to date net flow into Digital Assets is actually negative. In this article, covering the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF ( BTC ), we'll look at capital flow trends in the Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) ETF products, issuer flows, as well as broader considerations for investors interested in Bitcoin. Capital Flow Winners and Losers There is no doubt at this point that Bitcoin has been the primary beneficiary of investment capital in the Digital Asset space since the approval of spot ETFs in early-2024. That outperformance continued through the first 5 months of 2025 with Bitcoin accounting for roughly 90% of year to date net flow and 86% of the Digital Asset financial product AUM: Asset (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin -$57 $10,143 $151,223 Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) $296 $1,701 $14,092 Multi-asset -$5.9 -$142 $6,763 Solana ( SOL-USD ) -$1.1 $79 $1,403 XRP ( XRP-USD ) -$4.0 $194 $1,216 Total $225 $11,342 $175,869 Source: CoinShares, as of June, 7th 2025 However, June is showing a potential change in sentiment, with many of the high-fliers from the last 12–18 months showing negative net flow through June 7th. This is happening while Ethereum - a hugely disappointing laggard post-ETF approvals - masked what would have been a week of negative net outflow were it not for inflow of just under $300 million through the first seven days of the month. Admittedly, this is just one week of data in a longer-term story. But it's interesting to me, nonetheless. The provider details are also quite telling because one product issuer is essentially the entire market so far this year and in June as well: Provider (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM iShares $330 $12,732 $72,844 Grayscale -$16 -$1,741 $29,339 Fidelity -$168 -$274 $20,511 ARK 21 Shrs -$25 -$47 $4,789 Bitwise -$13 -$273 $4,219 Total $225 $11,342 $175,869 Source: CoinShares, as of June, 7th 2025 Were it not for the $330 million month to date net flows into iShares products, investment in Digital Asset ETFs would have been negative through the first week of June. Unlike the asset breakout, this is not a new trend. The year to date story is quite similar with $12.7 billion in positive net flows year to date while most of the other major asset managers have actually seen outflow. This is indeed the case for Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise. This would seemingly indicate that it is the asset class itself, rather than a simple 'fee flight' migration from Grayscale products. ETF BTC Balances 12/31/2024 7/9/2025 Change YoY iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) 552,168 662,707 110,539 20.0% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ( FBTC ) 202,800 196,264 -6,536 -3.2% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ( ARKB ) 46,729 45,616 -1,113 -2.4% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) 40,196 37,783 -2,413 -6.0% BTC 38,342 43,436 5,094 13.3% Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) 206,835 185,234 -21,601 -10.4% Total Spot ETFs 1,286,857 1,365,429 78,572 6.1% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The clear outlier in this table is IBIT with the 20% year to date change in BTC holdings. Grayscale's Mini Trust, which is up 13.3% in BTC-denominated holdings, has jumped BITB as a 'top-5' fund this year by AUM but has failed to make up for the 21.6k Bitcoins that have come out of Grayscale's flagship Bitcoin product. If it was just a 'fee flight' story, I would think Grayscale's Mini Trust would be a bigger beneficiary of asset flow than IBIT: Fund Comparison Inception Expense Ratio AUM IBIT 01/05/2024 0.25% $71.85 ARKB 01/10/2024 0.21% $4.97 FBTC 01/10/2024 0.25% $20.49 BITB 01/10/2024 0.20% $4.10 GBTC 09/25/2013 1.50% $20.13 BTC 07/31/2024 0.15% $4.73 Source: Seeking Alpha, June 10th 2025, AUM in billions While still far more competitive than the 1.5% expense ratio seen through GBTC, IBIT is more expensive than Grayscale's Mini Trust and two additional offerings with top 5 AUM. Grayscale's Mini Trust is the most cost-effective, with just a .15% expense ratio. Data by YCharts If we look at the total return of both IBIT and BTC since the inception of the latter at the end of July 2024, we do indeed see BTC gets a very slight edge in total return. For a 'set it and forget it' type of investor, BTC will ultimately outperform IBIT since it's 10 bps cheaper annually. That said, this is not necessarily a meaningful boost in return for an asset that has appreciated in value by over 66% in the last 11 months. For those who want liquidity, IBIT is the clear winner. But for longer-term Bitcoin bulls, BTC will work perfectly fine. Cycle Top and Global Liquidity In previous articles for Seeking Alpha covering Bitcoin and cyclical sell indicators, we've looked at metrics like MVRV and Pi Cycle Top. From where I sit, the fundamental argument for Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment network isn't all that compelling, given the lackluster growth in usage and scaling. However, the belief by many that Bitcoin is 'Digital Gold' continues to carry the asset as an 'anti-fiat currency' instrument. As I see it, that view is still a winning one until price returns stop moving with global M2: BTC vs M2 (BGeometrics) I still like this chart quite a bit, and it shows Bitcoin price appreciation could realistically be looked at as a liquidity sponge when global M2 starts to surge on a year-over-year basis. Isolating down to the last 12 months shows Bitcoin's price moving with a lag when global M2 growth hits 7% year over year: BTC vs M2, 1 yr (BGeometrics) Our first example shows M2 growth at 7% in late September 2024. This preceded a 67% rip higher in BTC from $63k to $105k in December. We again saw 7% YoY growth in global M2 at the end of April. Bitcoin's return since then is slightly above 11%. Notably, M2 growth does not appear to be slowing down just yet, with the YoY change again hitting 7.5% as of June 2nd. Should history repeat, we could reasonably expect a Bitcoin price closer to $158k later this summer. Risks The old adage fits here; past performance is not a forecast of future returns. Just because money printing by global governments/central banks has produced higher Bitcoin prices so far, it doesn't necessarily mean that dynamic will continue. Bitcoin was initially intended to be a monetary asset for the people to use on-chain and with each other. 'HODLing' via ETFs isn't exactly what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. Furthermore, Bitcoin remains a new asset relative to historical fiat currency substitutes: Bitcoin/Gold Ratio ( Longtermtrends ) Measured against Gold, Bitcoin hasn't gone anywhere since November 2021. I will reiterate what I've said since I first started covering Bitcoin for Seeking Alpha several years ago; those seeking refuge from fiat currency debasement don't need to pick between the two when they can just buy both Bitcoin and Gold. Closing Summary I remain long Bitcoin both directly and through the ETF wrapper. While I personally like FBTC for my long-term position, I think Grayscale's Mini Trust is a perfectly fine way to allocate to Bitcoin in a traditional investment account. BTC is the most cost-effective way to buy that exposure, and I believe the fact that BTC is the only major spot ETF that has seen positive year to date inflows is a testament to that cost-effectiveness.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793978-btc-the-most-cost-effective-way-to-buy-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|TRADING","BTC-USD|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T09:34:00,"Ukraine Drafts Bill to Let Central Bank Hold Bitcoin in National Reserves","Ukraine lawmakers have introduced a draft bill that could allow the country’s central bank to include Bitcoin and other crypto in its national reserves. The bill, submitted on June 10, was put forward by a group of Members of Parliament led by Yaroslav Zheleznyak from the Holos party. It proposes amendments to the law “On the National Bank of Ukraine,” specifically to permit the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to hold virtual assets alongside gold and foreign currencies. Ukraine’s Central Bank May Soon Hold Crypto — If It Chooses To The draft law, registered as bill No. 13356 , does not require the central bank to invest in crypto. Instead, it gives the NBU the option to do so at its own discretion. Decisions about whether to allocate reserves into digital assets, such as when, how, or how much, would remain entirely with the bank. “Under this draft law, we authorize the National Bank of Ukraine to include virtual assets in the country’s reserves,” Zheleznyak said. “However, decisions regarding the timing, method, and volume of such inclusion are left entirely to the discretion of the central bank.” JUST IN: Ukraine officially introduces bill to establish a Strategic BTC Reserve. pic.twitter.com/VlxcXnwz9N — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) June 11, 2025 The proposal marks a notable shift in Ukraine’s stance toward integrating digital assets into its financial framework. Although the bill does not mandate the use of crypto in reserves, it creates a legal foundation for the NBU to act if it chooses to in the future. “If [the National Bank] doesn’t want to invest in crypto, it doesn’t have to,” Zheleznyak clarified. The draft bill reflects broader interest among Ukrainian lawmakers in aligning the country with global trends in financial innovation. Zheleznyak said a state-backed crypto reserve could support macroeconomic stability and help drive the growth of Ukraine’s digital economy. “Proper management of crypto reserves will help strengthen macroeconomic stability and create new opportunities for the development of the digital economy,” he wrote on Telegram. In a video discussion with Binance’s regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, Kirill Khomyakov, Zheleznyak highlighted growing international interest in crypto as a reserve asset. He pointed to countries like the United States, El Salvador, Switzerland, and Brazil as examples of jurisdictions moving toward strategic digital asset holdings. The bill has been submitted to Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, and is now awaiting further consideration. If passed, it would position Ukraine among a small but growing group of nations exploring crypto’s role in sovereign monetary policy. Ukraine Finalizing Crypto Legalization Bill Amid Plans for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Ukraine is preparing to take another major step toward integrating crypto into its national financial framework. Following the central bank’s move to potentially hold Bitcoin in its reserves, lawmakers are now pushing to legalize cryptocurrency use nationwide by mid-2025. The draft legislation, expected to be submitted after the New Year, has been developed with input from the National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund. Ukraine plans to legalize crypto by Q1 2025, with profits taxed similarly to securities with IMF and European expert guidance. #ukraine #crypto https://t.co/0hJPWs511R — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 12, 2024 It proposes a regulatory and tax framework that treats crypto assets similarly to securities, profits would be taxed only upon conversion to fiat, with no exemptions granted for digital asset transactions. Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the parliamentary Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy, said the bill is nearly ready for its first reading . While some regulatory details, such as financial monitoring mechanisms, are still under discussion, Hetmantsev stated that the core of the bill is complete and on track for approval in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s ambitions extend beyond regulation. Lawmakers are also drafting legislation that would enable the country to establish a strategic national Bitcoin reserve . Yaroslav Zhelezniak, deputy head of the finance committee, confirmed the bill is in its final stages and will soon be introduced. If passed, Ukraine would become the first European country to officially hold Bitcoin as a state asset, a move that could position the nation as a leader in institutional crypto adoption.

The firm announced Wednesday it has partnered with layer-1 blockchain Flare FLR to deploy $100 million XRP to generate yield on its treasury holdings. The initiative marks the first large-scale use of Flare’s FAssets system, which enables non-smart contract tokens like XRP to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, the press release said. VivoPower plans to generate yield through Flare-native protocols such as Firelight and reinvest the income to expand its XRP holdings. The company said it will also adopt payment firm Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin as its cash-equivalent reserve. ""It’s no longer enough to simply hold XRP; the duty to our shareholders is to make it productive,"" CEO and executive chairman Kevin Chin said in a statement. ""Adopting Ripple’s RLUSD is a cornerstone of this strategy, providing the stability and compliance this next-generation treasury demands."" For Flare, the deal is a milestone of institutional validation, Flare co-founder Hugo Philion pointed out. ""Our FAssets system [...] is more than just a bridge; it’s a gateway that allows institutions to bring assets like XRP into programmable DeFi environments to generate yield, all while retaining their fundamental security,"" he said. VivoPower is part of the growing roster of public firms raising money to purchase and add digital assets to their treasuries, a playbook popularized by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) that has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin BTC. The firm's latest move comes shortly after tapping BitGo's over-the-counter trading desk for acquiring an initial $100 million trench of XRP tokens. VivoPower last month said that it entered into an agreement for a $121 million private share placement, with the fundraising led by Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, chairman of Eleventh Holding Company, according to a SEC filing .",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/11/vivopower-to-deploy-usd100m-in-xrp-on-flare-add-ripple-usd-for-treasury-operations,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP","Finance|XRP|Flare Network|Ripple|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T09:28:59,"Millionaire-Maker Opportunity: Bitcoin Solaris Presale at $5 Before Projected 20X Growth in 2026","In the early days of Bitcoin, it wasn’t the technology that made headlines — it was the results. Regular people who saw the opportunity and acted early changed their financial lives forever. Now, a new project is capturing that same attention. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), currently in Phase 7 of its presale at $7, has already created a buzz by offering exactly what early Bitcoin once did: a chance to step in before the real acceleration begins. The entry window at $5 is officially behind us — but the opportunity hasn’t closed. Analysts predict the token could hit $100 by 2026, and with a hard cap of 21 million tokens and growing participation, many believe the launch price will be just the start of a much longer climb. $1,000 Could Mean $20,000 or More Let’s be clear: Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a speculative token built on hype. The current presale structure — now past $3.8 million in contributions from over 11,000 participants — is based on capped supply, real user incentives, and a model that rewards contribution, not just holding. At the current $7 token price, a $1,000 allocation secures roughly 142 BTC-S. With public listings expected at $20, that alone represents a projected 185% return — before any long-term appreciation. But the reason analysts are pointing to BTC-S as a millionaire-maker isn’t the jump from presale to launch. It’s the runway after. Ben Crypto, a widely followed market analyst, recently broke down his full BTC-S forecast in a YouTube video — watch it here . His projection? If adoption follows the same curve seen in early Bitcoin — where network use, supply mechanics, and demand created natural lift — BTC-S could climb to $100 or beyond in under two years. That means the current $1,000 investment could realistically turn into $20,000. And if token adoption expands further, the upside grows with it. Scarcity Is Already in Play BTC-S has a maximum supply of 21 million tokens — the same hard limit that gave Bitcoin its deflationary strength. But only 4.2 million of those are allocated to presale phases. There are no hidden reserve wallets, no future minting functions, and no emissions curve waiting to dilute value after launch. What exists is what will exist. That fixed model is what gives current investors real leverage. As the network grows and post-launch mining increases demand, those with early allocations stand to benefit not only from token price increases, but also from reduced mining difficulty and increased rewards. The Price Momentum Is Already Real When Bitcoin Solaris opened its early phases at $5, the response was immediate. More than 11,000 unique buyers have entered across presale stages. Social media volume spiked, independent YouTubers and analysts began publishing predictions, and investor groups started referencing BTC-S alongside legacy projects like Bitcoin and Solana. But what makes this momentum sustainable isn’t marketing. It’s structure. The presale isn’t based on vague promises — it’s built on verified mechanics and visible infrastructure. BTC-S smart contracts have passed a full Cyberscope audit , while its mining backend — which allows mobile mining — was independently validated by Freshcoins . The team behind the project has also completed KYC verification , eliminating the anonymity risk that plagues many new tokens. A Crowded Market Needs Clear Winners Investors are overwhelmed by options in 2025 — meme coins, overhyped L2s, “future utility” tokens. Most are chasing short-term attention, not long-term value. Bitcoin Solaris has managed to break through this noise by offering the fundamentals that early adopters care about: limited supply, real accessibility, and early-mover reward potential. And unlike tokens that lock users into staking contracts or require expensive equipment, BTC-S delivers utility from the start. Participants aren’t sidelined — they’re earning. No lockups. No waitlists. No guessing. Still Early — But Not For Long Phase 7 pricing sits at $7. Launch benchmarks are set at $20. And the next wave of user growth will likely come not from crypto insiders, but from mobile users globally who gain mining access for the first time. Once the presale allocation closes — and fewer tokens remain to meet future demand — pricing pressure will follow. And for those who waited too long? The chance to enter under $10 will be gone.

2025-06-11T09:28:38,"Bitcoin Pepe sees strong momentum as SOL ETFs may get approval soon","The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation rose 1% over the past 24 hours, extending its weekly gains to nearly 4% and reaching $3.45 trillion. If positive sentiment holds, the market appears poised to retest its all-time high near $3.7 trillion and Bitcoin Pepe is seeing strong momentum as SOL ETFs may get approval soon. The increasing dominance of institutional and professional capital has subdued retail-driven FOMO, contributing to a more orderly and sustainable market trajectory—a dynamic more favourable for long-term investors. Bitcoin is currently trading above $109,000, although upward momentum is facing resistance near the $110,000 mark. Selling pressure is expected to intensify as prices approach the $112,000 level, which represents the previous all-time high set in late May. As Bitcoin pushes toward new highs, retail investors are increasingly gravitating toward speculative tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe , now entering the final stretch of its presale. Momentum-driven capital is rotating into early-stage projects as traders seek assets offering asymmetric upside potential. This renewed appetite for risk is being fueled by a broader crypto rebound, supported by institutional inflows and a more favourable macroeconomic backdrop. SOL ETF approval around the corner? The US Securities and Exchange Commission has asked issuers of proposed spot Solana ETFs to update their S-1 filings, a move that may signal progress toward potential approval, according to Blockworks, citing sources familiar with the matter. Following last year’s approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, issuers have submitted a wave of applications for altcoin-based funds, including those tied to Solana (SOL), XRP, and others. While analysts say the odds of approval are rising, the SEC has yet to greenlight any spot ETFs beyond BTC and ETH. Just last month, the regulator extended its review period for spot Solana ETF applications from Bitwise and 21Shares, continuing its cautious approach to altcoin-linked funds. Bitcoin Pepe to benefit from broader crypto adoption The approval of a spot Solana ETF would bring much-needed visibility to the broader altcoin and meme coin markets, helping shift perceptions of these assets from speculation to more credible components of the digital asset ecosystem. Such a move could lend legitimacy to technically ambitious projects like Bitcoin Pepe, which aim to bridge the gap between novelty and utility in the meme coin space. By seeking to “build Solana on Bitcoin” and combining Bitcoin’s security with Solana-like scalability, Bitcoin Pepe stands out for offering more than just hype. The project has unveiled a slate of strategic partnerships to expand its Layer 2 ecosystem. These include Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. A collaboration with the GETE Network is also in the works, potentially bringing Bitcoin Pepe into the cross-chain Web3 gaming space. These developments are intended to strengthen the project’s technical infrastructure while introducing practical use cases for the token, setting it apart from meme tokens driven solely by speculation. Investor appetite appears strong. Bitcoin Pepe ’s ongoing presale has raised over $14 million, with BPEP tokens currently priced at $0.0416.

Here's Why…","The largest institutional Bitcoin bull Strategy (MicroStrategy) continues its aggressive buying. While Strategy's buying strategy was thought to be positive for BTC, a negative comment came from Swiss cryptocurrency bank Sygnum. Accordingly, Sygnum Bank said in a recent report that Strategy’s aggressive buying strategy could undermine Bitcoin’s safe haven status. Strategy’s goal of owning 5% of the BTC supply could undermine Bitcoin’s suitability as a reserve asset for central banks, according to the report. “Strategy's 3% stake in Bitcoin is approaching problematic levels, threatening Bitcoin's reserve asset status.” So far, Strategy has purchased a total of 582,000 Bitcoins, which is almost 3% of the BTC supply. The bank noted that Strategy leveraged the convertible bond to buy more BTC, as well as the momentum of its own stock price during bull runs. However, Sygnum Bank said that if the BTC price enters a prolonged decline and Strategy’s stock price falls below the conversion prices of its outstanding bonds, the structure that Strategy has set up will crack and it may be forced to liquidate some of its Bitcoin assets to meet its debt obligations. “If Strategy chooses to sell Bitcoin to avoid the additional burden of a stock decline, the outcome could be very damaging for the market.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T09:18:15,"RichMiner: Ordinary people rely on cloud mining to catch the “Trump economic express train”","As the policy direction after the 2025 US presidential election becomes clearer, crypto assets and digital energy-related industries are ushering in a new round of growth dividends. Especially after Trump once again proposed “revitalizing US energy sovereignty” and “promoting the liberalization of the digital economy”, cloud mining has become one of the industries that benefited significantly. With this favorable wind, global users are entering the mining market with a low threshold through platforms such as RichMiner, realizing the real “policy + technology” double dividend realization. Today, ordinary people are no longer just spectators, but with the help of cloud mining technology, they can easily catch this “Trump economic express train”. Trump supports Bitcoin and releases benefits to miners In multiple speeches and interviews, Trump emphasized the need to “bring Bitcoin mining back to the United States” and emphasized that “the United States should be the center of the global crypto mining industry.” This is a big boon to cloud mining platforms and mining infrastructure, especially services running in the United States or cooperative friendly countries. Trump said at a financial forum: “We can’t continue to let innovation flow to other countries. The United States must dominate crypto technology, not suppress it.” He supports the establishment of a regulatory system that can protect investors without excessively intervening in the market, which is a great boon to formal platforms such as cloud mining, exchanges, and wallet services. Trump said he would: legalize and encourage Bitcoin mining in the United States, support Bitcoin as a strategic asset, and protect users’ freedom to own and use digital assets This policy orientation provides fertile ground for the development of cloud mining platforms, and also gives ordinary users the opportunity to obtain long-term benefits like institutional investors.

2025-06-11T09:08:40,"Uniswap breaks out of inverse head-and-shoulders, targets 37% upside ahead","Uniswap is showing strong signs of a bullish reversal after breaking out of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart. According to data crypto.news, Uniswap ( UNI ) UNI shot up over 20% in the past 24 hours, hitting a high of $8.61 on June 11, up 84% from its April low. Its market cap has surpassed $5 billion, flipping that of Aave ( AAVE ). Meanwhile, its daily trading volume increased by more than 150% over the previous day to nearly $1.39 billion. In the derivatives market, open interest surged 54% to a record $713 million, showing that more traders are betting long. The long/short ratio is also above 1, which usually means more people are expecting prices to rise. From a technical standpoint, UNI appears poised for more sustained gains, having broken out of multiple bullish patterns on the daily chart. UNI broke out of an inverse head and shoulders and confirmed it with a strong bullish candle. It also formed a golden cross earlier this week, when the 20-day moving average crossed above the 50-day, a common buy signal, as reported earlier by crypto.news. UNI has broken out of an inverse head and shoulder pattern — June 11 | Source: crypto.news To add to the momentum, UNI has broken out of a months-long downtrend defined by lower highs and lower lows. It’s now above key resistance, and both the MACD and RSI indicators are trending upward. UNI MACD and RSI chart — June 11 | Source: crypto.news If the breakout stays intact, the inverse head and shoulders pattern points to a potential move toward $10.40, roughly 37% above current levels. That target also aligns with the 24.7% Fibonacci retracement level, adding more weight to its importance. You might also like: Myria token jumps as crypto market bounces in Bitcoin-led rally The ongoing rally appears to be driven in part by Uniswap’s June 10 announcement of its new Smart Wallet, which aims to streamline onchain interactions by removing manual token approvals and enabling features like gas abstraction. Further hopes of regulatory clarity in the U.S. may have further contributed to the bullish sentiment. On June 9, SEC Chair Paul Atkins indicated that the agency is working on an “innovation exemption” framework to ease DeFi platforms’ path to market. The announcement sparked renewed optimism across the cryptocurrency market, with many viewing it as a potential catalyst for a “DeFi Summer 2.0” revival. Since Uniswap is one of the largest and most widely used decentralized exchanges, it has been particularly responsive to these developments. Daily active addresses on the Uniswap network have surged 92% in the past 24 hours, a strong signal that user engagement is rebounding as bullish momentum builds. UNI’s rally is also being supported by Bitcoin’s recovery, which saw the asset climb above $110,000 on hopes tied to U.S.–China trade negotiations in London. Even with strong momentum and bullish indicators, traders are closely watching a key support level at $8.20, which corresponds to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement. This level often acts as the first line of support during a healthy uptrend, making it a critical zone to hold for continued bullish momentum. A drop below this may trigger short-term consolidation or a minor pullback before the uptrend resumes. But a decisive move below $7.50 would invalidate the current bullish structure. In that case, UNI could retrace further toward $4.70, where stronger buying interest might re-emerge.

2025-06-11T09:01:41,"Bitcoin Winter Is Over, Says Michael Saylor","With just 450 BTC mined daily and public companies like his own aggressively acquiring Bitcoin, Saylor argues the supply-demand imbalance is driving inevitable price appreciation. He also mentioned the growing political and institutional support, including pro-Bitcoin stances from Donald Trump and key financial regulators. Meanwhile, analysts believe that a wave of crypto ETF approvals could trigger an “ETF summer.” However, not all corporate crypto bets have paid off. GameStop’s recent $513 million BTC purchase failed to boost Q1 performance. No More Crypto Winter? Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, dismissed people’s fears of another crypto market winter by saying that Bitcoin’s trajectory is now locked toward $1 million due to its accelerating adoption and limited supply. In a recent Bloomberg interview , Saylor confidently stated, “Winter is not coming back,” and he argued that Bitcoin reached a point where the only logical direction is upwards. He also talked about the sharp contrast in supply and demand, and explained that just 450 Bitcoin are made available by miners each day, which is roughly equivalent to $50 million at current prices. If this daily supply continues to be absorbed, Saylor believes the price will be forced to rise. Saylor spoke about how public companies, including his own, are playing a key role in driving up demand. In fact, Strategy purchased 582,000 Bitcoin since 2020, which is now worth around $63.85 billion. According to Saylor, these firms are “buying the entire natural supply,” and only a relatively small daily investment is needed to impact the market. However, he acknowledged that if Bitcoin does soar to $500,000 or even $1 million, large-scale volatility could return. Strategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: Saylor Tracker ) Pointing to macroeconomic and political tailwinds, Saylor explained that the broader environment now supports Bitcoin. He pointed to recent endorsements from US President Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and SEC Chair Paul Atkins, all of whom expressed strong institutional backing for the crypto king. He also pointed out that traditional banks are preparing to offer Bitcoin custody, which is a big step toward mainstream adoption. While Trump expressed his support for Bitcoin, some of his policy decisions were seen as catalysts for short-term price declines, including a 40% drop from Bitcoin’s January peak of $109,000. Still, Saylor is unfazed and sees these fluctuations as part of a broader upward trend. Additionally, he mentioned the role of Bitcoin ETFs, particularly those led by BlackRock and other major players, in driving daily Bitcoin purchases. In his view, these inflows , along with new entrants like nation-states, reinforce the bullish outlook. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) For example, Pakistan recently signaled its intent to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which is a move that Samson Mow of JAN3 suggested could allow the country to “front-run” the US if it doesn’t act swiftly. Trump’s creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in March could help the US stay in the race, but Saylor’s message is clear: the momentum behind Bitcoin is too strong to ignore, and the conditions are aligning for a historic price surge. Altcoin ETF Summer Could Start Soon The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be on the verge of approving a new wave of crypto-linked ETFs, and analysts believe this could be the potential start of an “ altcoin ETF summer ” as early as next month. According to a note that was shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart and senior analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC could approve ETFs tracking broad crypto indexes in July, with Solana likely leading the way. These ETFs aim to provide diversified exposure to the cryptocurrency market. So far, Bloomberg analysts assigned a 90% chance of approval for the initial batch by July 2. Major players like Grayscale and Bitwise filed for these crypto bundle ETFs, and the SEC is also evaluating applications that focus specifically on Solana, XRP, and staking-based products. While decisions on Solana and staking ETFs could arrive later this year, there are signs the SEC might act sooner. Reports from Blockworks suggest that the SEC asked fund issuers to revise their Solana ETF filings, which indicates that there is active dialogue and growing momentum behind the products. Basket-style ETFs are seen as an attractive option for investors who are unsure which tokens will outperform. Duncan Moir, president of 21Shares, explained at the Proof of Talk event in Paris that basket products offer a way to gain market exposure without betting on a single asset. He expects these types of ETFs to become increasingly popular as more asset managers join the market and compete to launch innovative exchange-traded products. Seyffart’s forecast that Solana and staking ETFs will lead the next phase of ETF approvals coincides with broader optimism in the industry. Nate Geraci , president of the ETF Store, said that the SEC seems poised to “open the floodgates on crypto ETFs,” which could represent the final hurdle before major brokerages begin offering direct spot crypto trading. Looking further ahead, Balchunas also pointed out that there’s a strong likelihood that an actively managed meme coin ETF could debut by 2026. GameStop’s Bitcoin Bet Fails to Lift Q1 Although Saylor is convinced that a Bitcoin winteris a thing of the past, GameStop Corp reported mixed financial results for the first quarter ending May 3. After-hours trading also saw its shares drop more than 3.5% to just above $29. Q1 overview (Source: GameStop ) The company revealed a decline in revenue to $732.4 million, missing analyst expectations of $754.2 million and falling 17% from the $881.8 million that was posted during the same period last year. The drop was attributed to persistent challenges in physical game sales, according to brokerage IG. However, operational metrics showed improvement, with the company turning a profit of $44.8 million compared to a net loss of $32.3 million a year prior. Despite the revenue miss, GameStop’s cash position is still quite strong. The company reported $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which is a sharp increase from $1 billion a year ago. This financial strength comes at a time when the company is starting to pivot into Bitcoin investment. On May 28, GameStop revealed its first Bitcoin purchase of 4,710 BTC, valued at approximately $513 million at the time. The firm funded the acquisition through debt financing by launching a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. GameStop YTD stock price (Source: Google Finance ) While GameStop did not specify a long-term target for its Bitcoin holdings, it indicated flexibility as it may sell its Bitcoin if needed. The move places GameStop among the growing number of firms treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, although the stock declined roughly 3.8% year-to-date. The company’s all-time high of over $80 in January 2021 remains a far cry from current levels.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9523/bitcoin-winter-is-over-says-michael-saylor,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T09:00:47,"Bitcoin Back At $109,000, But HODLer Profit-Taking Down 89%","On-chain data shows the veterans of the Bitcoin market are taking 89% less profits compared to the May peak, despite prices being similar now. Bitcoin Realized Profit For 1Y+ Hands Is Relatively Low Right Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Realized Profit of the seasoned hands on the Bitcoin network. The “Realized Profit” refers to an indicator that measures, as its name implies, the amount of profit that the BTC investors are realizing through their selling. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being transacted or ‘sold’ on the chain to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If the previous selling value is less than the current price for any token, then that particular token’s sale is contributing to profit realization. Related Reading: Toncoin Heading Toward 40% Breakout, Pattern Could Suggest The amount of profit realized in the sale is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit sums up this value for all tokens being transferred to find the total for the network as a whole. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Profit of the entire userbase isn’t of interest, but just that of a specific part of it: the 1+ year holders. These are the investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than a year, without having involved them in a transaction even once. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their tokens, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. As such, this part of the userbase with its significant holding time would include the resolute diamond hands of the market. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Profit for these HODLers over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit of the 1+ year investors observed a huge spike in late May. This sharp profit-taking spree from these seasoned hands came as BTC surged to $110,000 following its post all-time high (ATH) pullback. Shortly after the selloff from this cohort, BTC started on a decline. During the past day, though, the asset has appeared to have finally shoved off this bearish momentum, as it has once more returned above the $109,000 mark. This time, however, there hasn’t been any significant reaction from the diamond hands. Currently, the 24-hour simple moving average (SMA) of the group’s Realized Profit sits at $13.6 million, which is 89% down compared to the $126 million peak from last month.

2025-06-11T08:55:57,"GameStop’s revenue dropped by 17% after pivot to BTC","GameStop saw its stock drop over 3.5% after-hours on Tuesday, after reporting a steep 17% decline in first-quarter revenue, landing at $732.4 million, down from $881.8 million a year earlier. This comes as the company pushes deeper into crypto while its core retail business keeps shrinking. Analysts had expected stronger performance at $754.2 million, but physical game sales and hardware demand continued to fall across the board. Despite the slump in revenue, the company reported a net income of $44.8 million, flipping from a $32.3 million net loss in the same quarter last year. Operating losses also narrowed significantly to $10.8 million, compared to $50.6 million in Q1 2024. But the financial upside didn’t move investors. GME shares slipped to just over $29, and have fallen 3.8% year-to-date. The decline came even after the company announced a major Bitcoin acquisition last month. GameStop buys Bitcoin, cuts stores, and dumps Canada On May 28, GameStop disclosed it had bought 4,710 bitcoins, spending about $513 million on the purchase. The company said the buy was funded through debt financing, and at the same time launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering to raise additional funds. It confirmed in March that the board had approved using Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Between May 3 and June 10, the entire 4,710 BTC was added to its books. But there’s still no word on how much more it might plan to buy—or when it might sell. While the company is throwing cash into crypto, its traditional operations are bleeding. It shut down nearly 600 stores in the U.S. in 2024, and just confirmed plans to close a “significant number” more in 2025. Hardware and accessories, which includes both new and used video games, saw a 32% revenue drop for the quarter. GameStop is also pulling out of other markets. It sold its Canadian business, known as Electronics Boutique Canada, in early May. That subsidiary ran all physical stores and the e-commerce platform across Canada. The company said it also expects the sale of its French operations to close sometime in fiscal year 2025. All these exits and shutdowns come as GameStop tries to cut costs. The company said the latest $10.8 million operating loss includes $35.5 million in impairment charges related to international restructuring. That means the numbers would have looked even better without the overseas shakeups. Revenue tanks, cash pile explodes, stock stays flat Even though GameStop is closing shops and losing retail momentum, it’s got more cash than ever. As of the latest report, the company holds $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, a massive jump from the $1 billion it held at the same point in 2024. That growing war chest could fund more Bitcoin purchases down the line, but management hasn’t laid out any targets yet. GameStop noted that it could choose to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings at any time if cash is needed. That conditional approach signals the investment might not be permanent. Meanwhile, the ecommerce platform has been expanded to support digital downloads and online merchandise, but there’s no indication yet that those upgrades are bringing in enough money to offset the losses in physical retail. No figures were broken out for online-only sales. All this is happening while the company’s stock still lags far below its $80 all-time high from January 2021, when WallStreetBets fueled one of the most chaotic retail trading frenzies in history. That hype has long worn off. GameStop is now left with a collapsing store footprint, a volatile new crypto balance sheet, and a pile of cash it hasn’t figured out how to use.

Introduced by Representative Mark Wright, the resolution was adopted following a June 10 Regular Session of the House of Representatives, where it passed with unanimous support in a 90–0 vote. HR 317 creates a new subcommittee under the House Committee on Commerce to assess how emerging technologies are shaping the state’s economy, legislation, and daily life. The subcommittee is required to begin its work before September 1, 2025, and submit a final report by February 1, 2026, to the House Committee on Commerce and the David R. Poynter Legislative Research Library. The report will include an analysis of current use cases for AI, blockchain, and cryptocurrency in Louisiana, as well as a comparison with developments in other US states. The panel is tasked with evaluating cybersecurity risks, privacy concerns, and regulatory challenges, alongside opportunities related to economic growth, workforce development, and public-sector innovation. It will also explore whether new state laws are needed to manage these technologies safely and effectively. You might also like: Elon Musk called it an “abomination” — but the Big Beautiful Bill might be crypto’s backdoor stimulus To support an inclusive review process, the resolution calls on the subcommittee to host public hearings and gather expert testimony, while also engaging educators, students, and business owners through dedicated community forums. The subcommittee will consist of members of the House Committee on Commerce, with the committee chair or a designee presiding over the first meeting. Over the years, Louisiana has firmly positioned itself as a pro-crypto pioneer . In September 2024, the state became the first in the U.S. to accept cryptocurrency payments for government services, allowing residents to pay fines and fees with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Lightning Network, and USD Coin. Representative Wright has continued to champion digital asset integration, having earlier authored a Bitcoin Rights bill that affirms citizens’ rights to transact in Bitcoin, prohibits central bank digital currency trials, and safeguards home-based crypto mining. However, Louisiana has not yet introduced legislation to establish a state-level Bitcoin reserve , a move other states are already pursuing. Neighbouring state Texas, for instance, recently passed Senate Bill 21, creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve managed by the state Comptroller, and it now awaits the governor’s approval .

2025-06-11T08:47:27,"Crypto Queen Senator Lummis Says Unfair Tax Laws Threaten Bitcoin","The post Crypto Queen Senator Lummis Says Unfair Tax Laws Threaten Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Senator Cynthia Lummis is on a mission to change the unfair crypto tax rules in the U.S. She believes that Bitcoin miners and DeFi users are getting a raw deal under the current system. Lummis says the tax rules are old and don’t work for the fast-growing world of digital assets. Let’s take a closer look at what’s going on and how this could change the game for crypto in America. Flawed Rules Target Crypto Investors Senator Lummis, known for championing crypto causes in Congress, says America’s tax system is too old for modern crypto businesses. She believes it’s stopping new ideas from growing and is hurting miners, who have to pay tax twice, once when they earn block rewards and again when they sell the coins. This double tax, Lummis argues, makes it hard for miners to make money and expand their businesses. But it’s not just miners who are struggling. DeFi users also worry because they might get taxed on every small transaction, even if they don’t make any real profit. Lummis says these unfair rules are holding crypto back, and it’s time to fix this. How Lummis Addresses This Problem To address these problems, Senator Cynthia Lummis is pushing Congress to use the reconciliation process. This method lets lawmakers pass changes quickly with a simple majority. Her mission is to narrow down the meaning of “broker” and remove extra rules that make it hard for crypto businesses to grow. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Admits DOGE Is ‘Here to Stay’ Despite Past Criticism , Senator Lummis has also introduced the BITCOIN Act , which aims to make Bitcoin a key part of the country’s financial plans. She said her office has already talked to the Senate Finance Committee to start these changes. Lawmakers Looking For Crypto Reforms Meanwhile, lawmakers in Washington are busy discussing a series of new crypto rules that could totally change how things work. This week, Congress is getting ready to vote on the GENIUS Act , while the CLARITY Act is also moving ahead. With all these plans in motion, there’s a growing feeling that Senator Lummis’s push for fairer crypto taxes might finally become reality. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-11T08:47:17,"Altcoins With Massive Gains and New ATHs as Bitcoin Flirts With $110K (Market Watch)","Bitcoin’s price attempted to take down the $110,000 level and perhaps head to a new all-time high once again hours ago, but it didn’t see much success. Many altcoins have posted mindblowing gains over the past 24-48 hours, led by Uniswap’s notable 16% surge and SPX’s 15% pump. BTC Flirts With New ATH The primary cryptocurrency experienced a substantial correction at the end of the past business week amid the public spat between US President Donald Trump and former ally Elon Musk. At the time, BTC plummeted to a multi-week low of under $100,500. Although some expected a breakdown to a five-digit price territory, the bulls stepped up and didn’t allow another decline. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover some ground and went back to $104,000-$106,000 during the weekend. The market started to pick up once the new business week began, and BTC shot above $110,500 on Tuesday for the first time in about 14 days . It was stopped there at first, but the bulls tried once again in the past 6 hours. However, to no avail so far, and BTC is back to just under $110,000. Here are the most vital support and resistance lines on the way to a fresh peak. For now, its market cap has remained sluggish at $2.180 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has been reduced to under 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView HYPE’s New ATH HYPE continues to be the rockstar of the altcoin space, registering frequent all-time highs. The latest came earlier today when the asset jumped to almost $43 after a double-digit surge. However, there are even bigger gainers over the past 24 hours, as UNI has soared by 16%, followed by SPX (15%), XDC (13%), OP (12%), A (12%), and ARB (11%). The top performers from the larger-cap altcoins include AAVE, BCH, LINK, SOL, and DOGE, with price increases of up to 7%. Ethereum soared to $2,800 earlier today but was stopped, while XRP continues to fight with the $2.3 resistance. The crypto market cap is up by almost $50 billion and now sits at $3.580 trillion.

2025-06-11T08:45:07,"Best crypto presales to buy as crypto reserve bill is introduced in Ukraine","The total crypto market capitalisation rose by 1% in the past 24 hours and is now up nearly 4% over the past week, reaching $3.45 trillion. This level marks a return to the consolidation zone seen a couple of weeks ago. The market’s current trajectory—a gradual, stepwise climb—suggests the next target could be the historical high near $3.7 trillion, assuming the prevailing positive sentiment holds. Unlike past bull runs fuelled by retail-driven FOMO, the latest rally is being shaped primarily by institutional and professional capital. As a result, the growth pattern resembles a measured ascent with frequent pauses rather than a parabolic surge. While less dramatic, this structure tends to be more sustainable and is often seen as more favourable for long-term holdings. As the broader market’s volatility declines and institutional adoption increases, top coins are looking less attractive to investors seeking outsized, asymmetric returns. That search for higher upside is driving renewed interest in early-stage tokens like Bitcoin Pepe , which are drawing risk-tolerant capital amid improving sentiment across the crypto market. As traders rotate into more speculative corners of the space, these high-volatility plays are emerging as key beneficiaries of the current momentum. Crypto reserve bill in Ukraine Ukrainian lawmakers have introduced a draft bill that could allow the country’s central bank to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in its official reserves. Tabled in the Verkhovna Rada on Tuesday, bill number 13356 proposes amendments to the existing law “On the National Bank of Ukraine,” expanding the list of permissible reserve assets to include crypto alongside traditional holdings like gold and foreign currencies. The legislation does not mandate crypto accumulation but grants the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) the authority to acquire digital assets such as Bitcoin at its own discretion. Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of parliament who confirmed the bill’s submission on Telegram, clarified that the central bank would retain full autonomy in deciding if, when, and how much crypto to hold in reserves. Bitcoin Pepe’s momentum remains strong Bitcoin’s sustained bullish momentum has lifted sentiment across the broader crypto market, setting the stage for conditions that have historically preceded wider rallies. In this risk-on environment, investors are again rotating into speculative plays, with meme coins among the early beneficiaries. Bitcoin Pepe is one such project gaining traction, drawing interest for its attempt to fuse viral internet culture with a serious Layer 2 blockchain proposition. Touted as one of 2025’s most closely watched crypto presales, Bitcoin Pepe has carved out a distinct identity with its ambition to “build Solana on Bitcoin”—a vision aimed at marrying Bitcoin’s network security with Solana-style scalability. Unlike many meme tokens that trade solely on hype, Bitcoin Pepe is anchored by a technical roadmap and infrastructure-driven narrative. The project has raised over $14 million in presale funding ahead of a planned listing announcement on June 17, underscoring strong investor appetite. As speculative capital continues to flow into early-stage assets, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself to capitalise on this momentum in the final stretch of its token sale.

2025-06-11T08:44:09,"Bitwise Announces Its Big Forecast for Bitcoin (BTC)! ""By the End of 2025…""","Even though the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is breaking new records, it is still considered to be below its fair value. At this point, Bitwise analysts André Dragosch and Ayush Tripathi finally explained the fair value of Bitcoin. Accordingly, analysts predict that Bitcoin could rise above $200,000 by the end of the year and reach its fair value of $230,000. Trump's proposed tax cuts and rising U.S. debt are the key drivers of the rally, analysts said, supporting Bitcoin's rise as a hedge against default risks. “Bitcoin’s scarcity and durability put it in a unique position to benefit from both financial instability and improving market sentiment. If these trends continue, the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin could end up shattering price expectations.” Analysts stated that Bitcoin fell to $100,000 with the tension between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, but recovered in a very short time, and said that the bull is solid and that it is a sign that the rise will continue. As a result, analysts have stated that they expect the rise to continue and rise to what they consider to be Bitcoin’s fair value of $230,000 by the end of 2025. Apart from Bitwise analysts, Bitwise CEO also announced his BTC price expectation. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley claimed that no one will sell when Bitcoin reaches $130,000-$150,000. In his post from the X account, Horsley said that if the Bitcoin price reaches $130,000-150,000, the current sales of investors who bought around $100,000 will stop. The famous CEO went a little further and said that when BTC reaches this level, investors who need liquidity will borrow money and invest in Bitcoin, which will push the price of Bitcoin even higher. *This is not investment advice.

I expect Ether to cross upward again, creating another touchpoint on the red resistance and breaking out above.</p><p>From the volume profile analysis and other methodologies from tradeCompass at ForexLive.com and investingLive.com, the next key price targets I anticipate are $2,882, and possibly - $2,920, and $2,967. Reaching the second target (around 2,920) implies another approximate 4% move, offering an attractive opportunity for day traders and short-term swing traders.</p><p>However, we might see a scenario where Ether revisits either the upper boundary of the purple channel or even retests the red line around 2,825.

This is not financial advice. </p><p>Importantly, if we observe two consecutive bearish daily candles, each clearly closing below the aforementioned resistance, this would challenge the current bullish bias and could hand control back to bears. Lastly, beware of fake-outs on lower timeframes.</p><p>Institutional Support and ETF Inflows:</p><p>Recent institutional data strongly underpins Ethereum’s bullish outlook. Notably, on June 10, Ethereum Spot ETFs witnessed a significant net inflow of $125 million, prominently driven by major asset managers:</p><ul><li><p>Blackrock: $80.60M</p></li><li><p>Fidelity: $26.30M</p></li><li><p>Bitwise: $8.40M</p></li><li><p>Grayscale: $9.70M</p></li></ul><p>This robust institutional participation highlights strategic accumulation and bullish sentiment among major players, indicating that smart money continues to favor Ethereum.</p><p>Volume Shift ETH vs. BTC:</p><p>A critical volume shift further cements ETH’s bullish momentum. Ethereum's trading volume increased dramatically by approximately $29.60 billion within a 24-hour timeframe, contrasting starkly with Bitcoin’s volume drop of $28.31 billion. This divergence demonstrates a clear investor shift, possibly indicating a rotation away from Bitcoin toward Ethereum, potentially driven by fundamental developments or favorable sentiment towards ETH’s utility and upcoming network improvements.</p><p>ETH Futures Market Data:</p><ul><li><p>Current ETH Futures Price: $2,806.5</p></li><li><p>Daily Range: $2,785.0 - $2,845.5</p></li><li><p>52-week Range: $1,387.0 - $4,142.5</p></li><li><p>Volume & Open Interest:</p><ul><li><p>Volume: 1.63K contracts (moderate liquidity)</p></li><li><p>Open Interest: 15.47K contracts (significant institutional presence)</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Performance indicators remain strong:</p><ul><li><p>Weekly (1W): +6.95%</p></li><li><p>Monthly (1M): +10.66%</p></li><li><p>Quarterly (3M): +46.84%</p></li></ul><p>These indicators highlight a robust short-term recovery and bullish momentum in Ethereum futures.</p><p>ETH Futures Forward Curve Analysis:</p><p>The futures forward curve projects steadily increasing Ethereum prices into mid-2026, aligning with heightened institutional interest and bullish long-term outlook.
