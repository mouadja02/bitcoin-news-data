2025-06-11T12:57:08,"US-China Trade Agreement Announced, CPI Data Released: Bitcoin’s Market Reaction","US President Donald Trump took it to his social media platform, Truth Social, to announce that the two leading economic countries have reached a trade deal agreement, which is now in the final stretch of being officially signed. The terms include a total of 55% tariffs for the US and 10% for China. Trump added that the relationship between the two is “excellent,” and Chinese students will continue using US colleges and universities, which have “always been good with me.” BREAKING: Initial details of the US-China trade deal include: 1. “Total of 55% tariffs” for US 2. 10% tariffs for China 3. Any “necessary rare earths” will be supplied by China 4. Rare earths to be supplied upfront by China 5. US to allow Chinese students to attend US… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 11, 2025 Despite the announcement, the term “total of 55% tariffs” for the US remains rather vague, and investors are still waiting for further details. The deal, reached only two days after talks began in London on Monday, is now only subject to approval by Chinese President Xi Jinping and the POTUS, who appears rather satisfied with the terms. In other, somewhat related news, the US CPI data for May went live, showing lower than expected numbers. The annual inflation rate is at 2.4% and a minor 0.1% increase for the month. According to CNBC, this suggests that the tariffs are not significantly impacting the US economy, as many had feared, at least for now. BTC’s price reacted almost immediately to the two developments and went from roughly $109,000 to nearly $110,000 within minutes. It has failed to continue upward and now sits around $400 away from the upper range boundary. BTCUSD.

2025-06-11T12:50:39,"Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Surge to $1M, Dismissing Fears of Crypto Winter","Bitcoin advocate and Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has once again voiced bold optimism about the future of the world’s largest cryptocurrency, declaring that the era of crypto market winters is over. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Saylor said Bitcoin is poised for significant growth, projecting it could reach $1 million in value as adoption rises and supply tightens. “Winter is not coming back,” Saylor stated confidently. “We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” Bitcoin Demand Outpaces Miner Supply Saylor explained a key market dynamic driving his bullish outlook: limited daily supply versus surging institutional demand. According to him, just 450 BTC—valued around $50 million at current prices—are introduced to the market each day by miners. As public companies and ETF providers increasingly accumulate these coins, Saylor believes upward pressure on prices is inevitable. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” he explained. His firm, Strategy, has been a major player in Bitcoin accumulation , having acquired 582,000 BTC since 2020, now worth over $63 billion. Saylor emphasized that the Bitcoin market has matured and stabilized, adding, “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” U.S. Support and Global Adoption Strengthen the Case Backing his bold prediction, Saylor pointed to growing political and institutional support for BTC in the U.S. He cited President Donald Trump’s favorable stance on crypto, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s endorsement, and signals from traditional banks moving toward offering Bitcoin custody services. He also acknowledged recent volatility, noting that Trump’s February tariffs triggered a steep decline in BTC price, but maintained that broader momentum remains strong. “Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period,” Saylor said. In addition to U.S. interest, Saylor referenced global developments, including Pakistan’s announcement of plans to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve . With countries and institutions joining the race to accumulate BTC, Saylor believes the next major phase of adoption has already begun. “If it’s not going to zero,” he reiterated, “it’s going to $1 million.” The post Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Surge to $1M, Dismissing Fears of Crypto Winter appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/michael-saylor-predicts-bitcoin-surge-to-1m-dismissing-fears-of-crypto-winter/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T12:45:35,"Ethereum's strongest run since US election leads this week's $286M crypto fund inflows","Crypto funds have attracted $286 million in weekly inflows according to CoinShares data. This extends the current streak to seven weeks with $11 billion total accumulation. Ethereum-led crypto funds saw $296.4 million in weekly inflows. It has experienced seven consecutive weeks of bullish investor sentiment. ETH-linked funds’ recent run has now extended its current inflow streak to $1.5 billion in total inflows over the same period. The week’s haul places Ethereum at 10.5% of assets under management in digital investment products. This concentration is a reflection of Ethereum’s rebound from earlier phases of diminished institutional confidence as well as regulatory uncertainty. CoinShares data marks this as Ethereum’s strongest inflow on record since the US election in November. The seven-week trend indicates sustained institutional conviction over short-term speculation as the driving force behind the deployment boost. Cash flow into crypto funds. Source: CoinShares Bitcoin faces second week of outflows amid policy uncertainty Bitcoin experienced its second consecutive week of outflows with $56.5 million, overshadowed by Ethereum’s performance in the same period. Monthly outflows for the month totaled $57 million. Policy uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve actions kept institutional investors on the sidelines and propelled Bitcoin’s adverse flow trend. Short-bitcoin products also experienced their second week in a row of outflows that reflected reduced bearish positioning by institutional investors. Although there have been net outflows in recent periods, Bitcoin still has significant assets under management at $151.2 billion of investment products. Year-to-date flows are positive at $10.1 billion. Bitcoin’s recent behavior differs from the seven-week cumulative influx trend that governs the entire cryptocurrency universe. The deviation means that investors are rotating and choosing among cryptos, but not necessarily leaving digital assets. Regional distribution shows US leadership in crypto funds The United States led global inflows with $175 million and accounted for the majority of weekly digital asset investment activity. Germany followed with $47.8 million in inflows, while Switzerland contributed $15.7 million to the positive trend. Canada and Australia rounded out the major contributors with $9.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Minor outflows were reported in Brazil at $9.2 million and Hong Kong at $14.6 million, with the latter ending a period of record inflows in the region. Altcoin activity remained subdued compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum movements. Sui had tiny inflows of $1.1 million, and XRP endured its ongoing downtrend with outflows of $6.6 million. This is the third consecutive week that investors have been taking money out of the crypto. Multi-asset products experienced $6.58 million of outflows for the week and $142.12 million year-to-date outflows. Solana experienced minimal outflows of $2.09 million, and Cardano experienced minimal outflows of $0.4 million. High activity concentration in Bitcoin and Ethereum contrasts with low altcoin movement. This suggests institutional investors want to maintain concentration on established digital assets and avoid diversifying into general crypto exposure under prevailing market conditions.

2025-06-11T12:41:54,"U.S. Data Released: Bitcoin and Stocks Stay Steady!","The post U.S. Data Released: Bitcoin and Stocks Stay Steady! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has released the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May. The report shows inflation rising to 2.5% year-over-year, in line with forecasts. Despite this slight uptick, Bitcoin, stocks, and altcoins held their ground, showing no big moves. Let’s take a closer look at what this means for traders and the economy. CPI and Core CPI Numbers Confirmed The May Consumer Price Index (CPI) report revealed that inflation rose slightly compared to April, raising new concerns about the pace of economic cooling in the U.S. Meanwhile, the year-over-year (YoY) headline CPI increased to 2.5% in May, up from 2.3% in April. Similarly, Core CPI YoY, which excludes food and energy prices, ticked up to 2.9%, compared to 2.8% in the previous month. On a month-over-month (MoM) basis, the headline CPI held steady at 0.2%, while Core CPI MoM rose to 0.3%, up from 0.2% in April. These small changes might not seem like much, but they could have a big impact on where the markets go. What the Fed Will Do Next? With inflation staying moderate, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its June 12 meeting. According to the CME FedWatch Tool , the chance of a rate cut in July is now low, pushing expectations further into late 2025. Interestingly, prediction markets like Polymarket suggest there’s a 75% chance that the Fed might cut rates in 2025. Next Key Events To Watch out for? June 18 – FOMC Meeting: The Fed will decide on interest rates. Even if they hold rates steady, markets will listen closely to Fed Chair Powell’s words and the dot plot for clues about future cuts. Even if rates stay the same, Powell’s remarks will carry heavy weight. June 12 – U.S. PPI Report: Producer prices give early signals of future consumer inflation. A cooler print might boost optimism for rate cuts. June 17 — U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes On June 17, the US will release the Import and Export Price Indexes, which track international trade prices. In April, import prices rose slightly by 0.1%. Impact on the Crypto Market If the Federal Reserve stays cautious and maintains a hawkish stance, Bitcoin could face short-term pressure. Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $109,739, showing a slight increase over the last 24 hours. Interestingly, altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are also seeing a bullish surge, with all of them trading in the green today.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/u-s-data-released-bitcoin-and-stocks-stay-steady/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-11T12:15:36,"US Lawmakers Push Forward CLARITY Act to Define Crypto Rules for SEC and CFTC","The post US Lawmakers Push Forward CLARITY Act to Define Crypto Rules for SEC and CFTC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today, the House Committees of Financial Services and Agriculture passed the bipartisan CLARITY Act ( H.R. 3633 ), setting it for a full floor vote next. The financial committee advanced the measure with a 32-19 vote, agriculture committee passed it with a 47-6 vote. Key highlights of the CLARITY Act It aims to resolve the longstanding jurisdiction conflict among the crypto regulatory agencies of the US by redefining the responsibilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It establishes that certain crypto assets will be regulated as commodities under the CFTC, while others will remain securities and operate under the SEC. The CLARITY Act also offers limited liability protection for blockchain developers , excluding them from money transmitter regulations. It also established the disclosure, fund segregation, and conflict of interest rules to protect the investors from crypto fraud. Maintaining Decentralized Finance (DeFi), the act establishes consumer safeguards for non-custodial wallet providers and peer-to-peer crypto transactions . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Connecticut Passes Bill to Ban Bitcoin and Crypto Investments , Despite broad support CLARITY ACT faces criticism Representative Maxine Waters voiced concerns while warning that certain provisions in the bill can lead to a conflict of interest. Her comment indicated the ties between political leaders and the crypto industry. Brad Sherman stated that the bill could lead to industry bailouts and regulatory arbitrage. Former CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad called the CLARITY Act ‘complex ’ while stating that the bill has expanded confusion rather than resolving the issues of crypto regulatory ambiguity. CFTC will lead crypto regulations After becoming the primary crypto regulator, CFTC will oversee digital commodities, covering most cryptocurrencies and tokens traded on cash markets, including DeFi activities. It will mandate the activities of exchanges, brokers, and spot markets for non-security digital assets like Binance and Ethereum. It will also mandate stablecoin trade and custody on a commodity exchange, while the SEC’s role is limited to enforcing anti-fraud rules in stablecoin. What’s next? Debate and vote on the CLARITY Act After seeking approval from both committees, the CLARITY Act will proceed to the full House for votes and arguments. And if it is ultimately enacted, then it will become the first comprehensive law in the US for a crypto and digital assets regulatory framework. While the US Senate remains uncertain, the upper chamber works on enhancing digital asset law. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The CLARITY Act will clarify roles by defining “digital commodities” (under CFTC oversight, including most cryptocurrencies and DeFi spot markets) and “investment contract assets” (under SEC, focusing on how assets are sold). What are the main concerns critics have about the CLARITY Act’s provisions? Critics worry about potential conflicts of interest, regulatory arbitrage (creating minimal utility blockchains for CFTC oversight), reduced financial safeguards, and the bill’s complexity hindering effective regulation. What role will CFTC and SEC play if the CLARITY Act is enacted? The CFTC will become the primary regulator for digital commodities, overseeing exchanges and brokers. The SEC will retain authority over investment contract offerings and enforce anti-fraud rules, particularly for stablecoins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/us-lawmakers-push-forward-clarity-act-to-define-crypto-rules-for-sec-and-cftc/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB","News|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare

2025-06-11T12:12:06,"Peter Thiel-Backed Bullish Eyes IPO in ‘Confidential’ SEC Filing","The post Peter Thiel-Backed Bullish Eyes IPO in ‘Confidential’ SEC Filing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Peter Thiel-backed exchange aims to go public amid growing institutional interest and a friendlier U.S. crypto stance Bullish, the crypto exchange backed by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, has confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As investor confidence returns to the digital asset space, the timing couldn’t be more calculated, especially with President Donald Trump signaling strong support for the industry. Bullish Takes Another Shot at Going Public This isn’t Bullish’s first attempt to hit the public markets. The exchange tried to go public in 2021 through a SPAC merger, but that deal fell apart due to rising interest rates and a tougher market environment. Now, under the leadership of CEO Tom Farley, the former NYSE Group president, Bullish is making a fresh move. Investment bank Jefferies is handling the underwriting, but the company is keeping further details under wraps for now. The market conditions, however, look far more favorable than they did a few years ago. Institutional-First Crypto Exchange Launched in 2021 with a $300 million capital injection from Thiel’s Founders Fund and other top investors, Bullish was built for institutional traders rather than retail users. That focus gives it an edge in today’s maturing crypto landscape. The exchange is regulated in Gibraltar and designed to offer high-performance trading infrastructure with deep liquidity – qualities that institutions are increasingly seeking as they return to digital assets. Crypto IPOs Steal the Spotlight Recent successes make way for Bullish’s ambitions. Circle, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, raised $1.1 billion in its debut last week, soaring 167% on day one. Gemini, founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed for a U.S. listing on June 6 , while eToro hit Nasdaq under the ticker ETOR on May 14. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Extended Crypto Cycle Ahead, Says Bitwise CIO as Bitcoin Hits $110K , A Cointelegraph report from April 3 highlights crypto’s edge: tokens on major exchanges delivered an 80% average return on investment (ROI) over 180 days, outpacing Nasdaq (51%) and NYSE (54%) listings. Thiel’s Vision Meets Trump’s Crypto Push Peter Thiel has always seen Bullish as a core part of the evolving crypto revolution. Back in 2021, it was valued at $9 billion, and its institutional-grade platform gives it a strong shot at standing out. Now, with Trump backing clearer digital asset regulation and even hinting at a national Bitcoin reserve, momentum is building. Institutions are starting to shift their strategy, and crypto-friendly U.S. policies are making the market more attractive. For Bullish, that means the stars may finally be aligning for a successful IPO. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to DeFiLlama data on June 10, 2025, the total value locked on the Sui now sits at $1.96 billion. This marks an approximate 10% increase from the $1.77 range it maintained over the past week, bringing the protocol closer to regaining the $2 billion milestone achieved earlier this year.

As recently announced, Nasdaq has filed a 19b-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list the 21Shares SUI ETF. Nasdaq just filed to list the 21Shares SUI ETF — a spot ETF backed by the SUI token. From $300M+ in global ETP inflows to a potential U.S. listing, institutional momentum for Sui is very real. Next stop: institutional adoption. pic.twitter.com/5AGtmXimHs — Sui (@SuiNetwork) June 10, 2025 This filing follows 21Shares’ S-1 registration in April, formally initiating the regulatory review process for a spot ETF based on the SUI token. Market analysts have also placed odds for a SUI ETF approval in 2025 at 60%, fueling the positive sentiment. Kevin Boon, the president of Sui’s founding team Mysten Labs, praised the development stating, “Looking back at our mainnet only two years ago, the milestone of a NASDAQ filing is a powerful moment. We are proud to help 21Shares build towards a world where every investor can access SUI.” Beyond the ETF speculation, multiple ecosystem-wide developments are also contributing to Sui’s rising TVL. For one, the network has seen an increase in Bitcoin-pegged assets, with around 10% of its locked value now held in tokens such as wBTC, LBTC, and stBTC. Additionally, Sui recently crossed a major liquidity threshold, with over $1 billion in stablecoins now circulating across its DeFi applications. Meanwhile, the native token of the protocol SUI ( SUI ) has been on a modest climb all week. At press time, it trades around $3.47, reflecting a 2% gain over the past 24 hours and approximately 7% over the last week.

2025-06-11T12:07:44,"Connecticut bans state use and investment in crypto under sweeping new law","Connecticut has enacted a sweeping ban on state-level use, investment, or custody of virtual currencies, blocking any potential creation of a public Bitcoin reserve. On June 10, Connecticut has enacte d HB 7082, a sweeping overhaul of the state’s money transmission laws that includes a strict prohibition on the use of virtual currencies by state entities. The new law, signed as Public Act 25-66 and effective October 1, bars the state and its political subdivisions from accepting payments in virtual currency or from purchasing, holding, investing in, or establishing a reserve of such currencies. The statute defines “virtual currency” as provided in section 36a-596 of Connecticut’s general statutes, a definition broad enough to cover most cryptocurrencies in use today. The bill passed unanimously through both chambers of the state legislature, signaling broad bipartisan consensus against state-sponsored virtual currency initiatives, including any form of a sovereign bitcoin reserve. Source: @Bitcoin _Laws You might also like: Texas approves Bitcoin reserve bill, awaits governor’s signature In addition to the ban, HB 7082 imposes tighter regulations on private-sector money transmitters involved with virtual currencies. It requires businesses that deal in digital wallets or crypto kiosks to be licensed and to comply with strict financial safeguards, including 1:1 reserve backing for virtual currencies held on behalf of customers, detailed consumer risk disclosures, fraud protections, transaction limits, and receipt requirements. Connecticut’s move stands in stark contrast to the growing momentum in many other U.S. states, where legislatures are actively advancing bills to establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserves.

Many individuals in this period are looking for the one coin that will bring them a multiple return on their investment. Every week, there’s a new project, a new listing, or a fresh trend making noise across the space. After the quick dip experienced when Bitcoin fell to the $100,000 area, the market quickly recovered and now the market is buzzing again with new tokens getting attention, and communities forming around promising ideas. Skate is another project which is gaining a lot of attention lately. Bitunix exchange has officially listed Skate Coin (SKATE) on its spot and futures market, a project that’s starting to catch the eyes of both developer and investor circles. What is Skate Chain’s Coin (SKATE)? Skate is a new project that’s changing the way different virtual machines (VMs) work together. It’s a protocol that lets users and apps interact smoothly across different VMs without the hassle of switching wallets or using complicated bridges. At the heart of this system is the SKATE token, which helps secure the network, lets holders vote on important decisions, and rewards people who help grow the ecosystem. The maximum supply is 1 billion SKATE tokens, with 150 million in circulation already. As per Coinmarketcap Skate Coin price at the time of writing is $0.054. Skate works through three main parts: the Hub Chain, Skate AVS which keeps everything secure using advanced technology, and the Executor Network which manages tasks between chains. This setup makes it possible for apps to run smoothly across many blockchains at once. What makes Skate really stand out is how it solves a big problem in crypto: fragmentation.

2025-06-11T12:00:57,"Dogecoin Faces Make-Or-Break Moment This Month, Predicts Analyst","Dogecoin is changing hands near $0.198 on Wednesday afternoon in Europe, almost 20 % below its late-March high yet still clinging to an eleven-month up-trend that now converges with a formidable technical inflection, according to independent analyst “VisionPulsed.” Is This Dogecoin’s Summer Liftoff? Speaking in a 10 June video, the analyst told viewers he had been “making the case that the first two weeks of June should be when we start moving up—if we’re bullish. He conceded that “there is a chance the move has started” after Dogecoin closed a two-day candle back above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement drawn from the December 2024 swing high. The backdrop VisionPulsed describes is notably risk-on. Bitcoin is hovering around $109,500, roughly 3% shy of its all-time high, while Ethereum has punched out a fresh twelve-month high above $2,790. In equities, the S&P Small-Cap 600—an index the analyst referenced when he quipped that “the S&P broke 600 yesterday”—posted its strongest five-day advance since March, a move the analyst interprets as validation of a global-liquidity gauge Global M2. Related Reading: Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets Hash-ribbon signals on Bitcoin flipped positive two weeks ago, the analyst noted, historically an early marker of revived demand for risk assets. “Bitcoin at 110K says we should go up. Ethereum breaking out says we should go up. If we still don’t go up… just pick a different investment choice.” Central to VisionPulsed’s thesis is a 70-day cyclical window counted from Dogecoin’s April 1 local low. “We’re approaching that 70-day mark.… It is now the time for it to be bullish,” he said, warning that failure to rally before mid-June would all but invalidate the setup. Yet the analyst concedes that Dogecoin’s fate is tethered to the ETH/BTC pair and to Bitcoin dominance, which has remained stubbornly elevated: “When the ETH-BTC move does occur, that’s going to be when the dominance falls and we need the dominance to fall because that’s when Dogecoin goes to the moon.” Until that rotation happens, any up-ticks in DOGE may remain prone to stalling beneath long-term resistance. Related Reading: Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive VisionPulsed identifies three price milestones that will decide sentiment. A daily close above $0.23 would constitute the first clear break of the descending trend-line in place since December, while $0.30—the 0.618 retracement of the entire 2021–2024 bear market—marks the level at which, he says, “people will start talking about Dogecoin at your summer camp… it’s going to be euphoric.” Should time drag on, he allows that the trigger could slide to $0.27, but the message is stark: “If we just shoot up, it’s still $0.30. If we take longer, it could be lower, but it’s the same concept.” With Bitcoin firm above six figures, Ethereum printing new local highs, and global liquidity gauges flashing green, the stage is set for an upside resolution. Whether Dogecoin can convert that macro tail-wind into a decisive break above $0.23—and ignite the $0.30 euphoria line—will become evident within the next fortnight. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.197.

2025-06-11T11:50:29,"Russia’s Moscow Exchange debuts trading on Bitcoin index","The largest Russian stock market, Moscow Exchange, is now calculating its own Bitcoin index, reflecting the price of the leading cryptocurrency on major coin trading platforms. The move, which comes shortly after the exchange started trading Bitcoin futures, is seen as another step towards integrating decentralized digital assets into Russia’s conservative financial system. Moscow Exchange introduces its own Bitcoin index The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) has for the first time published the value of its new cryptocurrency index, Moscow Exchange PFI Bitcoin Index (MOEXBTC). On Tuesday, the day it was launched, the indicator grew by 3.1%, slightly exceeding $109,169. On Wednesday, it reached $109,439 and change, marking a 0.25% increase. The Bitcoin index is calculated once daily, at 12:30 p.m. Moscow time, the stock trading venue explained in a press release while also providing a detailed description on its website of the exact methodology employed. MOEXBTC is based on price data of perpetual futures and swaps for the BTC/USDT pair. MOEX said it’s collecting the numbers from four of the largest crypto exchanges in terms of daily volume – Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. These have been weighted as follows: Binance at 50%; Bybit 20%; OKX 15%; Bitget 15%, according to the index’s dedicated page . Noting that the coefficients are based on trading volumes and will be revised quarterly, MOEX said: “The index will be calculated as a weighted average of prices taking into account the weighting coefficients of the selected trading platforms.” Moscow Exchange launches its Bitcoin index after the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) officially confirmed last month that Russian financial institutions can legally offer qualified investors derivatives and other financial instruments linked to the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Following Bank of Russia’s approval at the end of May, MOEX started trading futures contracts for the shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). The Bitcoin futures volume reached $5 million during the first day of trading on June 4. Sberbank and Finam also announced crypto-related products. Russia takes the road to cryptocurrency integration While all the new crypto instruments have been made available exclusively to “ highly qualified ” investors, their offering has been viewed as a move towards integrating crypto assets in Russia’s traditional finances. Elena Baklanova, senior analyst at the financial analytics firm Euler, commented for the Russian business news portal RBC: “Since various instruments with an underlying asset in the form of cryptocurrency began to appear on the market, the launch of the [Bitcoin] index on the Moscow Exchange was a logical step.” According to Roman Nekrasov, co-founder of the blockchain solutions provider ENCRY Foundation, the creation of a Russian Bitcoin index, largely a symbolic move at this point, is part of a broader strategy to integrate crypto assets into the established financial system. “Like the launch of futures on IBIT, MOEXBTC is an attempt to integrate crypto into the framework that is already familiar to the regulator, without physical delivery, without trading in the asset itself,” the analyst told the crypto news outlet Forklog, elaborating: “This is a conservative, regulated experiment that allows us to test participants’ interest without going beyond the current legislation.” “The key question remains whether a sufficient number of secondary instruments will be created for the index to work as a full-fledged basis. Without this, it will remain an indicator ‘for show’,” Nekrasov emphasized. Russia, which has been tempted to use cryptocurrencies to circumvent sanctions, has yet to adopt comprehensive rules for digital assets such as Bitcoin. The CBR, which still stands in the way of allowing their free circulation in the Russian economy, proposed earlier this year to introduce an “experimental legal regime” that would facilitate crypto transactions under close regulatory oversight.

2025-06-11T11:45:18,"GameStop Shares Dip After-Hours Despite Bitcoin Investment","GameStop Corp (GME) shares slipped over 3.5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday following the release of its first-quarter earnings report, which showed mixed results. While the company posted improved profitability and narrowed operational losses, its revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations, highlighting ongoing challenges in the retail gaming sector. For the quarter ending May 3, GameStop reported revenue of $732.4 million, missing analysts’ forecast of $754.2 million and marking a 17% year-over-year decline from $881.8 million. The company’s financial update attributed the shortfall to weakening demand for physical video games—an industry trend that has been chipping away at GameStop’s core business for years. However, the company reported a net income of $44.8 million, a sharp turnaround from a net loss of $32.3 million in the same period last year. Operating losses also improved significantly, shrinking to $10.8 million from $50.6 million in Q1 2024. Bitcoin Enters the Balance Sheet The earnings report was also GameStop’s first since it revealed its entry into the world of Bitcoin. On May 28, the company disclosed that it had purchased 4,710 BTC—worth around $513 million at the time—making it one of the latest public firms to add Bitcoin to its treasury reserves. The Bitcoin purchase was financed through a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering , indicating GameStop’s commitment to diversifying its financial strategy beyond traditional investments. While the company has not announced a specific target for future Bitcoin holdings, it has stated it may increase or liquidate its holdings depending on market conditions. GameStop’s cash position stands strong, with $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities—up significantly from just $1 billion a year ago. This financial cushion gives the company room to explore further Bitcoin acquisitions if it chooses to pursue that route. GameStop Stock Performance Still Under Pressure Despite its improved bottom line and foray into digital assets, GameStop’s stock has remained relatively stagnant. GME is down approximately 3.8% year-to-date and continues to trade well below its historic January 2021 high of over $80, which occurred during the Reddit-fueled WallStreetBets surge. With a solid cash reserve and a bold step into Bitcoin , GameStop appears to be betting on a broader transformation. But whether this shift will be enough to revitalize investor confidence in a declining retail gaming market remains to be seen.

2025-06-11T11:25:42,"Will Bitcoin Hit $1 Million or Crash to Zero as Saylor Predicts?","MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has claimed that Bitcoin will reach the $1 million mark, dismissing fears that a new crypto winter may be coming. Saylor insists that “all evidence” points to incredible growth for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. “Winter is not coming back again,” Saylor stated during an interview with Bloomberg on June 10. “We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin doesn’t drop to zero, it will reach $1 million.” Billion-dollar asset manager ARK Invest in April raised its bullish Bitcoin price forecast from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. According to Saylor, approximately 450 Bitcoin are available for sale every day from miners, which equates to about $50 million at the current price. “If that $50 million is being absorbed, the price should go up,” he explained. He added that a growing number of public companies buying Bitcoin are acquiring “the entirety of the current supply.” MicroStrategy has accumulated 582,000 Bitcoin since it began buying in 2020, which is roughly $63.85 billion according to data from Saylor Tracker. “At current price levels, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the cryptocurrency economy one turn,” he said. However, Saylor acknowledged that if Bitcoin rises to $500,000 or $1 million, a correction of roughly $200,000 should be expected. Saylor pointed to ample evidence in the economy supporting his all-or-nothing prediction. He emphasized the support for Bitcoin from U.S. President Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. Traditional banks are also gearing up to provide Bitcoin storage services. “Bitcoin has passed its riskiest period; the accounting is fixed,” Saylor said. While Trump publicly supports Bitcoin, his trade war in February was a key catalyst for Bitcoin’s 40% fall from its January high of $109,000. Saylor also noted that BlackRock and other Bitcoin ETF providers are buying up the leading cryptocurrency on a daily basis. In addition, nation-states are also “joining the market.” This vision of Bitcoin’s binary future — either zero or a million — has played out in dramatic ways for early adopters. The story of Laszlo Hanyecz, the programmer who made the world’s first real-world Bitcoin transaction, is a legendary example. In May 2010, Hanyecz famously spent 10,000 Bitcoin to buy two pizzas — an amount worth just $41 at the time, but now valued at over $700 million at Bitcoin’s all-time high. Hanyecz, who also pioneered GPU mining and contributed to Bitcoin’s early software, is estimated to have spent or given away up to 80,000 Bitcoin in 2010 alone. If he had held onto those coins, his net worth could have exceeded $8 billion today. Yet, Hanyecz has said he has no regrets. For him, the value was in proving Bitcoin’s real-world utility and helping the network grow. His story serves as a reminder that Bitcoin’s journey has always been about bold bets and long-term conviction—qualities that Saylor now champions on a corporate scale. Saylor’s all-or-nothing outlook, combined with the lessons of pioneers like Hanyecz, underscores why so many in the crypto community see Bitcoin’s future as a high-stakes game: the rewards for conviction can be life-changing, but the risks are ever-present.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9527/will-bitcoin-hit-1-million-or-crash-to-zero-as-saylor-predicts,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-11T11:20:19,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Ether Outshines Bitcoin Ahead of CPI; Traders Eye ‘Altcoin ETF Summer’","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) briefly rose past $110,000 after headlines out of London pointed to progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations. It's now dropped back to remain little changed over 24 hours while the CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index rose 2%, suggesting a rotation into altcoins. One factor keeping bitcoin at bay and the preference for altcoins might be that the agreement out of London remains tentative, still needing sign-off from both Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. In traditional markets, the reaction was also mixed. Asian equities rose, with the Hang Seng index adding 0.8%, European stock indexes gained less than 0.2% and U.S. index futures pointed down. “There’ve been several twists and turns already, and markets are getting fairly used to this uncertainty by now,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said . Meantime, investors are preparing for a fresh batch of inflation data. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report due later today is expected to show a 0.3% increase in core inflation for May, with annual core inflation rising to 2.9%. Producer price data, which will follow tomorrow, is also forecast to climb. Among altcoins, ether (ETH) is showing quieter but potentially more meaningful strength. Options markets suggest traders are positioning for upside, with front-end volatility spiking and call options gaining favor, according to analysts at hedge fund QCP Capital . Add to that the $450 million in ether ETF inflows logged so far this month, and there's a suggestion of growing investor appetite. The shift is underpinned by the Ethereum blockchain’s expanding role as infrastructure for tokenized real-world assets. “Looking ahead, macro tailwinds are aligning for ETH,"" the QCP Capital analysts wrote. ""With the GENIUS Act advancing in the U.S. Senate, Circle’s IPO discussions resurfacing, and stablecoins gaining regulatory traction, Ethereum’s native role in tokenization and settlement rails may be primed for outsized structural upside.” Nevertheless, the CPI report is likely to dominate the conversation. A hotter-than-expected reading could reinforce concerns that inflation may remain sticky into the coming months, reducing the chance of a Fed interest-rate cut and potentially prompting a renewed run for hedges like gold. If the data comes in cooler, it could open the door for risk assets, including crypto, to extend their gains. Stay alert!

ETH trading also dominated derivatives markets: Coinglass data shows that more than $111 billion worth of ETH contracts changed hands over the past 24 hours, while BTC's contract trading volume just topping $87.5 billion. Ether also experienced $131 million worth of liquidations, more than double bitcoin's total. ETH is currently trading at $2,760, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours while bitcoin is little changed. Derivatives Positioning BTC options open interest (OI) hit $36.0B on Deribit, another June high. The $140K strike remains the most active, with $1.8B notional, and the 27 June expiry continues to hold the bulk of positioning at $13.9B. Calls make up 63% of OI, with the put/call ratio at 0.58 according to Deribit. ETH options OI rose to $6.6B, with the $3K strike holding $521M notional. The 27 June expiry leads with $2.4B, and calls account for 70% of open interest. The put/call ratio sits at 0.43 based on Deribit data, a more bullish skew than BTC. Futures OI across Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit and Hyperliquid climbed to $57.5B, marking the highest level since late January, according to Velo data. Binance leads with $24.3B. Funding rate APR remains broadly positive, with BTC at 9.8% on Binance and ETH at 10.95% on average across major exchanges.

The price is still trading in the daily orderblock of supply, which has capped the price since May. A healthy pullback could see price revisit the daily fair value gap around $2,650 — an area that bulls will likely eye for a potential higher low, especially with the U.S. CPI data on deck later today.

2025-06-11T11:20:15,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – June 11, 2025","The crypto market has seen another rise today, with nearly all top 100 coins recording a price increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 1% to $3.58 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $138 billion, the highest we’ve seen in several days. TLDR: The market records another increase, sentiment turns bullish; BTC is moving towards testing a new all-time high; ETH is among the day’s best performers, may see additional gains; Crypto and TradFi are focused on the US-China trade agreement and the US inflation report; US spot BTC ETFs record $431 million in inflows, spot ETH ETFs continue 17 days of inflows; Sygnum warns that Strategy’s holdings are “approaching a point where they become problematic”; The rally seems sustainable, but the investors stay focused on the heated macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Crypto Winners & Losers Like yesterday, all top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices increase over the past 24 hours. The world’s top coin, Bitcoin (BTC) has risen by just 0.3%, meaning it’s unchanged in this timeframe, now trading at $109,531. This is also the smallest increase in this category. Ethereum (ETH) has recorded another notable rise. It’s up 4.6% to the price of $2,798. The category’s highest gainer is Dogecoin (DOGE) , which is now up 5.4%, changing hands at $0.2013. Moreover, looking at the top 100 coins, we find that only seven are down. Bittensor (TAO) fell the most among these: 3.1% to $421. Uniswap (UNI) noted the highest increase today, as it appreciated 18.1% to $8.41. Six other coins recorded double-digit increases. Investors, both crypto and TradFi, were focused on the US-China discussions in London for the past two days, where participants addressed tariffs and restrictions on shipments of key products, such as rare earth minerals and chips. On Tuesday, the parties said they agreed on “a framework” on both issues, though the specifics remain unclear. Moreover, Wednesday morning in the US will see the consumer price index for May, which will indicate how tariffs are affecting inflation. BREAKING: Citing trade wars, the World Bank sharply downgrades the global economic growth forecast for this year. https://t.co/PNmaVrcAMf — The Associated Press (@AP) June 10, 2025 Meanwhile, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at the onchain options AI-powered platform, Derive.xyz , argued that prices surged after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced exemptions for DeFi projects. ETH is “the big winner as it paves the way for rapid expansion.” Sebastian Pfieffer, managing director of Impossible Cloud Network , noted that Ethereum works to comply with European laws, but that “now it’s Europe’s turn to embrace decentralization, rather than putting unnecessary roadblocks in place.” This way, “Europe can be free of US political control over its cloud infrastructure,” he says. All Eyes on US Inflation Report Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler , said that there is a strong possibility for BTC to hit a new ATH soon. The price currently stands just a few percentage points below its previous peak. “Broadly speaking, financial markets remain optimistic,” he says. “However, the risk of a reversal remains, particularly if upcoming economic data disappoints. All eyes are now on [today’s] US inflation report. While markets are pricing in a moderate uptick, a higher-than-expected reading could trigger increased volatility across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.” Derive.xyz’s Sean Dawson commented that, despite the recent uptick in price, BTC implied volatility still hovers around its lowest levels this year. He explains that this could indicate “significant mispricing, offering traders opportunities to access cheap upside leverage or downside protection.” BTC 7-day (red) and 30-day (cyan) implied volatility. Source: Derive.xyz Dawson says that the muted response of implied BTC volatility despite the price rise suggests “a potential disconnect between market pricing and underlying risk. This presents a strategic window for traders to capitalize on relatively low-cost options, enabling efficient positioning for either further upside or potential downside in BTC.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $109,531, still nearing the all-time high of $111,814, which it hit on 22 May. The coin tested the $110,200 yet again today, reaching the intraday high of $110,237, but failed to maintain it. That said, should it break the ATH again, it will proceed to test the key resistance levels of $115,103 and $118,358. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView In the same period, Ethereum hit an intraday high of $2,821, seeing a minor pullback since, but gradually climbing on a daily basis. The coin broke the resistance level of $2,720, suggesting additional increases to follow. Sean Dawson commented that ETH volatility has jumped nearly 5% to 70% for 7-day volatility. It’s also holding at 66% for 30-day volatility. This means that daily ETH price moves “could be approximately twice as large as BTC’s,” he argued. ETH 7-day (red) and 30-day (cyan) implied volatility Moreover, the crypto market sentiment keeps climbing after entering the greed zone yesterday. Crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 65 today , indicating increasingly bullish sentiment and investors continuing to buy in. Meanwhile, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net inflow of $431.12 million on Tuesday. BlackRock’s $336.74 million contributed the most to this amount. The total net inflow so far stands at $45.06 billion. At the same time, US ETH spot ETFs have recorded seventeen consecutive days of inflows, adding another $124.93 million. BlackRock leads this list again with $80.59 million on 10 June. Overall, Ethereum investment products have seen a cumulative total net inflow of $3.5 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is continually seeing a rising investor interest, with over 80 publicly traded companies now holding BTC. However, some have raised red flags. According to the latest report by the global digital asset bank Sygnum , “large concentrated holdings are a risk for any asset.” At this point, Strategy’s holdings are “approaching a point where they become problematic, with the company holding close 3% of the total Bitcoin ever issued, but a much higher share of the actual liquid supply.” The company aims to acquire 5% of the total issued BTC. This “raises concerns.” Firstly, these vehicles amassing too much of the supply undermine Bitcoin’s safe haven properties. Secondly, private corporations controlling a large portion of the existing supply would make BTC inappropriate for central banks to hold as a reserve asset, Sygnum warns. Finally, a plunge in the liquid supply will also deter large institutions. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? Both the crypto and stock markets have increased in the last day, though crypto’s increase is notably higher. For example, the S&P 500 has increased by 0.55%, the Nasdaq-100 is up 0.66%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.25%. Stocks are up for three days straight, and today, they’re expected to react to the agreement reached during the US-China trade talks. Is this rally sustainable? The positive market sentiment keeps powering the current two-day rally. Analysts see the market moving higher, but they do warn traders and investors to keep an eye on macroeconomic and geopolitical events.

2025-06-11T11:17:54,"Connecticut Passes Bill to Ban Bitcoin and Crypto Investments","The post Connecticut Passes Bill to Ban Bitcoin and Crypto Investments appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On Tuesday, the state of Connecticut passed a controversial bill banning Bitcoin, making it illegal for citizens to hold or invest in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The bill, officially titled HB7082: “An Act Concerning the Regulation of Virtual Currency and State Investments ,” marks a major shift in crypto policy. Key Highlights of the Connecticut Crypto Ban 1. Crypto Risk Disclosure Required Under HB7082, crypto businesses engaged in money transmission must disclose all associated risks to consumers. This provision aims to protect investors from potential losses in the volatile crypto market. 2. Parental Consent for Minors Apps handling cryptocurrencies must now verify parental approval for users under the age of 18, adding a layer of safety for younger users. 3. Protecting Public Funds The bill ensures that state-level crypto activity is closely regulated to protect government funds from being exposed to crypto market risks. Stricter Regulations on Crypto Businesses The bill enforces strict anti-money laundering (AML) policies. All crypto-related businesses must comply with regulations designed to prevent illicit financial activity, a move that Connecticut lawmakers say will make the digital asset space safer and more transparent. Falling Behind in the Bitcoin Reserve Race? While Connecticut is cracking down, other US states are racing to build Bitcoin reserves: New Hampshire Texas Arizona These states are exploring strategic Bitcoin reserves (SBRs) in line with Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, said: “Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value aligns with our state’s history of making smart, diversified investments in emerging assets.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Queen Senator Lummis Says Unfair Tax Laws Threaten Bitcoin , More US States Abandon Crypto Laws Connecticut isn’t alone in backing away from crypto. A growing number of US states have recently dropped or paused crypto-related legislation, including: Florida Wyoming South Dakota North Dakota Pennsylvania Montana Oklahoma The reason? Bitcoin’s price volatility and doubts over long-term stability. GENIUS Act and Stablecoin Regulation Ahead Despite state-level setbacks, the U.S. is preparing for federal-level crypto reform. The upcoming GENIUS Act and stablecoin legislation are set to be discussed by U.S. Senators on Wednesday, June 12. These efforts, led by Trump-aligned lawmakers, aim to create a unified national approach to stablecoins and digital asset oversight. Final Thoughts As Connecticut bans Bitcoin, the crypto landscape across the U.S. continues to shift. With federal laws like the GENIUS Act and states like Texas building reserves, the divide between crypto-friendly and crypto-cautious regions is growing. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Connecticut’s new law aims to protect state funds from crypto market volatility by banning government investment.

2025-06-11T11:10:14,"Here’s Why the Bitcoin Network Feels Like a Ghost Town Despite the $110K Recovery","Bitcoin climbed $110,000 on June 11, in a significant milestone that has reignited bullish sentiment across the crypto market. The latest surge has prompted market participants to predict that the leading cryptocurrency could be on track for a push toward new all-time highs in the coming weeks. However, the data tells a different story. On-Chain Apathy and Record-Low Spot Volume The Bitcoin network feels like a “ghost town,” according to the latest analysis from CryptoQuant, which highlighted a dramatic decline in on-chain and spot market activity. The on-chain analytics platform stated that Bitcoin’s Network Activity Index has plunged to just 3.47k, which is one of the lowest levels seen in the past 18 months. Retail demand has also taken a hit as on-chain transactions involving amounts under $10,000, which is often used to gauge retail participation, have dropped by more than 5%. Meanwhile, spot trading volume on centralized exchanges has fallen to a 4.5-year low, to levels last seen in October 2020. CryptoQuant further stated that real Bitcoin is barely moving, both on-chain and across exchanges, even as ETF demand remains relatively steady. Despite this slump in visible activity, a total of 847,200 BTC has transitioned to the long-term holder supply, suggesting that coins are being held rather than traded. These holdings have remained untouched for over 155 days, which echoes similar accumulation patterns seen in late 2024. Ethereum Futures Heat Up While Bitcoin’s spot and on-chain metrics remain muted, the derivatives market is telling a different story, especially for Ethereum. ETH open interest on futures platforms has soared to a record 7.17 million ETH, and retail trading frequency on futures has also spiked above its one-year average. This reflects a growing shift in investor attention from spot markets to futures, particularly visible among retail participants. While the surface-level data shows a stagnant and quiet Bitcoin network, deeper metrics reveal a market in wait mode, with long-term conviction among holders and rising speculative energy in derivatives markets. For now, Bitcoin may feel deserted , but CryptoQuant hints this could be the calm before a major move – a silent buildup before volatility returns.

2025-06-11T11:09:47,"Victims drag World Cup stars to court over crypto NFT scam","In Spain, a high-profile investigation has been opened following a cryptocurrency project endorsed by top football players that is accused of defrauding investors of more than $3.4 million. The probe centers on Shirtum Europa SLU, which disappeared soon after advertising inactive digital collectibles tied to player image rights. The six footballers named in the criminal complaint, which is now under consideration by the Fifth District Court of Barcelona, are World Cup winners and former Barcelona and Sevilla players. They include Alejandro Gomez, Lucas Ocampos, Ivan Rakitic, Javier Saviola, Nico Pareja and Alberto Moreno. They are also accused of deceiving the masses by officially supporting Shirtum, who had no viable platform. The case was filed by 12 alleged victims and reinforced by professional witnesses, which included a financial investigation by reputable economist Prosper Lamothe. Court filings allege that investors were enticed with the promise of exclusive NFTs and speculative profits, only to be stuck with tokens that ultimately failed to develop utility or value. NFTs sold, platform abandoned Shirtum sold its $SHI token as the sole way to buy NFTs linked to the personal brands of huge football stars. There were digital items that cost more than $500. However, since there was no support to trade or withdraw them from the marketplace, users could not. Court filings allege that the platform’s developers established a purposefully complex business model between Spain and Andorra. The purpose, investigators claim, was to avoid taxes and protect founders against liability. The key protagonists of the operation are Argentine businessman David Rozencwaig and Catalan businessmen Manel Angel Torras, Marc Alberto Torras, and Manuel Morillas. The appearance of the players as co-founders and the faces of the project on its publicity vaulted public confidence in the project. Papu Gomez reportedly played an essential role, using personal relations to bring on board other stars to popularize the platform. According to the complaint, after the downfall of Shirtum, the players deleted posts about their participation on social media. In 2022, Shirtum claimed that company funds had been drained following a cyberattack, although police reports were never made. Investigators have since become suspicious that the said funds could have been diverted to personal use. Omegapro tied to global football endorsements Shirtum is not the first crypto-related program to feature football stars. A separate investigation published by El Diario shows that at least 20 current and former professional players are being sued due to their promotional involvement in Omegapro, an alleged worldwide Ponzi scheme that raised at least 3 billion euros in investor funds. Omegapro promised 300% returns in 14 months on crypto investments and ran massive campaigns with sports celebrities such as Ronaldinho, Kaka, Luis Figo, Iker Casillas, Carles Puyol, Roberto Carlos, and Vinicius Jr. Victim legal teams claim that celebrity endorsements were a critical factor in gaining trust and victimizing people around the world. Several football players are currently under scrutiny over possible deception of the masses through their linkage with unlicensed financial activities. Crypto fraud landscape expands with celebrity and AI tactics The Shirtum and Omegapro situation is aligned with a bigger trend of fraudulent crypto schemes using famous celebrities to lure investors. Analysts warn that sports influencers and celebrities, especially ones with massive followings among fans, are still exploited or eager accomplices in plans to remove the distinction between promotion and participation. According to a recent study by crypto exchange Bitget, advanced scams are becoming hard to detect. According to the research released in June 2025, scammers stole over $4.6 billion in 2024. That is a 24% rise from the previous year, and nearly 40% of incidents involved AI-created deepfakes. The report points to an increasing number of fraudsters using synthetic media to impersonate executives, generate documents, and construct fake identities. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen noted that these scams are tough to spot due to the convergence of emotional manipulation and advanced visual trickery. She noted that currently, most platforms have a gamified interface, synthesized audit certificate, and social referral mechanisms to achieve viral growth. “Scams today aren’t amateur operations,” said Chen.

A group of eight deputies of Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, submitted a bill which would authorize the country's National Bank to include ""virtual assets in the gold and foreign exchange reserves,"" on Tuesday. The bill's principal sponsor is Yaroslav Zheleznyak, who serves as first deputy chairman of the Committee on Finance, Tax and Customs Policy. Zheleznyak described the bill as a ""step [to] integrate Ukraine into global financial innovations,"" in a post on Telegram. ""Proper management of crypto reserves will help strengthen macroeconomic stability and create new opportunities for the development of the digital economy,"" he added.

2025-06-11T11:02:44,"XRP Designed to Succeed Bitcoin? David Schwartz Unearthed Statement Drops a Bombshell","In a recent X post, XRP advocates Edo Farina dropped what he calls a “bombshell” revelation: a screenshot dated September 17, 2011, featuring David Schwartz, CTO and Chief Cryptographer of Ripple , saying: “I’ve been working on a Bitcoin successor myself, after seeing what has worked well and what has not worked well.” According to Farina, this statement hints at a key truth: XRP was intentionally crafted to succeed Bitcoin. Drawing from archived comments, historical patent records, and previous reporting, Farina posits that XRP is not merely an alternative to Bitcoin, but its direct and improved heir . “Bitcoin Successor” Straight from the Source Edo Farina, a prominent XRP community figure, resurfaced a nearly decade‑old statement attributed to Schwartz, suggesting that XRP was conceived as a Bitcoin successor, designed to address Bitcoin’s early limitations . While Litecoin, Dogecoin, and countless other tokens sprouted over time, Schwartz’s own words stand out, signaling intent far deeper than mere opportunism. Beyond the screenshot, the dots could be connected to Schwartz’s 1988 patent—a precursor to decentralized ledger architecture. Schwartz’s filing describes a distributed computing system that resembles modern blockchain validation processes. Farina suggests this foresight, coupled with Schwartz’s later work on Bitcoin and the XRP Ledger, reinforces the idea of XRP as an evolved form of the original. From Bitcoin to XRP: A Technical and Ideological Evolution Schwartz’s journey began in early 2011 when he and fellow developers Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto examined Bitcoin’s promise, but were increasingly concerned by its flaws: high energy consumption, slow transaction times, and limited scalability. At that time, Schwartz reportedly noted he was “looking for something new”, and by May 2011, development on XRP was underway. The official launch came in June 2012 . This clear progression, from Bitcoin interest to disillusionment with mining inefficiencies to the creation of XRP, exemplifies a conscious, iterative upgrade. Schwartz and his co-creators sought a protocol with near-instant settlement, minimal fees, and no reliance on energy-intensive mining. XRP as “Bitcoin 2.0” Farina and other XRP proponents view XRP as “Bitcoin 2.0”—the practical, enterprise-ready successor. In a report by TimesTabloid , this thesis is reinforced: XRP was explicitly built to “address Bitcoin’s inefficiencies,” boasting rapid transfers and low costs, rendering it well-suited for global financial adoption. The decentralized yet efficient consensus mechanism of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) operates using validator nodes, enabling transactions every few seconds, unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work congestion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Revelations, Patent Footprints, and Ripple’s Military Meta In the 2000s, Schwartz reportedly worked with the NSA on cryptographic infrastructure. This background, paired with XRPL’s focus on secure payments, leads Farina to question whether XRP was part of a larger, strategic initiative. Bitcoin Founder Speculation – Some XRP community members have speculated that Schwartz might even be—or among—the real Satoshi Nakamoto, noting XRP development began within weeks of Satoshi’s final public communications. Counterpoints: Supply, Decentralization & Bitcoin Maximalism To critics, XRP’s larger supply and different consensus methods undermine its “successor” claim. Schwartz frequently addresses such critiques, emphasizing that unit‑price comparisons are misleading without context; the real metric should be utility and market capitalization. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maximalists have publicly challenged XRP’s decentralization, prompting Schwartz to underscore the XRP Ledger’s governance model and validator diversity. A New Chapter in Crypto Legacy The narrative that XRP is the “real Bitcoin successor” rests on a compelling mix of direct quotes, early patents, developer timelines, and community speculation. Edo Farina’s curation of these elements has sharpened the debate, positioning XRP not as just another altcoin but as a purposeful response to Bitcoin’s shortcomings. Whether one interprets Schwartz’s work as strategic competition, technical evolution, or part of an obscured crypto legacy, XRP’s story is undeniably intertwined with Bitcoin’s foundational ethos. As digital assets evolve, this link validates XRP’s future beyond volatility, rooted in intent, design, and ambition.

2025-06-11T11:00:06,"Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin’s 2021 Cycle? Here’s The Target","With the recent Ethereum price trend, a crypto analyst has pointed out that the altcoin could be looking to stage a similar rally to what was seen with Bitcoin back in 2021. Crypto analyst TradingShot pointed out the similarities in a recent analysis and showing where the price could go if it does play out the same way. Ethereum Looks Like Bitcoin Did In 2021 In the analysis posted on TradingView, crypto analyst TradingShot showed how this Ethereum cycle movement looked similar to Bitcoin’s 2021 cycle movement. The first of this was recovery from a major price crash that led to new cycle lows for the cryptocurrency, before staging a recovery that pushed it toward new highs. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Still Coming? Why Bitcoin Is To Blame Despite Making ATHs For Bitcoin, the crash happened when the COVID-19 lockdown was announced. Following this, the Bitcoin price had fallen more than 50% from above $9,000 to less than $4,000 in less than one month. However, after this, the Bitcoin price rebounded from the cycle lows, crossing the 1-week MA50, and then breaking the lower high trendline, and going on to reach new all-time highs. For Ethereum, the crypto analyst pointed to the price crash triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff wars as being similar to Bitcoin’s COVID crash. After Donald Trump announced tariffs on other countries, the Ethereum price also crashed by a large margin, going from above $2,400 to below $1,500 in less than a month. This has been dubbed the ‘Trade War Crash’, and the altcoin is still reeling from the decline. Currently, the Ethereum price is stuck at the point where it is still trying to break above the 1-week MA50, which is now the major level to beat to confirm this trend. Just like Bitcoin, it has also seen the formation of major resistance at the lower highs, and this sits right at the $4,200 level. This means the Ethereum price still has around a 50% rally to complete before it confirms a similar trend to Bitcoin. How High ETH Price Could Go If It Plays Out If Ethereum does reclaim the 1W 50MA and then breaks the lower highs at $4,200, confirming this trend, then the resulting rally could be exceptional. For example, after breaking the lower highs, the Bitcoin price went on to reach new all-time highs of $69,000 in 2021. This means that the price went from below $4,000 to $69,000 in the space of a year. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric A similar rally would mean that the Ethereum price would rise above $10,000. Taking the same timelines into position, it would put ETH at this price sometime in 2026, a year from when the Trade Wars crash had occurred. A closer parabolic rally and an imitation of Bitcoin’s 1,700% rally would mean a price tag above $15,000 for the second-largest cryptocurrency in the space.

2025-06-11T11:00:03,"AI Regulation: Mastering Global Policy for Startup Success","BitcoinWorld AI Regulation: Mastering Global Policy for Startup Success Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping industries, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation and growth. For startups, leveraging AI can be the key to gaining a competitive edge, streamlining operations, and reaching new markets. However, this transformative power comes with significant challenges, particularly when navigating the complex landscape of AI regulation and policy across different jurisdictions. The journey from a local operation to successful global expansion requires a deep understanding of how AI technologies intersect with evolving legal frameworks. At a recent Bitcoin World Sessions event focused on AI, a breakout discussion brought together experts to delve into these critical issues. They explored how startups can not only survive but thrive amidst regulatory uncertainty, using AI-driven tools for enhanced digital trade , robust compliance, and efficient startup scaling . This article expands on those insights, providing a comprehensive guide for founders, investors, and policymakers grappling with the realities of the AI policy environment. What are the Key AI Policy Challenges for Startups? The rapid pace of AI development often outstrips the speed at which regulations can be drafted and implemented. This creates a dynamic and sometimes unpredictable environment for startups. Key challenges include: Lack of Harmonization: Different countries and regions are developing their own unique sets of AI rules, leading to a patchwork of requirements that can be difficult for a single startup to track and comply with across multiple markets. Defining AI: There is no universally agreed-upon legal definition of AI, which can create ambiguity about which technologies and applications fall under specific regulations. Data Privacy and Security: AI systems often rely on vast amounts of data. Complying with diverse global data protection laws (like GDPR, CCPA, etc.) while training and deploying AI models is a major hurdle. Bias and Fairness: Regulations are emerging to address potential biases in AI decision-making processes. Startups must implement measures to ensure their AI systems are fair and non-discriminatory, which requires careful data management and model validation. Liability: Determining who is responsible when an AI system causes harm or makes an error is a complex legal question that startups must consider, especially as regulations around AI liability evolve. Transparency and Explainability: Some regulations may require AI systems to be explainable or transparent in their decision-making, which can be challenging for complex ‘black box’ models. How Can Startups Leverage AI for Digital Trade and Global Expansion? Despite the policy challenges, AI offers powerful tools that can directly facilitate digital trade and enable smoother global expansion . Startups can strategically deploy AI in several areas: Automated Compliance Monitoring: AI-powered platforms can monitor changes in global regulations, alerting startups to new requirements related to data, privacy, specific AI uses (e.g., facial recognition, credit scoring), and trade restrictions. Optimizing Cross-Border Logistics and Supply Chains: AI can predict demand, optimize shipping routes, manage inventory across different regions, and navigate customs procedures more efficiently. Personalized Customer Experiences at Scale: AI enables tailored marketing, product recommendations, and customer support localized for different markets, improving conversion rates and customer satisfaction during startup scaling . Fraud Detection and Security: AI algorithms can analyze transaction patterns and user behavior to detect fraudulent activities and enhance security measures in cross-border transactions. Market Research and Localization: AI can analyze vast amounts of data from different markets to identify opportunities, understand local preferences, and assist with content localization and translation. Utilizing these AI capabilities allows startups to navigate the complexities of international markets more effectively, reducing manual effort and mitigating risks associated with digital trade . What Strategies Help Navigate AI Regulation and Ensure Compliance? Successfully managing AI regulation requires a proactive and strategic approach. Startups cannot afford to view compliance as an afterthought. Experts recommend several key strategies: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor regulatory developments in target markets. Subscribe to legal updates, follow relevant government agencies, and engage with industry associations. Build Compliance into Product Development: Design AI systems with privacy, fairness, and transparency in mind from the outset (Privacy by Design, Ethics by Design). This is far more efficient than trying to retrofit compliance later. Invest in Legal and Compliance Expertise: Even small startups should seek advice from legal professionals specializing in AI and data regulation, especially when planning global expansion . Implement Robust Data Governance: Establish clear policies for data collection, storage, use, and deletion. Ensure data used for training AI models is ethically sourced and compliant with relevant laws. Conduct Regular Audits and Risk Assessments: Periodically review AI systems for compliance with current regulations and assess potential risks related to bias, security, and privacy. Engage with Policymakers: Where possible, participate in consultations and provide feedback on proposed AI policy . Sharing real-world challenges and innovations can help shape more effective and balanced regulations. These steps are crucial for building trust with users and regulators, paving the way for sustainable startup scaling . Expert Insights from Bitcoin World Sessions: AI The discussion at Bitcoin World Sessions highlighted the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing. Speakers emphasized that while the regulatory landscape is fragmented, there are common principles emerging, particularly around data governance, transparency, and accountability. They noted that startups already dealing with the complexities of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency regulation may have a head start in understanding distributed compliance challenges. One key takeaway was the need for flexibility. Regulations will continue to evolve, and startups must build adaptable systems and processes. Another point raised was the potential for AI itself to help manage compliance, using natural language processing to analyze legal texts or machine learning to identify compliance gaps in internal processes. The experts also stressed the importance of focusing on ethical AI development, not just legal compliance. Building trustworthy AI systems fosters user adoption and can provide a competitive advantage in markets increasingly sensitive to how technology impacts society. Navigating AI policy is not just about avoiding penalties; it’s about building a responsible and sustainable business for long-term startup scaling . Conclusion: Mastering the AI Policy Maze for Global Success The intersection of AI, policy, and global business presents a formidable challenge for startups. However, by understanding the nuances of AI regulation , leveraging AI tools for efficient digital trade , adopting proactive compliance strategies, and staying informed about evolving AI policy , startups can successfully navigate this complex environment. The insights shared at events like Bitcoin World Sessions underscore that informed decision-making, ethical development, and strategic investment in compliance are paramount for achieving significant startup scaling and sustainable global expansion in the age of AI.

2025-06-11T10:57:43,"Ukraine Proposes Law to Hold Bitcoin in National Reserves","The post Ukraine Proposes Law to Hold Bitcoin in National Reserves appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ukraine is taking a bold step toward financial innovation. A new draft bill has been introduced in the Ukrainian Parliament that could allow the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in its national reserves. Ukrainian Lawmakers Push Pro-Crypto Legislation On June 10, 2025 , Ukrainian lawmakers submitted a draft law titled: “Draft Law on Amendments to the Law of Ukraine On the National Bank of Ukraine regarding the inclusion of virtual assets in the gold and foreign exchange reserves of Ukraine. This bill was proposed by several members of the Verkhovna Rada, including Yaroslav Zhelezniak , Oleksiy Zhmerenetskyi , Maksym Buzhanskyi , and others. Zhelezniak confirmed the development through his official Telegram channel, calling it a step forward in modernizing Ukraine’s financial infrastructure. What Does the Ukraine Crypto Bill Propose? The proposed legislation does not mandate the NBU to buy or hold crypto assets. Instead, it gives the central bank the legal option to include digital assets like Bitcoin in its gold and foreign exchange reserves. “How, when, and how much should be the decision of the regulator itself,” Zhelezniak clarified. Why This Move Matters for Ukraine With the ongoing war against Russia, Ukraine’s economy faces severe stress—GDP contraction, infrastructure damage, and dependence on foreign aid. The move to legalize crypto reserves could: Support macroeconomic stability Attract foreign investment Encourage digital innovation Help integrate Ukraine into the global economy Strategic Crypto Reserves: A Global Trend? Ukraine is not alone. Countries worldwide are exploring crypto reserves: In March 2025 , the United States launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 . Switzerland and Hong Kong have introduced crypto-friendly policies.

El Salvador , where economic instability led to historic adoption of Bitcoin. Final Thoughts If passed, Ukraine’s crypto bill could be a turning point—marking the country’s deeper alignment with global financial innovation . Allowing the central bank to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset could not only strengthen the economy but also position Ukraine as a crypto-forward nation in the post-war recovery phase. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

By allowing crypto reserves, Ukraine could enhance financial stability, attract foreign investment in its digital economy, and integrate more deeply into global financial innovation for recovery. What are the potential risks of Ukraine holding Bitcoin in its national reserves? Potential risks include Bitcoin’s price volatility impacting reserve valuation, cybersecurity threats for digital assets, and the need for significant legal and regulatory changes for proper management. Why do Ukrainian lawmakers see crypto as a tool for macroeconomic stability? Lawmakers believe crypto can offer access to global markets, bypass traditional banking restrictions, act as a hedge against inflation, and empower digital economic growth, bolstering stability during crises.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ukraine-proposes-law-to-hold-bitcoin-in-national-reserves/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T10:52:55,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-11: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, RIPPLE: XRP, INTERNET COMPUTER: ICP, ARBITRUM: ARB","The crypto market registered a marginal increase, rising nearly 1% as Bitcoin (BTC) stabilized around $109,000-$110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency dipped to a low of $108,436 late on Tuesday but recovered to reach $110,393 before moving to its current level of $109,562. BTC is marginally up over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continued to push higher, briefly crossing $2,800 before moving to its current level of $2,793, up nearly 4%. Ripple (XRP) registered a marginal drop, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 4%, having crossed $160, trading around $164. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 2%, and Cardano (ADA) is up nearly 2%, trading around $0.718. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. However, Toncoin (TON) is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $2.39. Markets Rise As US-China Trade Talks Continue US stocks continued rising for a second day as trade talks between the US and China continued in London. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.25%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.55%. The Nasdaq gained 0.63% and is now 285 points away from reclaiming the 20,000 level. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said negotiations between the US and China were going well, indicating a resolution may be close. Export controls remain a key point of discussion, with the US pressing Beijing to release rare earth materials while China is pushing for easing access to American semiconductors. However, Wall Street remains cautious, with investors waiting for a breakthrough in talks. Meanwhile, Chinese markets showed renewed volatility, registering a sudden dip in equities on Tuesday. Australia Uncovers Crypto Laundering Scheme Australian authorities have uncovered a crypto laundering scheme following an 18-month investigation into a 190 million Australian Dollar ($123 million) operation running via a cash-in-transit security company. The Australian Federal Police stated they had frozen $13.6 million worth of assets across Queensland and New South Wales. The investigation began in December 2023 and uncovered an operation using an armored vehicle unit of a security business that acted as a front to launder criminal proceeds into crypto. Suspicious transactions from one individual who allegedly laundered over $9.5 million led authorities to a complex money laundering scheme masquerading as a legitimate business activity. Authorities have accused the security company of blending clean business earnings with illicit cash and funneling the funds through a sales promotion company, a classic car dealership, and crypto exchanges. While blockchain technology can modernize financial systems, its open and decentralized nature attracts criminals. According to data from Chainalysis, over $100 billion worth of crypto flowed from illicit wallets to conversion services between 2019 and 2024. Additionally, criminals have started using crypto mixers, DeFi protocols, and cross-chain bridges to launder funds and evade detection. Despite these drawbacks, the blockchain’s transparency is a powerful tool to track illicit funds. SEC Working On Framework To Boost Crypto Innovation The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is working on an “innovation exemption” to facilitate the creation of on-chain products and services. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said on Monday during the crypto roundtable, headed by the SEC’s crypto task force, that he had directed SEC staff to consider a conditional exemption relief framework. According to Atkins, the temporary exemptions would relieve firms from specific regulatory requirements, helping foster innovation in emerging sectors, provided they meet the necessary conditions. Atkins believes this would speed up bringing on-chain products and services to the market while the SEC considers amendments to the Commission’s rules and regulations. “An innovation exemption could help fulfill President Trump’s vision to make America the crypto capital of the planet by encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, and other firms that are willing to comply with certain conditions to innovate with on-chain technologies in the United States.” Atkins has also asked staff to consider if amendments to the Commission’s rules and regulations would provide the needed accommodation for issuers and intermediaries looking to administer on-chain financial systems. “Most current securities rules and regulations are premised upon the regulation of issuers and intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, advisers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries.” CFPB’s Top Enforcement Official Resigns The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s top enforcement official has quit after accusing the Trump administration of undermining the agency’s mission and functioning in a scathing resignation email. Cara Peterson, the agency’s acting enforcement director, said that the Trump administration’s overhaul of the agency, including attempts to cut 90% of its workforce has made it impossible to ensure financial products are transparent, fair, and competitive for consumers. Peterson stated in her email, “I have served under every director and acting director in the bureau’s history, and never before have I seen the ability to perform our core mission so under attack. It has been devastating to see the bureau’s enforcement function being dismantled through thoughtless reductions in staff, inexplicable dismissals of cases, and terminations of negotiated settlements that let wrongdoers off the hook.” The CFPB handles complaints about US crypto exchanges and related companies. A weakening of the agency could lead to less oversight and more uncertainty in an industry plagued with fraud and scams. The CFBP’s dismantling reflects a broader pattern of regulatory unpredictability under the Trump administration. Peterson added that President Trump has no intention of enforcing the law in any meaningful way. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has stalled after reaching $110,000, with bulls unable to push the price higher. BTC crossed $110,000 on Monday but lost momentum and fell to $108,335 on Tuesday, leading to speculations of a decline to $105,000 or lower. However, it recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253 before dropping during the ongoing session. Market experts and investors are waiting for the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which could bring volatility to BTC. BTC soared to within touching distance of its all-time high before ultimately falling short. However, analysts expect the flagship cryptocurrency to surge to a new all-time high if current bullish sentiment persists. Some analysts believe market expectations of BTC surging to a new all-time high could prevent it from happening in the near term. According to Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivian, there is growing anticipation for BTC to reach a new all-time high on social media. However, he pointed out that since the market moves opposite to the expectation of retail traders, it isn’t quite ready for another bullish surge. Quinlivian stated, “It wouldn’t be surprising if we do break through very soon after we see a few frustrating ‘close calls’ that cause small traders to turn sour and impatient on BTC, neutralizing this level of optimism.” Analysts also pointed out that historically, Q3 has been Bitcoin’s weakest, with returns averaging just over 6%. However, Q4 ranks among the strongest, delivering average returns of over 85%. Derive Head of Research Dr Sean Dawson believes BTC will likely underperform during the third quarter, highlighting macroeconomic uncertainty as a significant concern for investors. Dawson stated, “Despite political pressure for rate cuts, the Fed seems poised to keep interest rates steady, which could dampen Bitcoin’s appeal for outsized returns.” BTC traded in positive territory the previous weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,779. The price fell to an intraday low of $103,768 on Monday before recovering to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price dropped almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at 104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Source: TradingView BTC recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $104,378. Buyers retained control over the weekend as the price rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC started the week positively, rising over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,251. The price fell to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday before recovering to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. The current session sees BTC down almost 1%, trading around $109,406, as sellers look to lower the price. Buyers will look to regain control and push BTC past $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) recovered from a sluggish start to Tuesday to register a substantial increase and cross $2,800 as bullish sentiment around the asset intensified thanks to growing institutional interest. However, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is back in the red during the ongoing session and is down over 1%, trading around $2,780. While ETH is trading in positive territory, new data from Kraken suggests it could face heightened volatility after ETH's open interest surged to an all-time high, indicating an increase in speculative activity. Alexia Theodorou, head of derivatives at Kraken, stated, “Open interest in ETH perpetual on Kraken reached an all-time high of 30,000 ETH earlier this week, signaling a notable uptick in speculative activity around the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.” The spike in derivatives activity is likely due to growing institutional inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs. “While funding rates remain mildly bullish, the market has yet to form a clear directional consensus, with the long/short ratio still well below its January peak.” ETH price action was mixed the previous weekend as it registered a marginal drop on Saturday before rising 0.44% on Sunday to settle at $2,539. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price registered an increase of almost 3% to cross the 20-day SMA and $2,600 and settle at $2,607. ETH registered a marginal drop on Tuesday as buyers lost momentum but recovered on Wednesday to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,607. Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as ETH plunged over 7%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $2,415. Despite the bearish sentiment, ETH recovered on Friday, rising 2.63% to $2,479. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price rose almost 2% to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,525. However, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, dropping 0.57% to $2,511. ETH started the week on a bullish note, surging almost 7% to cross the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settle at $2,680. Bullish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as the price rose over 5% to cross $2,800 and settle at $2,816. The current session sees ETH down 1.53%, trading around $2,774. If sellers retain control, the price could slip to $2,500 or lower. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continued its upward trajectory despite facing selling pressure on Tuesday and falling to a low of $156. However, it rebounded to reclaim $160 and settle at $165. The altcoin has extended its gains during the ongoing session, with the price marginally up, trading around $165. The positive sentiment around the asset is due to reports that the SEC may approve a Solana ETF within the next few months. The regulator has asked prospective issuers to submit amended S-1 registration statements by next week. According to sources, the SEC will comment on the updated filings within 30 days. The changes in the filings center around two key areas: How issuers will handle in-kind redemptions and whether staking will be incorporated into the ETF structure. Several asset managers, including VanEck, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, and 21Shares, are planning to offer Solana ETFs. SOL faced selling pressure the previous weekend but registered a marginal increase on Saturday and rose almost 1% on Sunday to settle at $157. It lost momentum on Monday, dropping to a low of $151 before settling at $156, ultimately registering a marginal increase. SOL raced to an intraday high of $164 on Tuesday but could not stay at this level and fell to $155. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.29% to $153. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL plunged nearly 6%, slipping below $150 and settling at $144. Despite the selling pressure, SOL recovered on Friday, rising 2.47% to $147. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control over the weekend as SOL rose 1.51% on Saturday and 1.56% on Sunday to reclaim $150 and settle at $152. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rose 5.66% to cross the 50-day SMA and settle at $161. SOL faced selling pressure on Tuesday as it fell to an intraday low of $156. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 2.44% and settle at $165. The current session sees the price up almost 1%, trading around $166. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) is also trading in positive territory after increasing significantly over the past few sessions. XRP bulls are setting their sights on a move to $2.50 and beyond as odds for an XRP ETF jumped to 98% on Polymarket. Multiple XRP ETF applications from major players, including Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares, signal strong demand for regulated XRP investment vehicles.

ICP traded in positive territory the previous weekend, rising 2.29% on Saturday and 0.61% on Sunday to settle at $4.94. The price pushed higher on Monday, rising nearly 4% to cross $5 and settle at $5.13. ICP raced to an intraday high of $5.59 on Tuesday as bullish sentiment intensified.

2025-06-11T10:51:16,"XRP Created Thousands of Millionaires: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Same Opportunity with 233% Guaranteed Launch Returns","The post XRP Created Thousands of Millionaires: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Same Opportunity with 233% Guaranteed Launch Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2017, XRP shocked the crypto world by turning average investors into millionaires seemingly overnight. For those who missed that golden run, another opportunity may already be unfolding—one with even more upside, and this time, it’s built on stronger tech and real accessibility. Meet Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a new asset surging in both hype and substance—and currently sitting at just $7 in its presale phase. XRP Was Just the Beginning XRP’s explosive rise to $2.19 and beyond created more than just financial gains—it birthed a generation of early believers who cashed in when the world least expected it. While XRP still plays a role in the altcoin space, its growth curve has matured. Meanwhile, new contenders are stepping up—especially ones like Bitcoin Solaris that offer next-gen infrastructure, unmatched scalability, and a launch strategy engineered for wealth generation. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just promising a moonshot. It’s building the launchpad. Why Bitcoin Solaris Feels Like a Once-in-a-Decade Opportunity At its core, Bitcoin Solaris offers a technological evolution rooted in a dual-consensus hybrid model—a base layer secured by Proof of Work (PoW) for resilience, and an upper Solaris Layer powered by high-speed Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). The result? A robust blockchain that delivers over 10,000 TPS, while consuming 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin. But tech alone isn’t why BTC-S is capturing headlines. Its appeal is built around mobile-first accessibility, intuitive mining, and most importantly—an economic model designed to make its users rich. Built-in validator rotation system ensures fairness and decentralization. Smart contracts are fully audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins to meet enterprise-grade standards. Its low entry cost during presale is already drawing comparisons to early Bitcoin and Solana phases. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Mining Reimagined for Normal People What if mining wasn’t reserved for big rigs and massive energy bills? Bitcoin Solaris is breaking the mold through its upcoming Solaris Nova App , which allows users to mine from smartphones, desktops, and even browsers. Backed by adaptive algorithms, built-in security, and gamification features, it’s not just mining—it’s a movement. Whether you’re a casual user or hardcore enthusiast, BTC-S makes mining simple, secure, and profitable without needing a warehouse of hardware. 233% Launch Returns? Why This Presale Is Turning Heads With less than 8 weeks remaining in its presale window, Bitcoin Solaris is gaining unprecedented momentum. Over 11,000 users have already jumped in, pushing the raise over $4.1 million with no signs of slowing down. At the current $7 price, investors are positioning themselves ahead of a $20 launch, locking in a 233% return before the public even gets access. BTC-S isn’t just another presale—it’s one of the shortest and most explosive we’ve seen this cycle. Bitcoin Solaris is also becoming a staple in YouTube crypto circles. A detailed review by 2Bit Crypto outlines why so many investors believe this project is uniquely positioned for breakout success. How Bitcoin Solaris Could Make You Rich When people talk about wealth creation in crypto, it often centers around timing. But BTC-S is making a new argument: it’s not just about when you invest—it’s about what you invest in. Bitcoin Solaris is built for real-world scaling: Instant finality in under 2 seconds Cross-chain bridges enabling DeFi expansion Decentralized governance built into the core protocol Mobile-first strategy enabling millions to mine Add a low entry point and massive upside potential—and BTC-S starts looking like the smartest $1,000 you could deploy in 2025. Roadmap That Supports Long-Term Value BTC-S isn’t a pump-and-dump. It’s backed by a clearly structured roadmap that spans eight phases, including: Q3 2026: Full launch of the mainnet and Solaris Nova app Q4 2026: Mining Power Marketplace goes live 2027: Layer-2 scaling, DEX launch, and Fortune 500 partnerships 2028+: AI integrations and blockchain education initiatives Each milestone positions BTC-S to expand its ecosystem and multiply its real-world use cases. Final Verdict If you missed XRP’s moonshot, you now have a second chance—one with more transparency, better tech, and a presale price that feels like a throwback to 2011. Bitcoin Solaris has the infrastructure, team, and momentum to deliver not just 2X or 5X—but real 20X potential. All you need is to act before this window closes.

2025-06-11T04:32:43,"ETH Technical Analysis as ETH Futures Conquers $2800","<p>Ethereum (ETH) Futures: Comprehensive Analysis & Institutional Bullish Signals</p><p>The past weeks have seen Ethereum (ETH) futures steadily gaining momentum, marked by increasing trading volumes and institutional inflows. The evolving landscape of Ethereum ETFs further supports a bullish short-term narrative, driving increased optimism among crypto traders and investors. This article provides a detailed technical and fundamental overview of ETH futures, enriched by institutional data and a strategic technical analysis.</p><p>Technical Analysis Video Transcript:</p><p>I present the bigger picture of where ETH futures is at, and the next targets above the current price, that I am looking at, in this ETH futures technical analysis video.</p><p>We notice an important purple channel shown in the video. I expect Ether to cross upward again, creating another touchpoint on the red resistance and breaking out above.</p><p>From the volume profile analysis and other methodologies from tradeCompass at ForexLive.com and investingLive.com, the next key price targets I anticipate are $2,882, and possibly - $2,920, and $2,967. Reaching the second target (around 2,920) implies another approximate 4% move, offering an attractive opportunity for day traders and short-term swing traders.</p><p>However, we might see a scenario where Ether revisits either the upper boundary of the purple channel or even retests the red line around 2,825. These specific figures require referencing additional charts, but the current orientation shows bulls firmly maintaining control. Personally, I would not choose to short here, expecting a decline.</p><p>Sophisticated traders are likely to take profits into liquidity spikes, with a minimum upside target near $2,880.</p><p>Please trade ETH and other crypto assets at your own risk only. This is not financial advice. </p><p>Importantly, if we observe two consecutive bearish daily candles, each clearly closing below the aforementioned resistance, this would challenge the current bullish bias and could hand control back to bears. Lastly, beware of fake-outs on lower timeframes.</p><p>Institutional Support and ETF Inflows:</p><p>Recent institutional data strongly underpins Ethereum’s bullish outlook. Notably, on June 10, Ethereum Spot ETFs witnessed a significant net inflow of $125 million, prominently driven by major asset managers:</p><ul><li><p>Blackrock: $80.60M</p></li><li><p>Fidelity: $26.30M</p></li><li><p>Bitwise: $8.40M</p></li><li><p>Grayscale: $9.70M</p></li></ul><p>This robust institutional participation highlights strategic accumulation and bullish sentiment among major players, indicating that smart money continues to favor Ethereum.</p><p>Volume Shift ETH vs. BTC:</p><p>A critical volume shift further cements ETH’s bullish momentum. Ethereum's trading volume increased dramatically by approximately $29.60 billion within a 24-hour timeframe, contrasting starkly with Bitcoin’s volume drop of $28.31 billion. This divergence demonstrates a clear investor shift, possibly indicating a rotation away from Bitcoin toward Ethereum, potentially driven by fundamental developments or favorable sentiment towards ETH’s utility and upcoming network improvements.</p><p>ETH Futures Market Data:</p><ul><li><p>Current ETH Futures Price: $2,806.5</p></li><li><p>Daily Range: $2,785.0 - $2,845.5</p></li><li><p>52-week Range: $1,387.0 - $4,142.5</p></li><li><p>Volume & Open Interest:</p><ul><li><p>Volume: 1.63K contracts (moderate liquidity)</p></li><li><p>Open Interest: 15.47K contracts (significant institutional presence)</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Performance indicators remain strong:</p><ul><li><p>Weekly (1W): +6.95%</p></li><li><p>Monthly (1M): +10.66%</p></li><li><p>Quarterly (3M): +46.84%</p></li></ul><p>These indicators highlight a robust short-term recovery and bullish momentum in Ethereum futures.</p><p>ETH Futures Forward Curve Analysis:</p><p>The futures forward curve projects steadily increasing Ethereum prices into mid-2026, aligning with heightened institutional interest and bullish long-term outlook. This trajectory underscores market confidence in Ethereum’s ongoing developments and strategic positioning in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Conclusion and Key Takeaways for Ethereum traders:</p><ul><li><p>Ethereum futures exhibit significant bullish short-term momentum.</p></li><li><p>Institutional ETF inflows confirm robust investor confidence.</p></li><li><p>Dramatic positive volume shift highlights market rotation favoring Ethereum.</p></li><li><p>Critical technical resistance points at $2,882, $2,920, and $2,967 should guide short-term trading strategies.</p></li></ul><p>Risk Disclaimer:
