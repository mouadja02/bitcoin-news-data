2025-06-11T08:53:33,"Louisiana establishes legislative committee to study crypto, blockchain, and AI","The US state of Louisiana has passed House Resolution 317 to establish a legislative subcommittee to study the impact of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and artificial intelligence. Introduced by Representative Mark Wright, the resolution was adopted following a June 10 Regular Session of the House of Representatives, where it passed with unanimous support in a 90–0 vote. HR 317 creates a new subcommittee under the House Committee on Commerce to assess how emerging technologies are shaping the state’s economy, legislation, and daily life. The subcommittee is required to begin its work before September 1, 2025, and submit a final report by February 1, 2026, to the House Committee on Commerce and the David R. Poynter Legislative Research Library. The report will include an analysis of current use cases for AI, blockchain, and cryptocurrency in Louisiana, as well as a comparison with developments in other US states. The panel is tasked with evaluating cybersecurity risks, privacy concerns, and regulatory challenges, alongside opportunities related to economic growth, workforce development, and public-sector innovation. It will also explore whether new state laws are needed to manage these technologies safely and effectively. You might also like: Elon Musk called it an “abomination” — but the Big Beautiful Bill might be crypto’s backdoor stimulus To support an inclusive review process, the resolution calls on the subcommittee to host public hearings and gather expert testimony, while also engaging educators, students, and business owners through dedicated community forums. The subcommittee will consist of members of the House Committee on Commerce, with the committee chair or a designee presiding over the first meeting. Over the years, Louisiana has firmly positioned itself as a pro-crypto pioneer . In September 2024, the state became the first in the U.S. to accept cryptocurrency payments for government services, allowing residents to pay fines and fees with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Lightning Network, and USD Coin. Representative Wright has continued to champion digital asset integration, having earlier authored a Bitcoin Rights bill that affirms citizens’ rights to transact in Bitcoin, prohibits central bank digital currency trials, and safeguards home-based crypto mining. However, Louisiana has not yet introduced legislation to establish a state-level Bitcoin reserve , a move other states are already pursuing. Neighbouring state Texas, for instance, recently passed Senate Bill 21, creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve managed by the state Comptroller, and it now awaits the governor’s approval . According to data from crypto legislation tracker Bitcoin Laws, at least 16 U.S. states were reviewing similar bills as of June 11.

The Blockchain Group, Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury Company listed on Euronext Growth Paris, has received an overwhelming shareholder approval to issue shares and securities worth over €10 billion. This includes the ability to offer new shares either with or without preferential subscription rights, through public offerings or private placements to select investors. These new financial delegations will support the company’s goal of increasing its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings per share on a fully diluted basis over time as part of its Bitcoin Treasury Company strategy.

Lummis says the tax rules are old and don’t work for the fast-growing world of digital assets. Let’s take a closer look at what’s going on and how this could change the game for crypto in America. Flawed Rules Target Crypto Investors Senator Lummis, known for championing crypto causes in Congress, says America’s tax system is too old for modern crypto businesses. She believes it’s stopping new ideas from growing and is hurting miners, who have to pay tax twice, once when they earn block rewards and again when they sell the coins. This double tax, Lummis argues, makes it hard for miners to make money and expand their businesses. But it’s not just miners who are struggling. DeFi users also worry because they might get taxed on every small transaction, even if they don’t make any real profit. Lummis says these unfair rules are holding crypto back, and it’s time to fix this. How Lummis Addresses This Problem To address these problems, Senator Cynthia Lummis is pushing Congress to use the reconciliation process. This method lets lawmakers pass changes quickly with a simple majority. Her mission is to narrow down the meaning of “broker” and remove extra rules that make it hard for crypto businesses to grow. Senator Lummis has also introduced the BITCOIN Act , which aims to make Bitcoin a key part of the country’s financial plans. She said her office has already talked to the Senate Finance Committee to start these changes. Lawmakers Looking For Crypto Reforms Meanwhile, lawmakers in Washington are busy discussing a series of new crypto rules that could totally change how things work. This week, Congress is getting ready to vote on the GENIUS Act, while the CLARITY Act is also moving ahead. With all these plans in motion, there’s a growing feeling that Senator Lummis’s push for fairer crypto taxes might finally become reality.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-queen-senator-lummis-says-unfair-tax-laws-threaten-bitcoin/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T08:47:17,"Altcoins With Massive Gains and New ATHs as Bitcoin Flirts With $110K (Market Watch)","Bitcoin’s price attempted to take down the $110,000 level and perhaps head to a new all-time high once again hours ago, but it didn’t see much success. Many altcoins have posted mindblowing gains over the past 24-48 hours, led by Uniswap’s notable 16% surge and SPX’s 15% pump. BTC Flirts With New ATH The primary cryptocurrency experienced a substantial correction at the end of the past business week amid the public spat between US President Donald Trump and former ally Elon Musk. At the time, BTC plummeted to a multi-week low of under $100,500. Although some expected a breakdown to a five-digit price territory, the bulls stepped up and didn’t allow another decline. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover some ground and went back to $104,000-$106,000 during the weekend. The market started to pick up once the new business week began, and BTC shot above $110,500 on Tuesday for the first time in about 14 days . It was stopped there at first, but the bulls tried once again in the past 6 hours. However, to no avail so far, and BTC is back to just under $110,000. Here are the most vital support and resistance lines on the way to a fresh peak. For now, its market cap has remained sluggish at $2.180 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has been reduced to under 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView HYPE’s New ATH HYPE continues to be the rockstar of the altcoin space, registering frequent all-time highs. The latest came earlier today when the asset jumped to almost $43 after a double-digit surge. However, there are even bigger gainers over the past 24 hours, as UNI has soared by 16%, followed by SPX (15%), XDC (13%), OP (12%), A (12%), and ARB (11%). The top performers from the larger-cap altcoins include AAVE, BCH, LINK, SOL, and DOGE, with price increases of up to 7%. Ethereum soared to $2,800 earlier today but was stopped, while XRP continues to fight with the $2.3 resistance. The crypto market cap is up by almost $50 billion and now sits at $3.580 trillion.

2025-06-11T08:44:09,"Bitwise Announces Its Big Forecast for Bitcoin (BTC)! ""By the End of 2025…""","Even though the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is breaking new records, it is still considered to be below its fair value. At this point, Bitwise analysts André Dragosch and Ayush Tripathi finally explained the fair value of Bitcoin. Accordingly, analysts predict that Bitcoin could rise above $200,000 by the end of the year and reach its fair value of $230,000. Trump's proposed tax cuts and rising U.S. debt are the key drivers of the rally, analysts said, supporting Bitcoin's rise as a hedge against default risks. “Bitcoin’s scarcity and durability put it in a unique position to benefit from both financial instability and improving market sentiment. If these trends continue, the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin could end up shattering price expectations.” Analysts stated that Bitcoin fell to $100,000 with the tension between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, but recovered in a very short time, and said that the bull is solid and that it is a sign that the rise will continue. As a result, analysts have stated that they expect the rise to continue and rise to what they consider to be Bitcoin’s fair value of $230,000 by the end of 2025. Apart from Bitwise analysts, Bitwise CEO also announced his BTC price expectation. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley claimed that no one will sell when Bitcoin reaches $130,000-$150,000. In his post from the X account, Horsley said that if the Bitcoin price reaches $130,000-150,000, the current sales of investors who bought around $100,000 will stop. The famous CEO went a little further and said that when BTC reaches this level, investors who need liquidity will borrow money and invest in Bitcoin, which will push the price of Bitcoin even higher. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T08:32:21,"Make Money Fast: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Guarantees 233% Returns at Launch, 10X Potential Within First Year","In the crypto world, fortune favors the fast. Blink and you might miss the next opportunity to ride a wealth wave from ground floor to moon. Bitcoin did it. It minted over 100,000 millionaires during its early rise. But the game has changed. Today, the barriers to entry are higher, the competition stiffer, and the rewards harder to reach—unless you’re looking in the right place. Right now, that place is Bitcoin Solaris. Bitcoin Solaris: The New-Gen Wealth Machine Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is more than a coin—it’s a high-performance financial ecosystem built from the ground up to do what Bitcoin can no longer do: scale, reward, and include everyone. At its core is a dual-consensus architecture that combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) for rock-solid security with Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for scalability and speed. This allows BTC-S to process over 10,000 transactions per second with near-instant finality. The tech is reinforced by an energy-efficient design, mobile-first mining via the upcoming Solaris Nova App, and an ecosystem of smart contracts that opens the door to DeFi, real-world tokenization, and more. All of it is backed by security audits from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins . Why Bitcoin Solaris Will Make People Rich This isn’t just about technology. It’s about timing and access. Bitcoin Solaris opens the door to wealth creation in ways Bitcoin never could: The Solaris Nova App allows anyone to mine directly from their smartphone or laptop. Staking is flexible and DeFi-ready through a liquid system where staked BTC-S is converted to tradable sBTC-S, allowing users to earn while retaining control over their assets. Real-world use cases—DeFi, supply chain, gaming, healthcare—position BTC-S as a utility-first token, not a speculative gamble. The upcoming launch of the Solaris Nova App puts mining power in the hands of the many, not the few. It’s what Bitcoin could have been—if it launched in 2025. Staking Made Simple, Liquid, and Powerful Bitcoin Solaris introduces a next-gen staking system designed for both power users and beginners. Instead of locking funds, BTC-S allows you to stake and receive a tradable token, sBTC-S, at a 1:1 ratio. You earn rewards and retain full liquidity. Rewards without losing access to your assets Use sBTC-S in DeFi for lending, yield, or governance Staking integrated into the upcoming Solaris Nova App Automated validator delegation with no technical setup This system enhances decentralization and capital efficiency while making passive income more accessible than ever. A Smarter, Faster, Fairer Bitcoin Is Here—Step Into BTC-S Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: The Mining Difference Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Mining Device ASIC only Phones, laptops, desktops, ASICs Energy Use High 99.95% lower Block Time 10 min 5 sec (DPoS layer) Transaction Speed 7 TPS 100,000 TPS Accessibility Tech-savvy only Anyone, anywhere Rewards PoW only PoW + Staking + Validator incentives BTC-S is not trying to replace Bitcoin—it’s solving what Bitcoin left broken. Momentum Builds as Influencers Take Notice As momentum surges, so does public interest. Ben Crypto recently released a detailed review unpacking why Bitcoin Solaris is generating serious buzz. From smart contract capability to its wealth-generating potential, his video reflects what thousands of investors are realizing: BTC-S is a rare alignment of tech, timing, and traction. Presale Frenzy: Why Investors Are Scrambling In The Bitcoin Solaris presale is currently in Phase 7, priced at just $7—set to jump to $8 soon, with a launch price of $20. That’s a guaranteed 233% return baked into the timeline. But that’s only part of the story. Over 11,000 investors have already joined More than $4.1 million has been raised Less than 8 weeks remain before launch One of the shortest, most explosive presales in crypto history And with mobile mining expected to onboard thousands more users post-launch, the upward pressure is only beginning. You can explore the presale and join the BTC-S momentum at the official Bitcoin Solaris site . Behind the Scenes: A Scalable Engine So how does all this work under the hood? Dual-consensus architecture balances speed and security. Validator rotation every 24 hours ensures fairness. Rust-based smart contracts support real-world dApps with ultra-low fees. Zero-Knowledge Proofs add optional privacy for sensitive use cases. Up to 100,000 TPS ensures future-proof scalability. This is not just theory—it’s running on infrastructure backed by audited code and decades of blockchain evolution. Final Verdict: The Fastest Path to Crypto Gains? With an ecosystem that empowers miners, stakers, developers, and everyday users, Bitcoin Solaris feels like catching Bitcoin in 2011—but smarter. Its low entry price, high return potential, and inclusive design make it one of the rare projects that could deliver both short-term gains and long-term value. If you’re looking to make money fast—without sacrificing security or scalability—Bitcoin Solaris might be your clearest shot in 2025.

2025-06-11T08:31:31,"BTC ATH Within Reach: Glassnode Maps Support, Warns of Underpriced Volatility","Bitcoin (BTC) is once again knocking on the door of its all-time high (ATH), trading around $109,500 early Wednesday, a mere 2% shy of its $111,800 peak set nearly three weeks ago. Yet beneath the surface of this upward momentum lies a market defined by compressed volatility, long-term holder profit-taking, and a growing divergence between futures and on-chain sentiment. Long-Term Holders Cash In, But Supply Stays Sticky Glassnode’s latest Week On-Chain report outlines how BTC recovered from a local low of $100,400, where demand re-emerged after a brief but sharp 9% drawdown. According to the analytics platform, this dip rattled investor confidence, with the Fear and Greed Index momentarily entering “Fear” territory. However, the lack of mass panic selling, with only $200 million in on-chain losses realized, showed that capitulation was limited to the newest and most speculative market entrants. Despite the resilience, Glassnode warned of increased profit-taking activity among long-term holders (LTHs). The cohort locked in a peak of $930 million per day in realized profits, a level historically associated with overheated markets. Interestingly, this cycle seems to be defying tradition: despite the profit-taking, the proportion of Bitcoin wealth held by LTHs has increased. The report attributed this “unique market dynamic” to intense “maturation and accumulation pressures” overwhelming selling. A key driver appears to be the spot Bitcoin ETFs and institutional participation, effectively locking up supply in long-term custody and making LTH wealth “significantly stickier.” Indeed, on Monday alone, six out of eleven U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $386.2 million in inflows. These signals are also mirrored by recent data from CryptoQuant, which confirmed that U.S. buyers are reasserting dominance , with the Coinbase Premium index hitting a three-month high and the 90-day Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) flipping green for the first time in four months. Critical Levels for the Path Ahead Looking at the markets, at the time of this writing, BTC had posted an almost negligible uptick of 0.1% in the last 24 hours. Over the past seven days, the gains stand at 3.8%, with the asset up 5.3% for the month. Meanwhile, daily trading volume sits at $34 billion, with a circulating supply nearing 19.9 million BTC. With Bitcoin perched just below its ATH, the Glassnode report made clear the following technical and on-chain levels: Downside Support: The $97,600 short-term holders (STH) cost basis is the critical floor. Holding above it will maintain a bullish structure. However, a break below risks shifting sentiment. Furthermore, strong support lies around the 111 DMA ($92,900) and 200 DMA ($95,400). Upside Resistance: Breaking the ATH at $111,814 is the first hurdle. Beyond that, the next major on-chain resistance zone sits at $115,400. Additionally, sparse on-chain volume above current prices suggests a potential “air gap” exists, and if demand is strong enough, a swift move higher could occur once the ATH is surpassed. However, volatility remains a wildcard, with Glassnode warning of a dense cluster of coins acquired near the current price that could potentially amplify reactions to moves, even as options markets remain oddly subdued. At-the-money implied volatility (ATM IV) has yet to reflect these brewing tensions, potentially signaling underpriced risk.

The company aims to capitalize on renewed enthusiasm for digital assets driven by pro-crypto policy signals from the Trump administration and follows last week's IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), whose shares soared 168% on the first day of trading. The FT did not distinguish between Bullish Exchange and its parent, Bullish Group, the Peter Thiel-backed company that is also the parent of CoinDesk. The confidential filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission allows Bullish to prepare for a public listing while keeping financial details private for now. Jefferies will serve as lead underwriter, according to the Financial Times. Bullish previously attempted to go public in a SPAC deal in 2021. The plan collapsed the following year amid market volatility. Bullish Exchange is a Gibraltar regulated trading platform. This time, the IPO filing comes as bitcoin trades around $110,000 and crypto sentiment strengthens amid favorable regulatory tailwinds following the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. The group is led by CEO Tom Farley, a former president of NYSE Group, and chaired by Brendan Blumer of Block.one. Thiel is a co-founder of PayPal (PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook, now Meta (META). Jefferies declined to comment to the FT. Bullish did not respond to the FT and had not responded to a CoinDesk request for comment by publication time.

In a recent interview , he stated: “Winter is not coming back. If Bitcoin is not going to zero, it is going to $1 million.” This bold prediction comes amid growing support from the U.S. government , increasing institutional interest , and strong inflows into the Bitcoin ETF market . Saylor’s remarks have sparked fresh excitement across the cryptocurrency space. MicroStrategy Holds Over 582,000 BTC Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, is the largest public holder of Bitcoin, with 582,000 BTC , valued at over $63.7 billion . Other major public companies include: Marathon Digital – 49,179 BTC Riot Platforms – 19,225 BTC CleanSpark Inc – 12,502 BTC In total, public companies hold approximately 763,479 BTC , representing 3.636% of the total Bitcoin supply . Bitcoin Supply Remains Scarce Amid Daily Demand Currently, only around 450 BTC are mined each day (144 blocks/day * 3.125 BTC reward per block post- April 2024 halving ). Saylor pointed out that if institutional demand continues to absorb this daily supply, the Bitcoin price will inevitably rise . Institutional interest has surged, driven by U.S. regulatory support and a shift in political sentiment. On just one day, over $431.20 million flowed into Bitcoin Spot ETFs , and this month already saw 4 positive ETF inflow days out of 7. Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Gaining Global Attention Countries are also starting to recognize Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Recently, Pakistan announced plans to establish a national Bitcoin reserve —a major shift for a country that once rejected the digital economy. Meanwhile, the United States established its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on March 6, 2025. Currently, it holds confiscated BTC as a national asset. JAN3 Founder Samson Mow warned that Pakistan may front-run the U.S. in Bitcoin accumulation unless the U.S. acts quickly. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why MARA Stock Could Outperform Bitcoin in This Bull Market , Trump Administration Boosts Bitcoin Sentiment Saylor praised the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration , which has followed through on campaign promises by introducing favorable crypto policies.

2025-06-11T08:21:38,"Bitfinex Alpha | Bitcoin Tiến Gần Đến Bước Ngoặt Quan Trọng","Xem Full Báo Cáo Đăng ký trên BItfinex Một đợt tăng giá chuẩn sách giáo khoa của Bitcoin, được thúc đẩy bởi nhu cầu giao ngay mạnh mẽ, hoạt động chốt lời từ các nhà đầu tư dài hạn và sự gia tăng rủi ro vĩ mô, đã đưa tài sản này giảm hơn 10% so với mức cao nhất mọi thời đại (ATH). Đỉnh điểm của đợt giảm giá vào ngày 5 tháng 6 chứng kiến hơn 875 triệu đô la bị thanh lý vị thế long chỉ trong một ngày – minh chứng rõ ràng cho việc thị trường đang trải qua quá trình giảm đòn bẩy mạnh mẽ. Tổng cộng, hơn 1,9 tỷ đô la đã bị thanh lý trong tuần qua, giúp thị trường reset lại hệ thống đòn bẩy. Cấu trúc kỹ thuật cho thấy đợt tăng giá của BTC được hỗ trợ bởi nhu cầu thực tế, như biểu hiện qua chuỗi tăng giá từng nấc do giao dịch giao ngay dẫn dắt, với các vùng tích lũy quan trọng hình thành ở mức $93,000–96,000 và $102,000–104,000. Các chỉ báo trên chuỗi hiện đang phát tín hiệu về áp lực bán tăng lên khi các nhà đầu tư lâu năm bắt đầu phân phối tài sản. Chỉ số Phân Bố Nguồn Cung Đã Tiêu (SSD) và Dải Chi Phí Cơ Sở của Nhà Đầu Tư Ngắn Hạn (STH) vẽ ra lộ trình rõ ràng. Mức SSD 0,95 tại $103,700 đánh dấu vùng hỗ trợ đầu tiên, tiếp theo là $97,100 (Chi Phí Cơ Sở STH) và $95,600 (SSD 0,85), với $83,200 là mức rủi ro chính. Những mức này rất quan trọng vì chúng phản ánh các vùng chi phí cơ sở của các nhà đầu tư lớn và người mua gần đây, đóng vai trò là điểm tái nhập lệnh hoặc kích hoạt thanh lý tiềm năng. Tóm lại, Bitcoin hiện đang đứng trước ngã ba đường – cân bằng giữa hỗ trợ cơ bản và đà tăng giá suy yếu, chờ đợi cú hích vĩ mô tiếp theo. Khung cảnh kinh tế vĩ mô của Mỹ tiếp tục lộ ra nhiều điểm yếu khi tốc độ tăng trưởng việc làm trong tháng 5 chậm lại , phản ánh áp lực ban đầu từ căng thẳng thương mại và sự bất định về thuế quan. Mặc dù mức tăng lương vẫn ổn định, nhưng lực lượng lao động đang thu hẹp và các sửa đổi giảm xuống đối với dữ liệu việc làm trong quá khứ cho thấy khả năng chống chịu của thị trường lao động đang bắt đầu suy yếu. Đồng thời, cả ngành sản xuất và dịch vụ đều co lại , do chi phí đầu vào tăng cao và nhu cầu sụt giảm, nhấn mạnh tác động lan rộng của thuế quan đối với nền kinh tế. Chi tiêu xây dựng cũng giảm liên tiếp trong ba tháng, và áp lực lạm phát đang gia tăng khi doanh nghiệp gặp khó khăn trong việc hấp thụ chi phí tăng cao. Trên mặt trận thương mại, thâm hụt của Mỹ thu hẹp do nhập khẩu giảm – đặc biệt từ Trung Quốc – nhưng sự sụt giảm này phản ánh nhu cầu yếu hơn chứ không phải sức mạnh, gây lo ngại về tình trạng thiếu hàng tồn kho trong tương lai và lạm phát gia tăng. Trong khi đó, sự quan tâm của nhà đầu tư đối với trái phiếu dài hạn của Mỹ đang giảm sút, với dữ liệu đấu giá và thị trường tương lai chỉ ra sự hoài nghi về sự ổn định tài chính. Việc áp dụng tiền điện tử đang tăng tốc trên nhiều lĩnh vực, với IG Group trở thành công ty niêm yết đầu tiên tại Anh cung cấp giao dịch tiền điện tử giao ngay cho nhà đầu tư cá nhân. Thông qua hợp tác với Uphold, IG hiện cho phép mua trực tiếp bitcoin và các token khác, đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ các sản phẩm phái sinh mang tính đầu cơ sang quyền sở hữu tài sản thực tế. Động thái này trùng hợp với đề xuất của Cơ quan Quản Lý Tài Chính Anh (FCA) dỡ bỏ lệnh cấm đối với các ghi chú giao dịch trao đổi tiền điện tử (cETNs) dành cho nhà đầu tư cá nhân, báo hiệu sự hỗ trợ quy định rộng rãi hơn cho tài sản kỹ thuật số. Trong khi đó, Metaplanet của Nhật Bản đã công bố kế hoạch huy động vốn cổ phần trị giá ¥850 tỷ ($5,4 tỷ) để mở rộng mạnh mẽ danh mục bitcoin của mình, đặt mục tiêu sở hữu 210,000 BTC vào năm 2027 – khẳng định vai trò ngày càng lớn của châu Á trong việc áp dụng tiền điện tử ở cấp độ tổ chức.

2025-06-11T07:40:50,"Why MARA Stock Could Outperform Bitcoin in This Bull Market","The post Why MARA Stock Could Outperform Bitcoin in This Bull Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many investors are keeping a close eye on MARA stock — the publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, Mara Holdings. While buying Bitcoin directly is one option, some prefer investing in Bitcoin mining stocks like MARA for several practical reasons, as explained by an analyst. Why Mining Stocks? Unlike holding Bitcoin, which requires managing private keys and digital wallets, mining stocks are traded like regular company shares on the stock market. This makes them easier for traditional investors to access. Plus, mining stocks come with fewer regulatory concerns compared to direct crypto investing and can even fit into retirement accounts. About Mara Holdings Founded in Florida in 2010, the company originally operated under the name Marathon Patent Group. It switched to Bitcoin mining in 2021 and later rebranded as Mara Holdings in 2024. Today, it’s one of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, known for using renewable energy and advanced cooling systems to run its operations. As of early 2025, Mara’s mining power reached over 54 exahashes per second — meaning its machines can make over 54 quintillion guesses per second while mining Bitcoin. In simple terms, it’s one of the fastest and most powerful mining setups out there. A Unique Bitcoin Strategy In mid-2024, MARA announced a full “HODL” strategy, deciding not to sell any of its mined Bitcoin to cover expenses. Instead, it started aggressively buying more Bitcoin from the market. To support this plan, MARA launched several stock offerings, including a massive $2 billion stock sale in March 2025. Thanks to this strategy, Mara has built up a huge Bitcoin reserve. In the first three months of 2025 alone, it mined 2,286 BTC, increasing its total holdings to over 48,100 BTC — the second-highest stash among public companies after Michael Saylor’s firm. The Bigger Picture Mara’s decision to hold onto its Bitcoin rather than sell it could significantly increase the company’s value, especially as Bitcoin’s price rises. Many other mining firms are now following a similar strategy, showing growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-11T07:30:06,"Deadly Or Disruptive? XRP Gets The COVID-19 Comparison From Finance Expert","Financial commentator Gary Cardone ignited a heated debate this week after he accused XRP of siding with authoritarian powers to stay relevant. His statements followed speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) could use the XRP Ledger to power its upcoming digital euro project. No formal decision has been made by the ECB, but the rumor alone was enough to stir strong opinions. Cardone Slams XRP And Christine Lagarde Cardone didn’t hold back in his comments. He said XRP would “take any path it needs to survive,” even if that meant teaming up with “the most oppressive people on the planet.” He called ECB President Christine Lagarde “Ms. Cringe” and claimed she wants to turn Europe into a “prison continent.” Is XRP The Covid-19 Of Finance? Expert Thinks So It didn’t stop there. Cardone compared the altcoin’s role in global finance to a second wave of Covid-19. “It’s Covid-19 Part Two in finance,” he posted. He also said supporting XRP is like voting for “European warmongers.” These comments lit a fire under the XRP community, who were quick to respond.

Some believe the Ledger is in the running. But so far, the central bank hasn’t confirmed anything. It hasn’t even committed to launching the digital euro yet. The European Parliament still needs to approve it. Ripple , the company tied to XRP, has held talks with central banks in countries like Palau and Georgia. They’ve already launched pilot programs with Ripple’s help. But that doesn’t mean the ECB is next in line. Despite the lack of official backing, XRP fans are hopeful. Any involvement with a central bank brings a level of legitimacy. For some, it’s exciting. For others, it’s a red flag. Supporters Push Back On Cardone’s Claims Crypto influencers wasted no time hitting back at Cardone. Robert Doyle, known online as Crypto Sensei, called the claims “factually wrong” and clarified there’s no proof the ECB picked XRP Ledger for anything. Moon Lambo, another well-known voice in the crypto community, said Cardone may have fallen for fake news. He even suggested Cardone is pushing an agenda, calling it “XRP Derangement Syndrome.” You suffer from the affliction known as $XRP derangement syndrome. — Moon Lambo (@MoonLamboio) May 10, 2025 Moon Lambo linked to the ECB’s official website, showing that no platform decisions have been made.

2025-06-11T07:25:11,"Analyst Makes Bold Claim: “Bitcoin Doesn’t Need the US, the US Needs Bitcoin” – Here’s Why","Cryptocurrency analyst Simeon Koch, in his latest analysis, drew attention to the strategic importance of Bitcoin for the economic and geopolitical future of the United States. According to Koch, Bitcoin has become indispensable not only for individual investors but also for the US government. Koch examined Donald Trump’s drastic change in attitude towards Bitcoin. Describing Bitcoin as a “valueless bubble” in 2019, Trump signed a decree in the White House declaring Bitcoin a “strategic state reserve” after his re-election in 2024. Koch argues that this change is not random but part of a deliberate plan. The economic part of this plan is that Trump’s family runs a crypto fund, invests in Bitcoin mining and makes millions with their own memecoins. But that’s not the real issue, Koch says. Alongside Trump, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also completely changed his view on Bitcoin over the years. While Fink once described Bitcoin as a “money laundering index,” he began to describe it as a “financial revolution” by 2023. Koch says that these changes in attitude are not so much about personal gain but rather an effort to maintain the US’s economic leadership. The US’s global supremacy is based on three pillars: the dollar being the global reserve currency, the high demand for US bonds and technological leadership. Bitcoin and crypto markets have the capacity to play a strategic role in all three of these areas. Since 2020, the US government debt has increased from $23 trillion to $36 trillion, while the money supply has increased from $1.8 trillion to $2.4 trillion. Koch says that this level of debt would have long ago bankrupted any other country, but the US has been able to carry the burden thanks to the dollar’s global position. Related News: Secret Bitcoin Activities of a Company Supported by Donald Trump in the US Have Been Revealed - Here Are the Details This is where the crypto market comes in. The stablecoin market is a huge liquidity pool with a size of around $250 billion. Large issuers like Tether back most of their reserves with US Treasury bonds. This gives the crypto sector an important role in indirect financing of US debt. Citing Standard Chartered’s analysis, Koch argues that the stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion by 2028, in which case stablecoin issuers alone would own 15% of U.S. bonds. According to Simeon Koch, Bitcoin and crypto markets in general have become not only an investment tool, but also a lifeline for the sustainability of the US economy. The shift towards crypto by both political and financial elites is not only due to individual interests, but also systemic needs. As a result, Koch says the U.S. needs Bitcoin more than ever to maintain its economic stability and global leadership: “This is no longer an option, it’s a necessity.” Just a few years ago, many US officials viewed the growing power of stablecoin issuers in the bond market as a threat to the national budget. But the picture has quickly changed. Today, the crypto industry is supported by regulatory frameworks and encouraged to grow, provided, of course, that major players like Tether and Circle remain loyal to the US and its dollar. To strengthen this connection, a new bill called the “GENIUS Act” is currently being discussed in the US Congress. According to the bill, stablecoin issuers will be required to back the majority of the digital assets they issue with US Treasury bonds. The idea behind this strategy is clear: The more bonds stablecoin companies buy, the more easily the US can finance its budget deficit. At the same time, the fact that these companies hold large amounts of dollar reserves allows excess liquidity to be drawn out of the system, giving the US Federal Reserve more leeway to stimulate the economy by printing new dollars. According to Koch, Trump and his team have a clear understanding that the crypto market is not only a “liquidity sponge” against inflation, but also a loyal buyer of US debt. Therefore, the government’s welcoming approach to the crypto market is a natural consequence of this conscious strategy. According to the analyst, Donald Trump’s goal of making the US a global crypto leader also fits perfectly with this equation. The stronger the blockchain, the more transactions are made in US dollars. This means more dollar reserves are drawn into the system. If the dollar’s dominance in the crypto market is maintained, the US could also offset potential losses in the petrodollar system. For decades, the dollar’s dominant role in oil trading has been a cornerstone of US economic dominance. Now, crypto has the potential to take on that role. But this new collaboration is a double-edged sword: the crypto market is both gaining more traction and demand, and increasing its reliance on US-centric monetary policies and bonds. According to Simeon Koch’s analysis, Trump’s call to “never sell your Bitcoin” stems not from a crypto belief, but from a cold-blooded geostrategic calculation. *This is not investment advice.

With only 450 BTC mined daily, Saylor warns that $50M in buying pressure can drive prices sharply higher. Institutions, ETFs, and governments are accelerating Bitcoin accumulation. Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, has dismissed speculation that a new crypto winter is on the horizon, doubling down on his bullish Bitcoin outlook. Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday , Saylor stated, “Winter is not coming back. We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” His comments arrive amid a tightening Bitcoin supply and increased institutional interest. Saylor: Only 450 Bitcoin Mined Daily According to Saylor, just 450 BTC are available for sale each day from miners, amounting to roughly $50 million at Bitcoin’s current price of $109,859. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” he said, adding that public companies are now absorbing “the entire natural supply.” Strategy, which began accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, now holds 582,000 BTC—worth approximately $63.85 billion, according to Saylor Tracker. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn,” he noted. The billionaire also referenced broader market signals as validation for his aggressive forecast. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” Saylor said, pointing to traditional financial institutions preparing Bitcoin custody services and political support from key figures in Washington. BREAKING: BILLIONAIRE MICHAEL SAYLOR TELLS BLOOMBERG #BITCOIN IS GOING TO $1 MILLION AND THAT THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER CRYPTO WINTER COMPANIES AND ETFS ""ARE BUYING THE ENTIRE SUPPLY."" PARABOLIC SOON pic.twitter.com/Vv7qSRIgst — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) June 10, 2025 He cited President Donald Trump’s backing of Bitcoin, as well as support from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and SEC Chair Paul Atkins. “Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected,” Saylor said. Saylor did acknowledge potential volatility at higher price levels, stating that if Bitcoin rises to $500,000 or $1 million, it would be realistic to expect it “crashing down by about $200,000 a coin.” His remarks come as other major players revise their own projections upward. In April, ARK Invest raised its “bull case” price target for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. ETF Providers Continue to Accumulate Bitcoin Meanwhile, ETF providers such as BlackRock continue to purchase Bitcoin on a daily basis, and some governments are stepping in as well. On May 28, Pakistan’s crypto council head Bilal Bin Saqib announced plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Notably, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin continues to grow. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 116 public firms have now added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Recent additions include GameStop and Swedish health tech company H100. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

2025-06-11T07:07:29,"CONY: Earn Steady Monthly Income With This High Yielder","Summary CONY offers a high yield via monthly distributions, but its price has declined, leading to underperformance versus holding COIN directly. The ETF's distributions are classified as return of capital, offering tax deferral benefits until the fund is sold, which can appeal to long-term investors. Risks include declining distributions, potential for the fund price to approach zero, and uncertainty about sustaining high yields in the future. I rate CONY a 'hold'—it may be suitable for income-focused investors, but COIN offers higher total return potential for growth-oriented investors. This may not be for everyone, but the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) currently pays a 175% annual yield with distributions paid monthly. This fund can be a great way to collect monthly income with such a high yield. The fund doesn't invest directly in Coinbase ( COIN ). CONY generates income for distributions by writing (selling) call options on Coinbase. Since COIN tends to be a volatile stock, the premiums sold can be high from the elevated implied volatility of the call options. Some investors may prefer to do their own covered call strategy. However, CONY provides the convenience of having professionals manage those options regularly in exchange for a reasonable fee (expense ratio) of 1.22%. Investors of CONY buy the fund and then enjoy the high monthly distributions without much effort. The expense ratio looks reasonable considering the high annual yield that investors can derive from CONY. Understanding CONY's Performance Stock Performance of COIN vs. CONY (Weekly Chart) Including Dividends ( TradingView ) The weekly chart above shows the performance of COIN's stock price with a comparison to CONY's performance, including the distribution payouts. Even with CONY's generous monthly payouts, COIN still outperformed. The reason for this is because CONY's price declined significantly since inception. The YieldMax ETFs tend to underperform the underlying stocks that they derive income from. So, some investors may prefer to own COIN instead of CONY. In that scenario, COIN holders could sell some shares when income is needed. I will point out that Coinbase is currently in an uptrend on the weekly chart. This is indicated with the purple RSI line (middle of the chart) above the 50 level and the blue MACD line (bottom of the chart) above the red signal line. The MACD's green rising histogram bars also reinforce COIN's uptrend. Defenders of CONY may point out that they are happy with a lower total return with the consistent convenience of collecting monthly income from it. Defenders of holding COIN instead of CONY may say that they prefer the higher total return, especially when CONY's expense ratio adds to its total underperformance. The price of CONY declined over the long term since its inception. However, CONY's high yield allows investors to receive more in distributions than what they invested into it in a relatively short period of time. At the current yield, it would take less than a year. Therefore, CONY could lose all of its value and investors could still be profitable from the high distributions. Of course, this assumes that YieldMax is consistently successful with producing strong income. CONY's Tax Benefit Another plus for CONY is that the distributions are taxed differently than regular dividends. Since income from CONY is essentially options income, it is considered return of capital when paid out. The return of capital reduces the adjusted cost basis. According to IRS rules , return of capital is not taxed in the year that you receive the income. It would only be taxed when the ETF is sold. Therefore, a long-term holder of the fund could enjoy multiple years of income from CONY without being taxed on it if they choose not to sell. It is important to note that if the price of CONY went to zero, future distributions would be taxed in the year that you receive them. It is possible that the fund would do a reverse split if the price approached zero. This would allow the fund to continue and for YieldMax to continue paying distributions. Distribution Payout History CONY's Distribution Payout History (Seeking Alpha) We can see from the table above that 2025 was the first year that the monthly distributions dropped below $1 per share. This is relative to the price of CONY. For example, back on December 7, 2023, the distribution of $2.4615 was a monthly yield of 10.7% based on CONY's price on that day of $23.04. Recently, on May 29, 2025, the distribution of $0.7351 was a monthly yield of 9.5% based on CONY's price of $7.75 on that day. While the monthly yield did drop, it didn't drop as drastically as the percentage change of the distribution payout. Investors can purchase more shares as CONY's price drops, which can increase their monthly returns. That can include reinvesting some of the distributions to purchase more shares. Risks for CONY I realize that it sounds cliche, but there is no guarantee that future results will be similar to the past. It is possible that YieldMax is not able to produce high distributions going forward the way they did in the past. The implied volatility of the options sold could change, which could produce different results for distribution payouts. CONY's underlying price could continue to drop and approach zero. So, investors need to realize that the distributions are what can make them money from this ETF. YieldMax would probably do a reverse split to increase the price of CONY if it dropped too low. YieldMax did a reverse split on TSLY back in February 2024. It is also possible that the monthly distributions are lowered significantly, making the total annual yield less attractive. This could also significantly increase the amount of time that it would take for investors to make back their initial investment in distributions. Final Thoughts on CONY I see CONY fit for investors who desire steady monthly payouts. Personally, I would strive to get the highest return on my money as possible. That means that I would prefer to own COIN, which tends to have a higher total return even when CONY's dividends are accounted for. Those who prefer COIN should keep an eye on Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) bull markets. The reason for this is because COIN tends to trend similar to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's bear markets can be brutal, and the same is true for COIN. CONY began trading in 2023. So, it hasn't been around during Bitcoin's last halving cycle. It is possible that CONY's opposite, the YieldMax Short COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( FIAT ) would be better to own after Bitcoin and COIN peak this cycle. However, there is not much history to gauge how CONY and FIAT would perform during a Bitcoin bear market. Overall, I'll rate CONY a 'hold' since it can act as a feasible way for investors to collect income on a monthly basis. I won't give it a higher rating because CONY's success depends on the skills of the fund managers. Plus, there is not much history for this ETF since it is only a couple of years old.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793934-cony-earn-steady-monthly-income-with-this-high-yielder?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","COIN|CONY",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T07:06:57,"Connecticut Passes Bill to Ban State Investment in Bitcoin – Here’s What to Know","The US state of Connecticut has passed a law that prohibits the state from investing in digital assets. The new legislation has also barred the state government from creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The bill, H.B. 7082, published by the Connecticut General Assembly on Tuesday, was anonymously approved by both the state House of Representatives and the Senate, with no opposing votes. Further, the legislation has updated the state’s money transmission laws, with a major focus on crypto regulation. Crypto businesses engaging in money transmissions should disclose all material risks associated with crypto, the new law reads. NEW: Connecticut passes law to ban state investment in bitcoin. HB7082 prohibits the state from accepting, holding, or investing in any virtual currencies. It also imposes several new requirements on money transmitters. pic.twitter.com/lKozljMp1R — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 10, 2025 Connecticut’s legislative action is part of a broader effort to regulate state-level crypto activities and make sure that public funds are protected from the risks associated with these speculative investments. Additionally, the bill mandates legal guardian verification for users under the age of 18, imposing protections for minors. Connecticut Falls Out of Bitcoin Reserve Race Following months of strategic Bitcoin reserve proposals from 27 states, New Hampshire , Arizona , and Texas have approved state-level Bitcoin reserve law. For instance, Texas has a “significant budget surplus” and a strategic Bitcoin reserve in that state “offers a forward-thinking investment opportunity,” Lee Bratcher, President of The Texas Blockchain Council, told Cryptonews . “Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value aligns with our state’s history of making smart, diversified investments in emerging assets,” he said at the time. However, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation this year, joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. The hesitance to embrace BTC comes amid concerns over its price volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve , a significant move, but, didn’t have concrete details, failing to excite traders.

2025-06-11T07:04:05,"Crypto Analyst Predicts ‘Really Epic’ Next Few Months for Bitcoin, Sees Vertical Phase Coming for BTC","An analyst known for making timely Bitcoin calls believes that BTC is poised to witness steep rallies in the coming months. In a new video, trader Kevin Svenson tells his 83,200 YouTube followers that Bitcoin appears to be in the final stages of a parabolic trend that began in 2023. According to Svenson, Bitcoin could ignite a fresh leg up once it takes out its final resistance area at around $110,000. “It’s going to be a really epic next few months if we do get this breakout, because we are still following the parabolic trend to this day.” Svenson believes that a breakout will trigger a “blow-off top” for Bitcoin, where BTC will experience a period of rapid price increases before collapsing. “The next phase is the vertical phase, where you go into a potential blow-off top. A parabola is simply just an exponential trend and it gets steeper and steeper. And because of that, by definition, the parabolic trend it’s unsustainable… It’s a trade-off: it gets really, really bullish, and because of that, it’s unsustainable. Eventually, the trend just gives out just like Bitcoin in 2017, 2021. Eventually, the trend will shift back… But this next push could be until October.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will soar to $135,000 in the coming months. At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $110,085.

With Bitcoin prices surging and institutional demand booming, IBIT is now one of the fastest-growing ETFs in U.S. history. But how did it beat gold and S&P 500 ETFs to this record, and what does it mean for Bitcoin’s future on Wall Street? Let’s break down! $336 Million in a Single Day On June 10, BlackRock added 3,005 more Bitcoins to its ETF portfolio, worth about $336 million, bringing its total holdings to a staggering 662,571 BTC. This pushed its total assets under management (AUM) to $72.7 billion. The numbers are impressive, but what really stands out is the speed of this growth. IBIT reached the $70 billion mark in just 341 trading days, faster than any other ETF in history. According to ETF expert Eric Balchunas , no other ETF in U.S. history has grown this fast. To put this in perspective, the popular SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) took almost 5x times longer to reach the same milestone. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoin ETF Summer: Solana and Litecoin Top ETF Approval List, XRP Holds Strong at 85% , Strong Demand From Big Investors IBIT launched in the U.S. in January 2024 and has already attracted nearly $50 billion in inflows. That’s more than any of the other 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs that launched at the same time. Even with a big outflow of $430.8 million in May, IBIT has bounced back strong, riding the wave of Bitcoin’s price surge past $111K. Although the excitement isn’t just about IBIT. Altogether, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are on the verge of hitting a staggering $1 trillion in trading volume, an incredible leap from $100 billion just a few months ago. IBIT Share Hit All-Time High Meanwhile, the growing IBIT share price also hit a new peak of $63 , offering investors returns of around 150% since the fund launched in January 2024.

2025-06-11T06:23:44,"Ether, Dogecoin Surge, Outpaces Bitcoin as DeFi Comments Spurs Bullish Mood","Bitcoin BTC stayed steady above $109,500 in Asian morning hours Wednesday, a rebound that started after last week’s profit-taking. However, all eyes are on ether ETH with traders commenting on upside volatility in the weeks to come and reporting record volumes for certain ETH-based products on some exchanges. ETH zoomed 5% in the past 24 hours, leading gains among majors. “Investors are finally recognizing the compelling investment opportunity that Ethereum presents. It’s still trading well below its all-time highs, while bitcoin is already near its ATH levels,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a message to CoinDesk. He pointed to Ethereum's growing role in tokenizing real-world assets like stocks, money-market funds, and U.S. Treasuries, adding that it was “very likely that Ethereum will reach and/or surpass its all-time high price by the end of the year.” Ether ETFs have attracted more than $800 million in the past two weeks alone, outpacing bitcoin’s sub-$400 million, according to SoSoValue data. That’s helped the spread between ether’s implied volatility and bitcoin’s reach its highest level since late 2022 — a sign traders expect bigger price swings ahead. Open interest in ether perpetuals on Kraken hit an all-time high of 30,000 ETH this week, said Alexia Theodorou, Head of Derivatives at Kraken, in an email to CoinDesk. “This signals a notable uptick in speculative activity around the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap,” she noted. However, she cautioned that the market “has yet to form a clear directional consensus,” with the long/short ratio still well below January levels. Elsewhere in the market, Solana SOL and Cardano ADA posted gains of 4.7% and 3.3%, respectively, adding to the risk-on tone, while XRP XRP rose 2% to $2.30. Ethereum beta bet dogecoin DOGE climbed 3.7% to reverse all of last week’s losses.

2025-06-11T06:20:15,"US Stock Market Rallies: S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Close Higher","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Rallies: S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Close Higher While the spotlight in our corner of the financial world often shines brightest on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the dynamic crypto landscape, keeping an eye on traditional markets like the US stock market is crucial. Why? Because these giants of finance can often provide valuable context for broader investor sentiment, economic health indicators, and even regulatory winds that might eventually blow towards digital assets. Today, the news from Wall Street brings a decidedly positive note: the major indices finished the trading session firmly in the green, signaling a potential boost in market confidence. What Drove the Latest US Stock Market Gains? The market’s performance is rarely dictated by a single factor. Several elements typically converge to push indices higher or lower on any given day. While the specific catalysts for today’s climb weren’t detailed in the initial report, general drivers often include positive economic data releases, strong corporate earnings reports, shifts in interest rate expectations from the Federal Reserve, or even geopolitical developments that are viewed favorably by investors. A positive feedback loop can also occur, where initial buying momentum encourages further investment, fueling a broader market rally . Understanding these drivers helps investors, including those focused on crypto, gauge the overall risk appetite in the global financial system. When traditional markets show strength, it can sometimes indicate a willingness among investors to take on more risk, which can occasionally spill over into alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, weakness in stocks can sometimes signal caution, leading to risk-off sentiment across various asset classes. Breaking Down the Numbers: S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Let’s look at the specific performance of the three benchmark indices that represent different facets of the US stock market : S&P 500 : This index is widely considered the best gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. It tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Today, it posted a gain of +0.55%. This move reflects positive sentiment across a broad range of leading American companies. Nasdaq Composite : Known for its heavy weighting in technology and growth stocks, the Nasdaq index saw the strongest percentage gain among the three, closing up +0.66%. This performance often indicates strength in the tech sector, which has been a significant driver of market performance in recent years. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) : The Dow Jones is a price-weighted index tracking 30 large, publicly owned companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Often seen as a barometer for the health of traditional industrial America, it added +0.25% today. While a more modest gain than the Nasdaq, it still signifies participation from established, large-cap companies in the day’s positive movement. Here’s a quick summary of today’s closing figures: Index Daily Change S&P 500 +0.55% Nasdaq +0.66% Dow Jones +0.25% What Does This Market Rally Mean for Investors? A day of gains in the US stock market , particularly across the major indices, can bolster investor confidence. For stock investors, it’s a positive signal, reinforcing the potential for continued growth. For those primarily invested in cryptocurrency, observing this trend provides valuable context. While crypto markets operate 24/7 and are influenced by their own unique factors, including technological developments, regulatory news specific to digital assets, and network effects, they don’t exist in a vacuum. The performance of traditional assets like those tracked by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can influence overall market sentiment and capital flows. Potential Benefits of a Strong Stock Market: Increased Investor Confidence: Positive momentum can encourage more participation in financial markets generally. Wealth Effect: As stock portfolios grow, individuals may feel wealthier and potentially more inclined to invest in other assets, including crypto. Positive Economic Signal: A rising stock market is often seen as a forward-looking indicator of economic health, suggesting potential for future growth. Challenges and Considerations: Correlation vs. Causation: It’s important not to assume a direct, one-to-one correlation between stock market moves and crypto prices. Crypto has its own dynamics. Volatility Remains: Both stock and crypto markets are subject to volatility. A single day’s gain doesn’t guarantee future performance. Differing Fundamentals: The fundamental drivers of stock value (earnings, growth potential, dividends) are different from those driving crypto value (network adoption, technology development, scarcity, decentralization). Actionable Insights for the Informed Investor Whether your primary focus is stocks, crypto, or a diversified portfolio, staying informed is key. Today’s positive close in the US stock market serves as a reminder that the broader financial ecosystem is constantly moving. Use this information as part of your overall market awareness, but always conduct your own research specific to the assets you hold or plan to invest in. Consider how broader economic trends and investor sentiment, as reflected in traditional markets like the Dow Jones , might indirectly influence the regulatory environment or the entry of institutional capital into the crypto space. While the day-to-day correlation can be debated, the long-term interconnectedness of global finance is undeniable. Conclusion: A Positive Signal in the Broader Financial Landscape The closing bell today delivered good news for investors in the traditional financial markets, with the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones all recording solid gains. This positive momentum contributes to a narrative of cautious optimism in the US stock market . For those navigating the exciting world of cryptocurrency, this news offers valuable context on the prevailing sentiment in traditional finance – a sentiment that, while not always directly dictating crypto prices, remains a significant piece of the global economic puzzle.

2025-06-11T06:16:19,"Trump Backed Bitcoin Miner Quietly Builds BTC Reserve","Unlike many miners, ABTC’s strategy focuses on growing its Bitcoin reserves rather than just mining profits. Its miners include over 60,000 units hosted by Hut 8 in North America, and they deliver over 10 EH/s in hashrate. The firm holds its BTC with Coinbase Custody and plans to merge with Gryphon Digital Mining, with Eric Trump joining the board post-merger. Meanwhile, Bitcoin adoption by corporations is growing, and Michael Saylor even recently urged Apple to buy BTC instead of pursuing more stock buybacks. Global momentum is also building as GameStop, Metaplanet, and The Blockchain Group are all increasing Bitcoin reserves. Additionally, the Bank of Japan’s June 16–17 meeting could spur a Bitcoin rally if the central bank pivots back to QE. Trump Mining Firm Stacks Bitcoin American Bitcoin, the mining firm backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., quietly amassed a reserve of 215 Bitcoin since launching on April 1. This is according to a recent SEC filing . The company has made it clear that its core strategy centers on accumulating Bitcoin rather than treating it as a byproduct of mining. The stache is currently worth over $23 million, but was not previously disclosed. ABTC described its reserve as a strategic asset which goal is to enhance long-term shareholder value, with no fixed accumulation target in place. Instead, the company said it plans to continually evaluate market conditions to opportunistically raise capital and expand its holdings. Rather than owning physical infrastructure, ABTC directly invests in mining hardware. The firm operates more than 60,000 miners, primarily from Bitmain and MicroBT, which are hosted at facilities in New York, Alberta, and Texas managed by Hut 8 . These miners collectively generate a hashrate of 10.17 exahashes per second, with energy efficiency averaging 21.2 joules per terahash. By partnering with Hut 8, ABTC kept overhead costs low while maintaining the flexibility to scale production. The firm also contributes to mining pools like Foundry and Luxor, with rewards distributed according to hashrate contributions and pool fees kept below 1%. (Source: SEC filing ) ABTC follows a three-tiered approach: building cost-effective mining operations, expanding its Bitcoin reserves through strategic capital use, and engaging actively with the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. The firm’s Bitcoin is held securely in cold wallets with Coinbase Custody, and uses multifactor authentication and strict withdrawal protocols to safeguard assets. On May 12, ABTC revealed plans to go public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The transaction will be structured as a stock-for-stock deal, and will result in the combined entity operating under the American Bitcoin name. Eric Trump is set to join the board post-merger, while Hut 8, the majority shareholder, will maintain its role in managing infrastructure and operations. Once completed, current ABTC shareholders will own about 98% of the new company. Saylor Tells Apple to Buy Bitcoin Other companies are also being encouraged to embrace Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, urged Apple to consider buying Bitcoin as a strategic alternative to its underperforming stock buyback program. In a June 10 post on X , Saylor responded to CNBC host Jim Cramer’s critique of Apple’s buyback initiative, which was described as ineffective despite a $110 billion allocation disclosed in a May 2024 SEC filing. Cramer suggested the company reevaluate its approach because relying solely on buybacks may no longer be viable. Saylor’s suggestion is grounded in Bitcoin’s very impressive historical performance. While Apple shares climbed 137% over the past five years, Bitcoin soared more than 1,000%. Bitcoin also climbed 17% since the start of the year, while Apple faced an almost 17% drop. The implication is that a Bitcoin allocation could serve as a much better vehicle for shareholder value appreciation than continued stock repurchases. Apple YTD share price (Source: Google ) This call happened during a broader wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption. GameStop recently disclosed a $513 million Bitcoin purchase, and bought 4,710 BTC after a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. In Asia, Metaplanet has become the eighth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with its stock rising by more than 12% after announcing a $5.4 billion capital raise to expand its BTC holdings even more. Across Europe, Paris-based The Blockchain Group is planning to raise over $340 million for its Bitcoin treasury, shortly after acquiring $68 million worth of BTC. Bitcoin’s growing appeal to corporations is also encouraged by a rebound in spot Bitcoin ETF flows. After a brief two-day dip, funds recorded over $386 million in net inflows on June 9, which could mean that there is renewed institutional interest. Saylor’s suggestion that Apple follow suit taps into this momentum, as Bitcoin continues to stand out as a serious asset for corporate treasuries looking for long-term growth and diversification. BOJ Pivot Could Boost Bitcoin Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan’s upcoming monetary policy meeting on June 16–17 is being closely watched as a potential turning point for global risk assets, including Bitcoin and equities. Market participants, including BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, believe the central bank could reintroduce quantitative easing (QE) measures and reverse its tightening stance. Hayes suggested in a June 10 post on X that if the BOJ delays its current quantitative tightening (QT) program and resumes targeted QE, it could trigger a rally in risk assets like Bitcoin. QE is a monetary policy tool that is used to inject liquidity into the economy through large-scale bond purchases. It tends to lower interest rates and fuel asset prices during economic uncertainty. Back in July of 2024, the Bank of Japan announced a plan to reduce its government bond purchases by 400 billion yen per quarter starting in August. This started a shift toward QT after years of ultra-loose monetary policy. However, sources that were referred to by Bloomberg indicate that the BOJ is now considering a more gradual reduction, with a revised plan to cut only 200 billion yen per quarter beginning in 2027. The central bank’s June meeting includes an interim assessment of this tightening program, making it a critical juncture for possible policy shifts. Bitcoin’s sensitivity to developments in Japan’s bond market became evident in May 2025, when the cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high of $112,000 just two days after 30-year Japanese bond yields spiked to a record 3.185%. The yield surge caused fears about Japan’s fiscal stability, which pushed investors to seek alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. According to André Dragosch , head of European research at Bitwise, these concerns about sovereign default risks strengthened the perception of Bitcoin as a hedge free from counterparty risk. As traditional safe-haven assets like government bonds become more volatile, Bitcoin’s role as a macro hedge is gaining more and more traction.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9520/trump-backed-bitcoin-miner-quietly-builds-btc-reserve,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T06:10:22,"Bitcoin Climbs Above $110K Amid Rising Derivatives Activity and Leverage Signals","Bitcoin soared almost 3.5% in the past day, breaking through the $110,000 threshold for the first time in many weeks and touching what seems to be a recent high of $110.3K (chart via TradingView). Of course, any Bitcoin rally is going to be very closely watched by not only investors but also many analysts trying to get a read on what might be happening in the more speculative corners of the crypto market. So, this rally is already under the microscope, and what we’re seeing is this: the signal we’re getting from the derivatives market is decidedly mixed. Even while Bitcoin’s spot price keeps surging in the wake of overall crypto market enthusiasm, the structure underlying the asset’s market tells a more complicated story. Data from on-chain and exchanges over the last day illuminate something that a lot of people who’ve been in crypto for any length of time have gotten used to: the reality that Bitcoin is back in the uptrend, again. Being in the uptrend is kind of comforting; it breaks my heart that so much of that comfort is built on the rise of gaze-based financial products. Spike in Short Liquidations Accompanies Price Rally One of the recent surge’s primary possible causes seems to be a sudden increase in the number of short positions being liquidated. Yesterday, Bitcoin futures short liquidations hit $5.74 million in a single day. This unwind of forced bearish bets added a lot of push to Bitcoin’s price. And as a result, we accelerated our way up to $110.3K. The 24-hour simple moving average (SMA) for short liquidations is currently at $768,252.14, indicating that the recent spike is above the norm by a wide margin. This is taken to suggest that there is a rush on to exit short positions, with traders in that camp quite apparently caught off-guard by a rapid upward price shift. Liquidations of this scale usually stoke short-term volatility, with the positions getting sold off at the market price coming right back into play. It’s sort of a “you kick, I kick” arrangement that can keep the market moving upward for a while and can even make it seem, to some, that we are in a bull market. But this reinflux of pieces that have been forced to the market can make the situation pretty fragile, especially if too many new long positions are being taken and not enough old ones are being reactivated. Long-Side Premiums and Open Interest Continue to Rise Concurrently, the premium for long positions has surged significantly over the past 12 hours, now standing at $270,480. This fact implies that traders are more and more keen to shell out a premium for the privilege of staying long, even as prices continue to move upward. In other words, paying a premium to be long is no longer an exclusive club—it’s something more and more traders are opting to do. Believe it or not, this is actually a good sign. It points yet again to the ever-increasing bullishness of the market. #Bitcoin price rose nearly 3.5% in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of $110.3K. Derivatives suggest potential overheating (rising short liquidations, increasing long-side premium, and growing open interest). However, funding rate uptick is only modest — glassnode (@glassnode) June 10, 2025 Total number of outstanding derivative contracts—open interest—has also increased in tandem, signaling that new capital is entering the market. Rising open interest can be a healthy sign of growing participation, but when combined with surging long premiums and liquidations, it may indicate a leverage build-up that could precipitate an instability event. Some risk indicators, however, do remain in check. One closely watched metric for evaluating whether overheating is occurring in the crypto derivatives space is the funding rate for perpetual futures contracts. This rate reflects the cost of holding a position and often spikes when leverage is extremely skewed. Funding Rates Still Moderate Despite Leverage Buildup Funding rate data, interestingly, suggests that while the market is clearly speculative, it hasn’t yet reached extreme levels. Across major exchanges, the perpetual futures funding rate for Bitcoin currently ranges from a low of 0.0003% to a high of 0.023%, with an average around 0.0016%. These values are higher than neutral but still well below the excessive levels that have historically preceded sharp reversals. The uptick we see here in funding is very modest, so what we’re signaling is that interest in holding long positions is growing, but still, traders aren’t being incentivized by upticks in funding to pay obnoxious carry rates to hold onto those long positions. That’s kind of a key distinction. The lack of exorbitant carry rates signals that we might have a bit more room to run before traders are forced to price in the interest mechanism if we keep going up. The present state is a classic crypto conundrum: although there is unmistakable momentum and enthusiasm behind the recent rally in Bitcoin, the data purportedly points to growing leverage and, uh, speculative bets that may need to be unwound. Without extreme funding rates or blowout open interest, though, the market looks to be in a heightened but not dangerously overheated state. Volatility spikes, long liquidations, and sudden changes in funding rates will be closely monitored by traders and analysts. Bitcoin, in the meantime, is trying to hold above a price point of $110,000. On a consolidated basis, it will start sending clearer signals regarding the persistence of its ongoing upward movement.

2025-06-11T06:10:13,"Crypto-linked suspicious transactions hit record high in Germany","Germany’s Financial Intelligence Unit reported a record surge in suspicious activity reports tied to cryptocurrencies last year, even as overall SAR filings declined. In its annual report released Tuesday in Cologne, the FIU stated that 8,711 crypto-related notifications were submitted in 2024 — marking an 8.2% increase from the previous year, Bloomberg reported . This occurred despite the total number of SARs dropping after the agency issued new guidance aimed at reducing irrelevant reports. The majority of the flagged transactions involved Bitcoin ( BTC ), followed by Ethereum ( ETH ), Tether ( USDT ), and Litecoin ( LTC ). These tokens were frequently linked to activity on trading platforms, mixing services , or online gambling. The FIU noted that these types of transactions are commonly used to obscure the origins of illicit funds, underscoring the increasing role of digital assets in money laundering schemes. You might also like: While crypto is gradually getting legalized, its money laundering use persists — what are the trends? Internationally, Germany’s trend mirrors growing concerns over the criminal use of cryptocurrencies. In the UK, the National Crime Agency reported that crypto exchanges were tied to 6.6% of all SARs in the 2023–24 period, as total filings rose slightly to approximately 872,000. The UK also noted a sharp increase in counter- terrorism financing reports and account-freezing actions. In the U.S., FinCEN received over 8,600 crypto-linked SARs in fiscal year 2023, a jump driven by a specific advisory issued in September that led to weekly filings spiking as high as 1,560. Overall, U.S. entities filed 4.6 million SARs during the year. Globally, the scale of crypto-related money laundering is also substantial. Chainalysis data shows laundered crypto volumes reached $31.5 billion in 2022 before falling to $22.2 billion in 2023 — though still well above pre-2021 levels. Chainalysis noted that in 2023, the overall crypto transaction volume declined by 15%, but the laundered crypto volume decreased by approximately 30%. It’s hard to say if there was a positive change since the total criminal use of crypto was more or less stable at around $50 billion per year in 2022, 2023, and 2024, according to Chainalaysis.

Between May 3 and June 10, the company acquired 4,710 Bitcoin in cash, a move that follows a March decision by its board to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The announcement came alongside disappointing first-quarter results that saw revenue fall 17% to $732.4m, down from $881.8m a year earlier. Shares slid 4.6% in after-hours trading.

It’ll be recognized in Q2 FY2025. No Bitcoin on the Balance Sheet. pic.twitter.com/IEA9X7ZISM — Han Akamatsu 赤松 (@Han_Akamatsu) June 10, 2025 Sales in its hardware and accessories segment, which includes new and pre-owned games, dropped 32%. Despite efforts to expand its e-commerce presence and digital offerings, the company has yet to offset the ongoing decline in brick-and-mortar sales meaningfully. Bitcoin Joins GameStop’s Long-Term Asset Playbook This is not GameStop’s first crypto experiment. In 2022, it launched a digital wallet aimed at tapping into the Web3 trend but shuttered the project a year later, citing regulatory uncertainty. Its latest foray, however, positions Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. In a statement, GameStop said it may use part of its cash reserves or proceeds from future debt or equity sales to expand its Bitcoin holdings. The move mirrors the high-profile strategy of MicroStrategy, which has famously accumulated large amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. More than 80 public companies have followed suit, including Trump Media. Crypto Pivot Highlights GameStop’s Struggle To Evolve GameStop’s embrace of Bitcoin appears to be both a financial bet and a signal to its retail investor base, which has historically shown strong interest in crypto-related plays. Yet, the market’s response has been cautious. GameStop’s stock fell nearly 20% in the days following the disclosure, suggesting skepticism among investors. While some view the Bitcoin purchase as a distraction from operational headwinds, others see it as a bold attempt to reposition the company as digital-first, even as the broader industry transitions to streaming and downloadable content. With national retailers shuttering stores and physical game sales declining, GameStop’s bet on Bitcoin may offer some financial diversification. Whether it can also help reverse its fortunes remains far less certain.

2025-06-11T06:08:44,"Bitcoin Needs to Hold Critical Threshold for Analyst’s ‘More Room to Run’ Scenario","Bitcoin’s (BTC) rise above $109,000 provided momentum to the stagnant cryptocurrency market. This upward movement was a welcome respite following last week’s Trump-Musk public spat that briefly dragged the top crypto asset close to $100,000. A market expert believes that the current rally “may have more room to run.” Bullish Trend Remains Intact Bitcoin has broken above its short-term downtrend after completing a bullish breakout from a consolidating triangle pattern typically associated with trend continuation. Prominent crypto analyst Markus Thielen noted that while he initially anticipated a quieter summer trading period, the strength of the current move suggests fresh capital is driving the rally as tariff concerns diminish. In the latest edition of Matrixport analysis , Thielen pointed to steady momentum despite expected upward pressure in this week’s Consumer Price Index data, which is considered unlikely to halt Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Markets have simultaneously reduced expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year to just one, reflecting a more resilient US economy than previously forecasted. Thielen added that Bitcoin’s bullish trend remains intact, provided the cryptocurrency maintains levels above $105,075. This price point will now act as a critical technical threshold for continued upward movement. Reduced Selling Pressure Supporting this technical outlook, on-chain data provides additional evidence for the rally’s sustainability. According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, realized profit from long-term Bitcoin holders has experienced a dramatic decline, falling 89% from approximately $126 million to $13.6 million based on 24-hour simple moving averages. The data reveals that despite Bitcoin trading at similar price levels to the late-May peak, seasoned investors who have held their positions for over one year are demonstrating significantly reduced profit-taking activity. This sharp reduction in selling pressure from experienced holders suggests that this cohort of investors appears more reluctant to realize gains at current price levels compared to their activity during the previous rally period.

Myria ( MYRIA ), the native token of the Ethereum-based Layer-2 gaming platform, emerged as one of the top gainers during the latest crypto market uptick, soaring by 50% yesterday and up 5% in the past 24 hours.

MYRIA’s price chart |Source: TradingView The rally was fueled by a sharp rise in trading activity. MYRIA’s 24-hour volume spiked by over 360%, propelling its market capitalization to approximately $59.5 million. The performance positioned MYRIA as a top-performing crypto asset, behind only a few others like PAYCOIN, which gained over 100%. However, the token soon began relinquishing its gains in an inability to maintain the positive momentum, losing nearly 20% of its gains within a brief period.

Noting the positive approach of cabinet members, former SEC officials and CFTC representatives towards digital assets, Saylor said, “Now banks will also store Bitcoin.” Related News: BREAKING: Rumors of Solana Spot ETF Approval Emerge, Could Stir Up the Market - Price Reacts Saylor also said that the supply of Bitcoin has become limited, and that only 450 Bitcoins are sold by miners per day, which corresponds to a daily sales volume of approximately $50 million. According to Saylor, this volume is enough for the market to move upwards: “Companies that hold Bitcoin treasuries are buying the daily natural supply alone. BlackRock and ETFs are also buying. Moreover, even governments are now entering this space.” Saylor said that when the price of Bitcoin reaches $500,000 or $1 million, a drop may be possible, but such a scenario is not possible at current price levels. He cited Trump Media’s $2.5 billion announcement, GameStop’s $500 million move and MicroStrategy’s multi-billion-dollar new fundraising as examples. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T06:02:41,"SUI eyes breakout as Nasdaq files to list 21Shares SUI ETF","Sui is recovering from consolidation as developments around exchange-traded funds fuel fresh momentum. At press time, Sui ( SUI ) is trading at $3.46, up 2.1% in the past 24 hours and rebounding from a weekly low of $2.92 on June 6. The dip had been driven by market fallout from the Cetus ( CETUS ) hack and broader macroeconomic pressures. SUI’s recovery, however, might be aided by fresh institutional momentum. With a 24-hour trading volume of $1.01 billion, up 300% from the day before, SUI’s market activity has significantly increased. As per Coinglass data , SUI’s derivatives volume rose 6.44% to $5.16 billion, while open interest climbed 3.53% to $1.52 billion, a sign that more traders are taking leveraged positions and expecting near-term volatility or movement. The surge coincides with a major development. According to a June 10 announcement by the Sui Foundation, Nasdaq has filed a 19b-4 with the SEC to list the 21Shares SUI ETF, officially kicking off the regulatory review process for a U.S. spot ETF based on the SUI token. You might also like: Sui rallies past $1.75B TVL as bitcoin and stablecoin flows spike The filing follows 21Shares’ April S-1 registration and builds on the firm’s SUI exchange-traded product listings already live on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. “The milestone of a Nasdaq filing is a powerful moment,” said Kevin Boon, President of Mysten Labs. “We’re proud to help 21Shares build toward a world where every investor can access SUI.” Over $300 million is already invested in SUI-based ETPs globally. Institutional firms such as Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Grayscale have launched products on Sui since late 2024, reflecting its appeal as a high-performance Layer 1 chain. Looking at the technical picture, SUI appears to be eyeing a breakout from consolidation. Bollinger Bands are beginning to tighten, and price action is hovering near the middle band at $3.38. At 52.5, the relative strength index confirms a neutral bias but still has room to rise before reaching overbought territory. SUI price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The MACD’s entry into positive territory could be a potential early indicator of bullish momentum. Although it’s still negative, the awesome oscillator is flattening, indicating a possible change in momentum. The estimated moving averages from 10 to 200 days are flashing buy, but the 30- and 50-day simple moving averages exhibit a slight bearish lag. If the price manages to close above $3.50 with confirmation through rising volume, SUI could test the previous local high near $3.80, and possibly push toward $4.20 if ETF optimism holds. Failure to break above resistance, however, could see SUI drift back to $3.20–$3.00 support, especially if broader risk sentiment weakens.

2025-06-11T06:01:16,"Starknet to launch STRK staking v2 on mainnet on June 17","Staring June 17, Starknet will launch STRK Staking v2, the next stage of its staking program, on the mainnet, introducing new performance and incentive systems for delegators and validators. The upgrade was announced on June 10 via Starknet’s ( STRK ) official X account. Staking v2 introduces block attestation and commission adjustments, two major features that will improve validator reliability and reward fairness. Under block attestation, validators must confirm randomly chosen blocks in each epoch to prove they’re online and tracking the network. Those who fail to do so will not receive rewards, and their delegators lose out as well. This ensures validators are active and prepares them for future consensus responsibilities expected by the end of 2025. https://twitter.com/starknet/status/1932509308673274394?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw The second key feature changes how validator commissions work. Under the new system, validators can commit to a maximum commission cap for a set period, up to one year. Although they are free to reduce fees whenever they want, they are unable to raise them above the stated cap until the commitment period is over. You might also like: Starknet launches Asset Runes to bring USDC and other tokens to Bitcoin During the upgrade, Starknet will temporarily pause staking contracts to facilitate a smooth transition. Delegators don’t need to do anything, but once Staking v2 goes live, they’ll be able to view validator performance data and switch validators at any time without delay. This marks the second phase of Starknet’s staking rollout. The first phase began in November 2024, allowing users with at least 20,000 STRK to stake and earn rewards. Full validator consensus will be introduced in a third phase scheduled for late 2025. The upgrade arrives alongside several major ecosystem developments, including Ethereum ( ETH ) Virtual Machine wallet support and a custom Bitcoin ( BTC ) bridge expected by the end of Q2. Bitcoin staking is also set to launch later this year. By upgrading its staking system while live, Starknet is one of the first Layer 2 networks to shift validator responsibilities toward greater decentralization. These changes support its push toward “Stage 1” decentralization, reducing dependence on centralized sequencers while improving network security, transparency, and fairness.

2025-06-11T04:32:43,"ETH Technical Analysis as ETH Futures Conquers $2800","<p>Ethereum (ETH) Futures: Comprehensive Analysis & Institutional Bullish Signals</p><p>The past weeks have seen Ethereum (ETH) futures steadily gaining momentum, marked by increasing trading volumes and institutional inflows. The evolving landscape of Ethereum ETFs further supports a bullish short-term narrative, driving increased optimism among crypto traders and investors. This article provides a detailed technical and fundamental overview of ETH futures, enriched by institutional data and a strategic technical analysis.</p><p>Technical Analysis Video Transcript:</p><p>I present the bigger picture of where ETH futures is at, and the next targets above the current price, that I am looking at, in this ETH futures technical analysis video.</p><p>We notice an important purple channel shown in the video. I expect Ether to cross upward again, creating another touchpoint on the red resistance and breaking out above.</p><p>From the volume profile analysis and other methodologies from tradeCompass at ForexLive.com and investingLive.com, the next key price targets I anticipate are $2,882, and possibly - $2,920, and $2,967. Reaching the second target (around 2,920) implies another approximate 4% move, offering an attractive opportunity for day traders and short-term swing traders.</p><p>However, we might see a scenario where Ether revisits either the upper boundary of the purple channel or even retests the red line around 2,825. These specific figures require referencing additional charts, but the current orientation shows bulls firmly maintaining control. Personally, I would not choose to short here, expecting a decline.</p><p>Sophisticated traders are likely to take profits into liquidity spikes, with a minimum upside target near $2,880.</p><p>Please trade ETH and other crypto assets at your own risk only. This is not financial advice. </p><p>Importantly, if we observe two consecutive bearish daily candles, each clearly closing below the aforementioned resistance, this would challenge the current bullish bias and could hand control back to bears. Lastly, beware of fake-outs on lower timeframes.</p><p>Institutional Support and ETF Inflows:</p><p>Recent institutional data strongly underpins Ethereum’s bullish outlook. Notably, on June 10, Ethereum Spot ETFs witnessed a significant net inflow of $125 million, prominently driven by major asset managers:</p><ul><li><p>Blackrock: $80.60M</p></li><li><p>Fidelity: $26.30M</p></li><li><p>Bitwise: $8.40M</p></li><li><p>Grayscale: $9.70M</p></li></ul><p>This robust institutional participation highlights strategic accumulation and bullish sentiment among major players, indicating that smart money continues to favor Ethereum.</p><p>Volume Shift ETH vs. BTC:</p><p>A critical volume shift further cements ETH’s bullish momentum. Ethereum's trading volume increased dramatically by approximately $29.60 billion within a 24-hour timeframe, contrasting starkly with Bitcoin’s volume drop of $28.31 billion. This divergence demonstrates a clear investor shift, possibly indicating a rotation away from Bitcoin toward Ethereum, potentially driven by fundamental developments or favorable sentiment towards ETH’s utility and upcoming network improvements.</p><p>ETH Futures Market Data:</p><ul><li><p>Current ETH Futures Price: $2,806.5</p></li><li><p>Daily Range: $2,785.0 - $2,845.5</p></li><li><p>52-week Range: $1,387.0 - $4,142.5</p></li><li><p>Volume & Open Interest:</p><ul><li><p>Volume: 1.63K contracts (moderate liquidity)</p></li><li><p>Open Interest: 15.47K contracts (significant institutional presence)</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Performance indicators remain strong:</p><ul><li><p>Weekly (1W): +6.95%</p></li><li><p>Monthly (1M): +10.66%</p></li><li><p>Quarterly (3M): +46.84%</p></li></ul><p>These indicators highlight a robust short-term recovery and bullish momentum in Ethereum futures.</p><p>ETH Futures Forward Curve Analysis:</p><p>The futures forward curve projects steadily increasing Ethereum prices into mid-2026, aligning with heightened institutional interest and bullish long-term outlook. This trajectory underscores market confidence in Ethereum’s ongoing developments and strategic positioning in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Conclusion and Key Takeaways for Ethereum traders:</p><ul><li><p>Ethereum futures exhibit significant bullish short-term momentum.</p></li><li><p>Institutional ETF inflows confirm robust investor confidence.</p></li><li><p>Dramatic positive volume shift highlights market rotation favoring Ethereum.</p></li><li><p>Critical technical resistance points at $2,882, $2,920, and $2,967 should guide short-term trading strategies.</p></li></ul><p>Risk Disclaimer:
