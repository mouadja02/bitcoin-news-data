2025-06-11T16:55:54,"‘Covert Pipeline for Dirty Money’ – Crypto Firm Founder Facing Multiple Charges After Allegedly Laundering $500,000,000 Through US Financial System","The Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged a Russian national and crypto executive with allegedly laundering more than $500 million worth of overseas payments through US banks and digital asset exchanges. The DOJ alleges New York resident Iurii Gugnin used his crypto company, Evita, to move dirty money through the US for sanctioned Russian banks, which helped Russian individuals acquire sensitive US technology. Gugnin, who also goes by the names Iurii Mashukov and George Goognin, allegedly had foreign customers who held assets in sanctioned Russian banks pay him in the top stablecoin, Tether’s USDT . The DOJ says the crypto executive would then launder the USDT through digital asset wallets and US bank accounts, eventually converting it into dollars or other fiat currencies. He then allegedly made payments through bank accounts in Manhattan on behalf of his foreign customers, obscuring the source of the funds and defrauding banks and exchanges in the process. Gugnin, 38, was arrested in New York on Monday and charged with wire and bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering compliance program, failing to file suspicious activity reports, money laundering and related conspiracy charges.

2025-06-11T16:42:05,"tBTC launches on Starknet: Expanding Bitcoin’s Role in Multi-Chain DeFi","BitcoinWorld tBTC launches on Starknet: Expanding Bitcoin’s Role in Multi-Chain DeFi Bitcoin holders can now trade, borrow, and execute complex DeFi strategies for just $0.01 per transaction, following Threshold Network’s launch of tBTC on Starknet. This trust-minimized protocol transforms Bitcoin into functional DeFi capital while preserving full user custody. tBTC is now available for direct minting on Starknet via the Threshold UI, allowing users to seamlessly bring native BTC onchain without custodians or intermediaries. With Bitcoin’s average transaction fee at $1.49 ( 7-day moving average, June 2025 ), it’s no match for Starknet’s ultra-low costs, where the same Bitcoin, via tBTC, can be traded, lent, or deployed in complex DeFi strategies for just $0.01 per transaction. “BTC on Bitcoin Mainnet is like gold bars in a vault: valuable but unusable,” said MacLane Wilkison, Co-Founder of Threshold Labs. “At just $0.01 per transaction on Starknet, Bitcoin becomes more than a store of value — it can now be used for small to large-scale trades, executed hundreds of times a day, and as a source of capital to lend or even borrow against. This is Bitcoin as it was meant to be used.” The Numbers: Why Bitcoin DeFi Struggles Current Bitcoin mainnet reality (June 2025 data): Average transaction fee: $1.49 (7-day moving average) Recent peak during congestion: $91.89 (April 2024) Confirmation time: 10-60 minutes Result : Complex DeFi operations become uneconomical: even at $1.49, a $100 trade costs 1.5% in fees. tBTC on Starknet changes the economics: Transaction fees: $0.01 Confirmation: Instant Throughput: 857 TPS (achieved in testing) Result: Bitcoin becomes a working capital, operating at minimal cost. What’s Coming Next for tBTC x Starknet With the launch of tBTC on Starknet, Threshold Network is building the foundation for a Bitcoin-Ethereum economy within a scalable, zero-knowledge environment. tBTC is integrating with Starknet’s most prominent protocols to bring trust-minimized Bitcoin liquidity to trading, borrowing, and beyond. Live on Launch: DEX Trading on Ekubo – Native Starknet DEXs enable deep, efficient trading of tBTC against select pairs. Users can deploy capital with minimal slippage and explore high-frequency strategies at a much lower cost. Coming Soon: tBTC Lending on Vesu – Soon, users can borrow against their tBTC positions without relinquishing custody, via Vesu. This integration mirrors the success of tBTC on Ethereum, where over 25% of the supply is locked in Aave. What Can Users Do with tBTC on Starknet Execute on Select Trading and Borrowing Strategies Provide liquidity at minimal rebalancing costs Use Bitcoin as collateral without selling Manage positions freely on DEXs Trade tBTC or explore staking pairs Enabling New Application Use Cases: Streaming Payments: Enables Bitcoin-backed payments to be sent on a per-second basis. Automated Strategies: Allows BTC to function within smart contract systems while minimizing gas overheads that could reduce returns. Bitcoin-Powered Gaming: Facilitates microtransactions through low-cost, instant Bitcoin-backed transfers, making them viable in gaming environments. What’s Coming Next Perpetuals & CDPs: Upcoming integrations with perp DEXs and collateralized debt protocols will expand risk-managed leverage options and allow BTC to power more complex DeFi tools. Yield Vaults: Future integrations with automated vaults will simplify liquidity management for users and unlock more opportunities with BTC on DeFi. Oracles & Liquidity Infrastructure: Collaborations with major liquidity providers and oracle networks will ensure accurate price feeds and optimal capital deployment. “This fundamentally changes Bitcoin’s role in DeFi,” said Damian Chen, Head of Growth at the Starknet Foundation. “We’re seeing developers revisit ideas killed by high fees. Bitcoin at scale is finally possible on Starknet.” Security Without Compromise Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins that require corporate custody, tBTC uses threshold cryptography. Multiple independent nodes secure Bitcoin deposits, ensuring that no single entity controls funds. No KYC is required, and users maintain Bitcoin sovereignty while accessing DeFi. Starknet’s zero-knowledge proofs provide the scaling. STARK cryptography compresses thousands of transactions into one proof, achieving 857 TPS in testing while maintaining Ethereum’s security guarantees. How to Access tBTC on Starknet Access tBTC on Starknet via 2 ways: Direct Minting from BTC to tBTC (Starknet): https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint Bridge tBTC from Ethereum L1 to Starknet: https://starkgate.starknet.io/ethereum/bridge?mode=deposit With $547 million in TVL , 193 active protocols , and over 11,000 daily users , Starknet has rapidly emerged as a hub for scalable, composable DeFi. Starknet users can now directly mint tBTC — a fully backed, 1:1 representation of native Bitcoin — through the Threshold UI, providing them with seamless access to Bitcoin’s value without intermediaries and with full self-custody. Additionally, users can bridge existing tBTC from Ethereum L1 to Starknet via the official StarkGate bridge, offering even more flexibility for Bitcoin holders to participate in Starknet DeFi. Market Context Despite a $2.1 trillion market cap, Bitcoin’s presence in DeFi remains minimal, with just $6.3 billion (under 0.3%) locked in decentralized protocols, according to DefiLlama data from June 2025. As transaction costs decline and access barriers are removed, the Bitcoin DeFi market has the potential to grow 10–15x, unlocking new utility beyond passive holding and into active, composable participation across DeFi. tBTC has operated since 2020 as the leading trust-minimized Bitcoin protocol. Combined with Starknet’s proven 857 TPS capacity, Bitcoin DeFi can finally scale. About Threshold Network Threshold Network powers tBTC, the leading decentralized, 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset for DeFi. Secured by a 51-of-100 threshold signer model, tBTC enables BTC to move across multiple chains—including Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, and BOB—without requiring custodians or compromising security. With $450M+ in TVL and $3.6B in bridge volume since 2020, Threshold delivers the most robust trust-minimized Bitcoin infrastructure in DeFi. About Starknet Starknet is a permissionless, decentralized zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup that offers high scalability, low fees, and fast finality. Powered by STARK proofs and developed by StarkWare, Starknet is designed for long-term composability, security, and developer flexibility.

2025-06-11T16:30:13,"Bitcoin Outflow Exodus: Investors Show Confidence With Massive Withdrawals From Crypto Exchanges","Following Bitcoin’s recent stunning rebound from the $105,000 threshold, the flagship asset appears to have found robust support and stability above $109,000. With bullish sentiment returning to the market, a report has revealed a massive wave of BTC outflows from crypto exchanges over a long period. A Significant BTC Outflow From Crypto Exchanges Amidst a strong rally by Bitcoin , Alphractal, an advanced on-chain analytics platform, has shed light on the massive BTC outflows from cryptocurrency exchanges over the past 5 years. When a coin is consistently withdrawn from crypto exchanges, it reflects a growing preference for self-custody. According to the on-chain platform, the Bitcoin balance on exchanges has shown a startling pattern since February 2020, with a total of 3.77 million BTC leaving these platforms. These significant BTC outflows during this period are valued at a whopping $219 billion, which is higher than the amount of coins these exchanges are managing to accumulate. Despite how the development may appear, the platform highlighted that this is an indication of selling by investors. “In short, the $219 billion BTC exodus from exchanges doesn’t reflect fear,” Alphractal stated. Rather, it portrays the robust belief of investors who view Bitcoin as the future’s digital gold. It is worth noting that Alphractal considers this trend as one of the strongest indicators of market confidence and maturity. After delving into the Exchange Flux Balance, a key metric that provides clarity on investors’ behavior on crypto platforms, Alphratcal outlined key takeaways in the massive outflows. The first takeaway is a long-term strategy (HODL) by investors as BTC owners move their coins to private wallets. This behavior sends a clear message that these investors view the flagship asset as a long-term store of value and have no immediate plans to sell. While the trend persists, this action demonstrates a high level of confidence in BTC’s long-term prospects . Particularly, these investors are exhibiting their long-term commitment by taking self-custody of their coins, which lowers the available supply and can lead to a supply squeeze. As BTC becomes less available on exchanges or a supply squeeze occurs, it is likely to reduce selling pressure. Historically, this is generally regarded as an exceptionally bullish indication since a tighter supply can raise prices when demand grows. BTC’s Price Makes Key Move With BTC’s on-chain dynamics flashing bullish signals alongside positive, promising chart formations, the asset may gain enough momentum for a sustained upward push. Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst, has forecasted an impending substantial rally for Bitcoin in the following months. The expert anticipates a major rally as BTC makes a perfect Mean Reversion central line along its uptrend, spanning for 2.5 years or since late 2023. As seen in the weekly chart, Bitcoin’s price has currently dropped back below this central level. Should BTC break past the central line, the expert believes it might increase its price to $230,000 before retracing to the line.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-exchange-outflow-exodus/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Exchange Flux Balance|Hodl|Mean Reversion|Trader Tardigrade",cryptocompare

While still modestly up 5% over the past week, SHIB has been bruised by a 23% monthly drop and remains 40% down from a year ago—yet today’s outperformance could signal early momentum for a rebound. Notably, the Shiba Inu protocol has just introduced several upgrades which make SHIB and its ecosystem tokens – TREAT, BONE and LEASH – more efficient and attractive to use. And when combined with other recent and upcoming improvements, these changes help boost the case for a bullish long-term Shiba Inu price prediction . Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB, TREAT, BONE & LEASH All Upgraded – Can This Supercharge the Burn and Trigger a 10x?

SHIB DEFI TOOLKIT JUST LEVELED UP SHIB | BONE | LEASH | TREAT — things just got serious. This isn’t a cosmetic refresh. It’s a total upgrade to the engine that powers how you earn, trade, and burn inside the ecosystem. 1. Precision Liquidity Pools Are Live •LPs can… pic.twitter.com/sFaDIddPyC — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) June 9, 2025 Some of the main improvements include more efficient staking, precision liquidity pools, auto burns triggered by trading activity (e.g. swaps, liquidity actions), and a streamlining of trading interfaces. This all conspires to make the Shiba Inu ecosystem more attractive to seasoned traders, which in turn should boost demand for SHIB and its related tokens. The deployment of these upgrades is arguably part of the reason why the Shiba Inu price has done well today, outperforming the market average. And if we look at its chart, we see that it has begun regaining momentum after a period of decline that began in the middle of May. Its RSI (purple) has jumped up to 50 after plunging to 30 a week ago, while its 30-day average (orange) has bottomed out in relation to the 200-day (blue), suggesting that a big rebound is coming. Source: TradingView Given that SHIB is still 84% down on its ATH of $0.00008616 (set in October 2021), there’s arguably lots of room for the token to continue rising without entering a dangerously overbought region. And if the market continues its gradual improvement of the past few weeks, we could see the Shiba Inu price reach $0.000020 at some point next month. In combination with recent upgrades, upcoming launches, such as that of ShibOS, could also help it reach $0.000050 by Q4. The Next Breakout Token? This New Presale Altcoin Could Outpace SHIB by Miles Because SHIB is waiting on upgrades to take effect and boost wider adoption, it may not experience big gains for several months yet. In that case, investors may prefer to turn to newer tokens with more short-term potential, including presale coins that could rally when they list for the first time. One of the newest and most interesting presale tokens in the market right now is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an Ethereum-based project that will be launching a layer-two network for Bitcoin. The $HYPER Pre-Sale is now LIVE! Get up to speed https://t.co/yzXqAckjDw pic.twitter.com/sij7UFBOcb — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) May 8, 2025 It launched its presale last month, and has already raised in excess of $1 million, pointing to considerable early interest in the token and its platform. Its L2 network will provide Bitcoin users with faster transactions and lower fees, with the platform promising near-instant finality. Initially running on Ethereum, it will also expand to Solana after its launch, taking advantage of the latter’s high scalability. And this will enable Bitcoin Hyper to offer a range of DeFi apps and protocols, enabling BTC holders to put their funds into more volatile meme tokens. This all makes Bitcoin Hyper one of the more interesting new project to watch, with investors able to join its sale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . HYPER is currently available at $0.01185, although this will rise periodically for as long as the sale lasts.

2025-06-11T16:20:50,"Shocking Bitcoin Core Update Sparks OCEAN VP’s Exit From Crypto","BitcoinWorld Shocking Bitcoin Core Update Sparks OCEAN VP’s Exit From Crypto Major news from the world of Bitcoin mining is making waves. Jason Hughes, the vice president of the OCEAN mining pool , a prominent figure in the space, has announced a drastic decision: he is selling all his Bitcoin (BTC) and stepping away from the crypto industry entirely. This isn’t a sudden whim; his departure is directly linked to his strong opposition to an upcoming Bitcoin Core update . OCEAN VP Makes Shocking Exit Over Bitcoin Core Update The news, initially reported by Protos, details Jason Hughes’ significant move. As VP of OCEAN, a mining pool known for its commitment to transparent and non-custodial practices, Hughes’ voice carries weight within the community. His decision to liquidate his entire BTC stack and leave crypto permanently underscores the depth of his concerns regarding the direction of Bitcoin development. Hughes publicly expressed his profound disappointment, specifically calling out 31 developers involved in the project. This indicates a significant ideological rift concerning the future path of Bitcoin Core, the software that underpins the entire Bitcoin network . Understanding the Controversial Bitcoin Core Update v30 At the heart of this controversy is Version 30 of Bitcoin Core, an update slated for release in October. The key change causing friction involves how non-financial data is handled within Bitcoin transactions. Currently, there’s a widely recognized limit of 80 bytes for data included in the OP_RETURN field, which is typically used for embedding small pieces of information on the blockchain. The proposed change in v30 would significantly raise the default allowance for this non-financial data, potentially up to nearly 4MB. While node operators would retain the ability to configure this setting, the increased default is designed to facilitate broader functionality and potentially new use cases on the Bitcoin network . Think things like embedding larger amounts of arbitrary data or enabling more complex transaction types. Key Aspects of the v30 Update: Increased Data Limit: Default allowance for non-financial data jumps from 80 bytes (OP_RETURN) to potentially near 4MB. Purpose: Aims to enable broader functionality and new use cases on the network. Configurability: Node operators can still adjust the setting away from the default. Release Timeline: Currently scheduled for October. Why is the Bitcoin Network Facing Pushback? The proposed increase in the data limit isn’t universally welcomed. Critics, including Jason Hughes and other prominent figures like developers Luke Dashjr and BitcoinMechanic, argue that this change moves Bitcoin away from its original purpose primarily as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Their concerns center on several potential negative impacts: Network Strain: Allowing larger data payloads in transactions could lead to significantly larger block sizes, placing increased strain on the Bitcoin network . This means nodes would need more storage, bandwidth, and processing power to download, validate, and store the blockchain. This could potentially make it harder and more expensive for individuals to run full nodes, leading to increased centralization. Deviation from Purpose: Opponents argue that using the blockchain to store large amounts of non-financial or arbitrary data clutters the ledger and deviates from Bitcoin’s core function as a monetary network. They see this as a misuse of block space, which is a scarce and valuable resource. Impact on Fees: Increased demand for block space due to larger data could potentially drive up transaction fees, making simple Bitcoin transactions more expensive. The Perspective from Bitcoin Mining As VP of an OCEAN mining pool , Jason Hughes’ perspective is particularly relevant. Mining pools are at the forefront of processing transactions and creating new blocks. Miners are directly impacted by changes that affect block size, transaction volume, and network strain. While the update aims to enable new functionalities that might bring new types of transactions (and thus fees), the potential for increased network strain and deviation from core principles is a significant concern for those invested in the long-term health and decentralization of the Bitcoin network . Hughes’ decision highlights that this isn’t just a technical debate among developers; it has real-world consequences for individuals and businesses operating within the ecosystem, prompting even key players like an OCEAN VP to consider their future involvement. Voices of Dissent: The Stance of Luke Dashjr and Others Jason Hughes is not alone in his opposition. Developer Luke Dashjr has been a vocal critic of practices that utilize block space for non-financial data, often referring to them as ‘inscriptions’ or ‘spam’. His stance is rooted in a strict interpretation of Bitcoin’s design, emphasizing its role purely as a monetary system. BitcoinMechanic is another developer aligned with this view, raising concerns about the technical implications and the philosophical direction the project is taking. The fact that Hughes aligns himself with these particular developers underscores that his concerns are deeply technical and ideological, revolving around the fundamental principles he believes the Bitcoin network should uphold. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Community? An executive from a major Bitcoin mining pool exiting the space over a core protocol change is a significant event. It highlights the ongoing, sometimes intense, debates within the Bitcoin community about scalability, block space usage, and the project’s long-term vision. While some developers and users see the v30 update as a way to innovate and expand Bitcoin’s capabilities, others view it as a threat to its core properties of decentralization and its primary function as digital cash. This situation serves as a powerful example of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin development and governance – there’s no single authority dictating changes, leading to robust, sometimes contentious, discussions among developers, users, miners, and businesses. For the average Bitcoin holder or enthusiast, it’s a reminder of the technical complexities and the differing philosophies that shape the network’s evolution. In Conclusion: The departure of OCEAN VP Jason Hughes is a striking development stemming from the controversy surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin Core update v30. His decision, echoed by critics like Luke Dashjr , highlights deep concerns about potential network strain and whether the change aligns with the fundamental purpose of the Bitcoin network . This event underscores the vital, ongoing debate within the community about the future direction and technical evolution of Bitcoin, reminding everyone that even seemingly technical updates can have significant ideological and personal consequences.

2025-06-11T16:19:58,"The quiet campaign to make Scott Bessent the next Fed Chair — why crypto markets should care","What does crypto have to gain, or lose, if Trump taps Scott Bessent as the next Fed Chair and accelerates the shift toward pro-growth, risk-friendly policies? Table of Contents Scott Bessent is quietly rising in conversations about the Next Fed Chair How is the Fed Chair appointed? Scott Bessent Fed Chair talk gains momentum, but rivals like Kevin Warsh loom Decoding the Scott Bessent crypto calculus Experts see both stability and risk in a potential Jerome Powell resignation Scott Bessent is quietly rising in conversations about the Next Fed Chair Scott Bessent , the current U.S. Treasury Secretary, has quietly emerged at the center of a growing conversation around who will lead the Federal Reserve after J erome Powell ’s term ends in May 2026. According to a Jun. 10 report by Bloomberg, discussions are underway within and beyond the Trump administration about the possibility of nominating Bessent as Powell’s successor. While the White House officially dismissed the report as inaccurate, the timing and tone of recent developments suggest the idea may not be entirely off the table. President Trump hinted that a decision could arrive sooner than expected. During public remarks on June 6, he said he would name Powell’s replacement “very soon,” offering a rare public signal about a leadership transition still more than a year away. That comment also marked a shift in tone from earlier this year, when Trump repeatedly criticized Powell for keeping interest rates high. He has argued that elevated rates are harming economic growth and interfering with the administration’s broader goals. Tensions between Trump and Powell date back to Trump’s first term. Although Trump appointed Powell as Fed Chair in 2017, he soon became frustrated with Powell’s monetary policy stance, particularly the rate hikes in 2018 and 2019. The conflict resurfaced during Trump’s second term. Powell’s refusal to lower rates in the face of inflation concerns and Trump’s tariff policies was viewed by some in the administration as obstructive. On Apr. 4, Trump renewed his criticism on Truth Social, writing that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough.” Federal law prevents the president from removing a sitting Fed chair without cause, a point reinforced by a Supreme Court ruling in May 2025 that upheld the Fed’s institutional independence. The decision effectively blocked any attempt to replace Powell before his term expires. Bessent, for his part, advised against such an effort. In an interview with Politico on April 17, he warned that removing Powell early could trigger financial instability and undermine global confidence in U.S. economic governance. How is the Fed Chair appointed? The Fed Chair is nominated by the President of the U.S. and must be confirmed by the Senate. The position carries a four-year term, although reappointments are common, and chairs often serve across multiple administrations. While the Fedis structured to function independently of political pressure, the nomination process remains political in nature, especially during periods of economic volatility or leadership transition. Powell’s current term ends in May 2026, giving the Trump administration more than a year to evaluate potential successors. Even so, early signals about the direction of the nomination can influence market behavior well in advance of any formal decision. Analysts and global financial institutions track these developments closely. Shifts in leadership at the Fed often coincide with changes in monetary policy, interest rate strategy, and financial regulation. The role of the Chair extends beyond setting interest rates. It also includes managing inflation expectations, ensuring financial system stability, and communicating policy direction to domestic and international audiences. For investors, clarity around the next nominee, and the policy philosophy they are likely to bring, can influence confidence levels and capital allocation decisions across both traditional and crypto markets. Scott Bessent Fed Chair talk gains momentum, but rivals like Kevin Warsh loom Bessent’s financial background, including time spent as Soros Fund Management’s chief investment officer, has added to his credibility among Republican economic advisors. Still, Bessent is not the only name being discussed. Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and one of the candidates interviewed for the Treasury Secretary post in late 2024, is considered a strong contender due to his central banking experience. Economist Arthur Laffer has publicly endorsed Warsh, stating, “I think Kevin Warsh is just perfect for the job,” while acknowledging that Bessent’s strengths lie in areas other than monetary policy. Other figures floated include Kevin Hassett, who leads the White House’s National Economic Council, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, and former World Bank President David Malpass. Each brings a different profile, but all are viewed as potentially more aligned with Trump’s economic approach. What makes the situation notable is not just who the next Fed chair might be, but how early the discussion has begun. While Bessent has not publicly confirmed interest in the role, his proximity to decision-makers and his growing influence on Trump’s economic agenda are enough to keep the conversation going. Decoding the Scott Bessent crypto calculus If Bessent is eventually nominated to lead the Fed, the implications would likely go well beyond interest rate decisions. His record as Treasury Secretary already offers early signals about how he might approach monetary leadership. Since taking office in early 2025, Bessent has been a key figure in executing the economic side of President Trump’s policy agenda. He has worked to sustain financial market confidence while backing a mix of tax reductions and tariffs aimed at restructuring global trade relationships. He has also been directly involved in U.S.-China trade negotiations , a process that continues to influence volatility and risk sentiment. Both factors tend to spill over into crypto markets, where shifts in geopolitical or currency outlooks often affect demand for decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Bessent’s name has also been linked to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal, a Trump-era initiative exploring the idea of holding Bitcoin at a national level. While he has not taken a formal position on crypto regulation, several reports have described him as “pro-Bitcoin,” citing his openness to including digital assets within broader economic strategy. In a comment on Jun. 11, Bessent said, “I have the best job in Washington. The president will decide who’s best for the economy and the American people.” Although he did not confirm interest in the Fed Chair position, the remark reinforced the perception that he remains central to Trump’s economic team. If he were to assume leadership of the Fed, markets might expect a tilt toward a more flexible policy approach aligned with Trump’s preference for lower rates and looser financial conditions. During his time at Treasury, Bessent supported fiscal measures focused on growth, many of which benefit from accommodative monetary policy. If those views carry over into a central banking role, traders could interpret it as a signal for future rate cuts, particularly if inflation data continues to ease. Such a stance would likely benefit equities and risk assets, including crypto assets, which tend to perform better in environments where liquidity is high and interest rates are low. Even so, Bessent’s crypto positioning appears tactical rather than ideological. His support for digital assets seems rooted in advancing Trump’s broader economic strategy, rather than stemming from a strong personal belief in blockchain technology. For crypto markets, the more relevant factor may not be direct regulation but the macroeconomic backdrop Bessent would help shape, including interest rate policy, inflation expectations, and fiscal signals that continue to guide capital flows into or out of digital assets. Experts see both stability and risk in a potential Jerome Powell resignation Bessent’s potential nomination has drawn a broad spectrum of reactions from policymakers and market observers. Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance, pointed to Bessent’s standing in the global financial community as a reason to take his candidacy seriously. “Given the amount of trust and confidence that the global financial community has in Scott Bessent, he’s an obvious candidate,” Adams said, while also describing him as “a dark horse candidate,” noting that formal momentum remains uncertain. Steve Bannon, former White House strategist and close adviser to President Trump, spoke more emphatically. He praised Bessent’s policy leadership during a volatile start to 2025 and described him as both loyal to Trump’s agenda and dependable in the eyes of markets. “He’s not just the star of the cabinet, but a safe pair of hands for global capital markets,” Bannon said. Others have raised practical and institutional concerns. Economist Laffer acknowledged Bessent’s strengths but questioned the fit. “He is wonderful, but he already has a job. And his specialty is not monetary policy,” Laffer said. Criticism has also come from lawmakers focused on preserving the Fed’s independence. Senator Elizabeth Warren, speaking on the Senate floor in November 2024, warned that political interference in the central bank could erode investor confidence. “It would be a serious error for the Trump administration to interfere with the Fed’s independence,” she said, adding that placing a loyalist in the role might provoke instability rather than calm. Market veteran Ed Yardeni expressed similar concerns. In an interview with Barron’s, he cited Bessent’s past references to a “shadow Fed chair” model as troubling. Yardeni argued that even the perception of dual leadership could unsettle markets, stating it would “create a lot of noise in the market” and risk amplifying investor anxiety. Market behavior has historically responded quickly to signals around Fed leadership. Following President Trump’s criticism of Powell in April 2025, U.S. equities registered a 2% single-day decline, reflecting how even political rhetoric around the Fed can affect investor sentiment. Crypto markets, which tend to exhibit higher volatility, may react even more sharply to ambiguity or sudden shifts in central bank leadership. Without clarity, short-term swings could intensify. Whether Bessent ultimately calms or unsettles markets may depend less on the nomination itself and more on how investors interpret the balance between his alignment with the White House and his respect for institutional boundaries.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/scott-bessent-next-fed-chair-crypto-impact/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Feature|Federal Reserve|Jerome Powell|Regulation|United States",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T16:19:05,"Bitcoin investor held hostage, tortured for weeks in NYC, prosecutors say","Two defendants pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and torturing a man for weeks over his wallet password. Kidnappings are becoming a serious threat to high-profile crypto investors. On Wednesday, June 11, John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, pleaded not guilty to kidnapping a Bitcoin investor and attempting to steal his wallet data. According to prosecutors, the two men held and tortured the victim for three weeks starting on May 6, in a luxury SoHo apartment in New York. They allegedly beat him, shocked him with electric wires, and held him over a staircase before he managed to escape. The torture was intended to force the investor to hand over his Bitcoin wallet password, which would have given the attackers control over his crypto. If convicted, both suspects face up to life in prison for the brutal kidnapping. You might also like: Why France is suddenly the world’s epicenter for “crypto kidnappings” Bitcoin kidnappings become an increasing risk High-profile Bitcoin and crypto investors are increasingly attractive targets for kidnappers. Unlike traditional banking transfers, crypto transactions cannot be canceled or reversed. This means that once attackers gain access to funds, there is almost no way to retrieve them. For this reason, kidnappers tend to target individuals known to hold substantial crypto investments. Notably, France has become a major epicenter for crypto kidnappings, with at least six incidents recorded by May of 2025.

2025-06-11T16:13:38,"Ukraine Plans to Create Bitcoin Reserve to Strengthen Economy","The Ukrainian lawmakers recently introduced a new bill allowing the country to hold Bitcoin (BTC) in its official reserves. This shows that Ukraine is ready to join other countries that are looking to establish the same bill to support their economy. This move comes as the war-torn country faces economic turmoil and financial uncertainty. Ukraine Proposes Bitcoin as Part of National Reserves The newly proposed draft law is officially registered as Law No. 13356 in the Ukrainian parliament. This new bill authorizes the National Bank of Ukraine to include Bitcoin and other virtual assets in foreign exchange reserves. These reserves already hold gold and other regular currencies. Now, digital assets might be added. This new law lets Ukraine’s central bank choose how and when to use these digital reserves. It does not force immediate action, but it creates a legal path for future decisions. The bank will be responsible for managing these assets wisely. The bill was introduced by People’s Deputy Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a member of parliament who plays an important role in financial planning. He believes that allowing digital assets in the national reserves is a good way to keep up with global trends and improve the economy. Bitcoin As a Hedge Against a Difficult Global Economy Ukraine’s Bitcoin reserve plan comes at an important time. Many countries deal with high inflation, weaker currencies, and unstable markets. As the US dollar loses strength in the global market, some countries seek new ways to keep their economies safe. More people are seeing Bitcoin as a safe haven during an economic crash and a way to hedge against inflation. Ukraine’s interest in holding the flagship crypto for the long term shows that it is planning ahead to face these challenges. With a Bitcoin reserve, Ukraine hopes to stay stable during tough times and be ready to grow. Ukraine Aligns with Crypto-Adopting Nations Ukraine is not the only country making this change. Recently, countries like Pakistan have also talked about building Bitcoin reserves . The Pakistani government is trying new ideas to rebuild and grow its economy. El Salvador was the first to start this trend in 2021 and has already used Bitcoin to attract major investments. This shows how digital money can help boost economies if used wisely in national plans. In the U.S., a certain American military division reportedly supported establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . This shows growing belief in Bitcoin’s future value. Ukraine’s move aligns it with other countries that are changing how they handle money. If the new law passes and is used well, Ukraine could benefit in many ways. This could be a big step in modernizing Ukraine’s financial system and making the country more competitive globally.

2025-06-11T16:07:07,"The Case for Investing in Digital Assets","You’ve been at the forefront of creating digital asset products from an early stage. Why do you think investors should consider putting money into digital assets? First of all, with digital assets, you get a quantitative diversity of return. Per increment of risk to reward, the ratio of the performance of bitcoin to the S&P 500 is more than three to one. So if you're going to invest money, one of the best risk-reward ratios is, without question, in digital assets as a stand-alone asset class. Secondly, you get something new with digital assets that you didn't have before, and that's transparency. Public blockchains are auditable in real time, so they are trustless. You also get economies of scale and capital efficiencies. That's what this technology does — it makes things easier, cheaper, better and faster. Thirdly, I believe bitcoin is one of the most important assets in all of human history because it removes the need of central banks. At the core of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), is recreating traditional financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading, but without relying on centralized intermediaries like banks. This cuts out the middleman. Lastly, as the application layer of Web3 continues to evolve, the ease of use and access becomes better. If you look at the adoption curve now, we're about to hit an acceleration point. Six to eight years ago, the security was just gnarly. Now, you have multi-party computation (MPC) technology and multi-sig wallets, and Chainalysis doing work to ensure illicit funds aren't mixed into the funds you're acquiring. This offers a more robust infrastructure to let the application layer bring product and services to the masses at scale, and easier to use. What are the biggest obstacles preventing people from investing in digital assets? The first is recency bias. We saw in 2022 the failure of FTX, Celsius and others, which was a mix of counterparty failure, fraud and crimes. No one would fault anybody for being hesitant to get into digital assets because of that, but I will point out that the second-most fined company ever in the history of mankind is JP Morgan. So while you can forgive people for recency bias, I would argue they're not appraising it properly against TradFi counterparty risk. Then, whatever people’s recency bias is anchoring them to, the tendency is to follow up with confirmation bias, ""I don't want to touch that asset, since memecoins are down 90%.” So I believe these two biases combined do to not motivate people to underwrite the space properly. Secondly, there’s a lack of understanding and awareness that all TradFi assets are held in “street name,” meaning you don't own it — your brokerage firm does. People also aren't aware that banks’ reserve ratios are in single digit percentages all over the world, meaning if you have money in a bank, it's actually not there. There’s a lack of appreciation of the fractional reserve banking system, which arguably has caused all of the credit crises throughout history. Overall, it’s important to put headlines of bad actors and failed memecoins aside. Look at the infrastructure and all it offers. With Web3, you have shared security or privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. You can participate in certain networks to make them stronger, which then offers you staking yield. If you provide liquidity, you can get an automated market maker (AMM) yield. The system is efficient and strong. What are the best ways to get alpha in today’s volatile markets? First, have an accumulation strategy. This means you pick a portfolio of your best 5, 10, or 20 assets and dollar cost average them. Then, develop a trading plan. For example, if Ethereum drops to $1,200, then what am I doing? Or if Ethereum goes to $4,000, what will I do? Next, you want to “invest with the trend,” which I see as a three-factored process. First, we're looking at the adoption curve. Then, we're looking at monthly data points for the establishment of the trend. Lastly, appraise the progression of the technology and the value proposition of the products and services of the entire space. Those three things are how you effectively contemplate where we are in a trend, in my opinion. Tell me more about the HD CoinDesk Acheilus Fund. We launched the HD Acheilus Fund in mid-May to leverage CoinDesk Indices’ Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators and it's diversified because it trades the CoinDesk 20. This actively managed, single-strategy fund targets institutional investors, aiming to profit from crypto market uptrends while avoiding drawdowns. We use a combination of quantitative and macroeconomic signals to shift between crypto tokens and cash, delivering a disciplined, outcome-driven cryptocurrency investment strategy. In my opinion, this is the easiest push button allocation anybody can ever make in crypto. Our award-winning funds are centered around a dedicated compliance team, ensuring adherence to all CFTC and SEC regulations while anticipating future changes. Also, we have established robust internal policies and procedures that meet or exceed regulatory requirements, covering areas such as anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), data protection, and risk management.

2025-06-11T16:04:48,"Ukraine May Let Central Bank Add Bitcoin to Reserves","Ukrainian lawmakers have submitted a draft bill that would allow the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in its official reserves. The proposal was introduced as bill number 13356 in the Verkhovna Rada this Tuesday. It seeks to amend the law “On the National Bank of Ukraine” by authorizing the central bank to hold crypto assets alongside gold and foreign currencies. Discretionary Power for the Central Bank Unlike mandatory reserve requirements, this draft bill gives the NBU full discretion over crypto holdings. According to MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak, the bill neither compels nor directs the bank to invest in Bitcoin or other crypto assets. “How, when and how much should be the decision of the regulator itself,” Zhelezniak said on his Telegram channel. A Move to Strengthen Economic Stability Lawmakers behind the bill argue that managing crypto reserves could bolster Ukraine’s macroeconomic stability. It would also support the development of the nation’s digital economy. “Proper management of crypto reserves will help strengthen macroeconomic stability and create new opportunities for the development of the digital economy,” Zhelezniak posted on Telegram. Industry Involvement in Drafting The draft bill received input from notable stakeholders. Early in the week, Zhelezniak appeared in a video with Kyrylo Khomiakov, Binance’s regional head for Central & Eastern European and Central Asian countries. Khomiakov was one of the bill’s contributors, following reports that Binance advises several governments on establishing crypto reserves. Legal experts were also involved. Co‑author Petr Bilyk, head of AI practice at Juscutum Legal Engineering and a member of Ukraine’s AI expert committee, helped draft the legislation. A Thoughtful, not Rushed, Initiative Zhelezniak emphasized this isn’t an aggressive push by Kyiv to adopt crypto. Rather, it is a strategic move to avoid being left behind as global interest in digital asset reserves grows. “This story has the right to life, and, as we see, many countries are implementing it,” he said, citing experiments by the U.S., El Salvador, and others. The draft follows earlier reports that Ukraine is nearing final stages of crafting a bill on state crypto reserves. This development comes amid ongoing discussions about peace with Russia, suggesting Ukraine is preparing financially for post-war stability. What Comes Next Broad parliamentary review and debate are expected before the bill advances. If approved, Ukraine would join a small but growing group of nations exploring digital assets as part of sovereign reserves. Observers will be watching how the NBU responds, and whether reserve allocations will remain symbolic or evolve into meaningful financial strategies. Ukraine’s willingness to explore this frontier reflects an appetite for financial innovation, while also recognizing the need for careful oversight.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/ukraine-may-let-central-bank-add-bitcoin-to-reserves/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|BNB","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T16:02:08,"Ethereum Is On The Rise Again! Analysis Company Explains The Reason Behind The Rise In ETH!","The largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has risen to $ 2,800 with the rise it has experienced in the last 24 hours. While the market is expecting ETH to break and exceed the $ 3,000 level, the analysis company evaluated ETH's recent rise. Accordingly, analytics firm Matrixport said that Ethereum's recent rally was due to leverage and not fundamentals. In its latest analysis from the X account, Matrixport highlighted that Ethereum’s outflow was driven by the leveraged trading market rather than the spot market. Analysts stated that the ETH funding rate rose to 13.7%, the highest level since February, and that this level is generally a bullish sign and attracts ETH ETF inflows by mobilizing institutional investors. More importantly, ETH futures open interest is approaching its December 2024 peak, according to analysts, suggesting that leveraged investors, not spot buyers, are leading the ETH rally. “The current Ethereum rally is based on leveraged futures trading, not spot trading. “Ethereum open interest (OI) is near its all-time high from December of last year. Ethereum funding rate has also increased to 13.7%. This is the highest level since February.” Matrixport analysts recently noted a sharp increase in ETH call options. At this point, analysts comparing Ethereum and Bitcoin stated that ETH is driven by the leveraged market rather than spot demand, while Bitcoin continues to be driven primarily by spot demand. *This is not investment advice.

Private sector supports the inclusion of digital assets in reserves 💥 BREAKING: 🇺🇦 UKRAINE PROPOSES BILL TO ALLOW CENTRAL BANK TO HOLD DIGITAL ASSETS IN NATIONAL RESERVES. BULLISH FOR CRYPTO & #XRP pic.twitter.com/8OKunadXRk — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 11, 2025 The government of Ukraine has been preparing an act to establish a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ukraine held approximately 46,351 BTC as of December 2024, valued at $4.8 billion, primarily acquired through asset seizures, donations, and fundraising during the war. The move to create a BTC reserve has received support from the private sector, with the regional Head of Binance for Central and Eastern Europe, Kirill Khomyakov, welcoming the proposal. Khomyakov revealed that establishing the BTC reserve would need significant legislation amendments. The head of Binance added that creating the reserve was a positive step, saying it would lead to clearer regulations regarding crypto assets. In April, Ukraine’s parliamentary Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy passed a new legislation on crypto. The bill was, however, withdrawn following a request from the Office of the President and the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC). The commission later revealed that it had no authority to halt the bill. The NSSMC, however, submitted a list of 80 suggested changes and comments to the parliament. Central banks say Bitcoin unfit for reserves European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde recently trashed the idea of creating European crypto reserves. Lagarde stated there was no place for cryptocurrency in Europe’s central banking. The ECB President said she was confident digital assets would not enter the reserves of Europe’s central banks. Lagarde maintained that the national reserves should remain liquid, safe, and secure. The Czech National Bank also recently announced that its board had agreed to broaden its national reserves portfolio to incorporate other asset classes without pointing out Bitcoin or other digital assets. Poland’s central bank also recently revealed that it would not invest in crypto assets. The bank claimed that cryptocurrency was an asset class bearing a very high risk. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, recently stated that the central bank was not authorized to own digital assets. Martin Schlegel, the president of the Swiss National Bank, said in March that digital assets did not meet the bank’s currency reserve standards, dismissing crypto advocates’ demands that the institution hold BTC as a hedge against increasing global economic uncertainties. Crypto campaigner Luzious Meisser, also Bitcoin Suisse’s board member, argued that holding BTC made more sense as the world moved towards a multipolar order, where the official currencies, the euro and dollar, were weakening. The crypto campaigners had launched an initiative to mount pressure on the SNB to acquire Bitcoin, claiming that the economic crisis triggered by Trump’s tariffs made it more crucial for the institution to diversify government reserves. Schlegel rejected the suggestions, arguing that the digital asset’s market liquidity was a big concern as the institution was required at all times to be able to acquire or sell foreign exchange.

2025-06-11T16:00:29,"Quantum BioPharma Commits $5 Million to Bitcoin and Crypto Assets","BitcoinWorld Quantum BioPharma Commits $5 Million to Bitcoin and Crypto Assets In a move signaling growing confidence in the digital asset space, Nasdaq-listed biotech and medical research firm, Quantum BioPharma , has significantly expanded its cryptocurrency portfolio. The company announced a substantial purchase of additional Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies, bringing their total investment in this asset class to an impressive $5 million . This decision, according to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, received official approval from the company’s board of directors, highlighting a deliberate and strategic approach to integrating digital assets into their financial planning. While the specific ‘other cryptocurrencies’ acquired were not detailed in the announcement, the focus on Bitcoin suggests a foundational belief in the leading digital asset’s value proposition. Why Are Companies Like Quantum BioPharma Pursuing a Bitcoin Investment Strategy? The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin investment and other digital assets to their balance sheets has been gaining momentum, particularly over the past few years. For companies like Quantum BioPharma, operating in a traditional sector like biotech, this move might seem unconventional at first glance. However, several compelling reasons often drive such decisions: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about currency devaluation and inflation rising globally, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value and a hedge against traditional financial system risks due to its decentralized nature and capped supply. Diversification: Adding uncorrelated assets to a corporate treasury can help diversify risk beyond traditional cash, bonds, and equities. Digital assets offer a new avenue for potential growth independent of the core business operations. Potential for Growth: Despite volatility, the long-term growth trajectory of Bitcoin and select cryptocurrencies remains attractive to investors seeking higher potential returns than traditional low-yield assets. Forward-Thinking Stance: Embracing digital assets can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking, potentially appealing to a broader range of investors and stakeholders interested in the future of finance and technology. Cash Management: For companies holding significant cash reserves, especially in a low-interest-rate environment, deploying a portion into digital assets can be seen as a way to generate potential returns on otherwise stagnant capital. Quantum BioPharma’s decision underscores that the appeal of digital assets is extending beyond tech-centric firms and reaching into diverse industries, including the complex world of biotechnology and medical research. Understanding Corporate Crypto Holdings: More Than Just Bitcoin While Bitcoin often grabs the headlines, the concept of corporate crypto holdings encompasses a broader range of digital assets. Companies might choose to hold other cryptocurrencies for various strategic reasons: Ethereum (ETH): As the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum is seen by some as a bet on the future of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs. Stablecoins: Some companies might hold stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) for transactional purposes, ease of transfer, or as a temporary holding place within the crypto ecosystem, though Quantum BioPharma’s announcement focuses on investment assets. Altcoins: A smaller portion might be allocated to other altcoins based on specific research or perceived potential, although this carries significantly higher risk. Quantum BioPharma’s statement mentioning ‘other cryptocurrencies’ alongside Bitcoin suggests a diversified approach within the digital asset class, tailored to their specific risk tolerance and investment objectives. The $5 million total represents a significant commitment for a company whose primary focus is highly specialized scientific research. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption: A Growing Trend The move by Quantum BioPharma is part of a larger narrative of institutional crypto adoption . What began with a few pioneering companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla has evolved into a more widespread phenomenon. Investment funds, asset managers, and now companies from various sectors are exploring or actively engaging with digital assets. This trend is driven by increasing regulatory clarity in some regions, the development of more robust infrastructure for institutional investors (custody solutions, trading platforms), and a growing understanding of the digital asset market. Key indicators of this trend include: Examples of Companies with Significant Bitcoin/Crypto Holdings: Company Industry Notable Holdings (Examples) MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Significant Bitcoin holdings (often the largest corporate holder) Tesla Electric Vehicles & Clean Energy Bitcoin Block, Inc. (formerly Square) Financial Services Bitcoin Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin (from mining operations) Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange Various Cryptocurrencies While Quantum BioPharma’s $5 million holding is modest compared to giants like MicroStrategy, it is significant relative to the company’s likely balance sheet size and signals a broader acceptance of digital assets as a legitimate part of a corporate financial digital asset strategy . Navigating the Challenges and Risks Investing in cryptocurrencies is not without its challenges and risks, particularly for publicly traded companies like Quantum BioPharma. These include: Volatility: Digital asset prices can experience dramatic and rapid fluctuations, which can impact a company’s reported earnings and balance sheet valuation. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, creating potential risks related to compliance, taxation, and future restrictions. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires sophisticated security measures to protect against hacking, theft, and loss of private keys. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for cryptocurrencies are still developing, which can create complexities in financial reporting. Public Perception: While growing, mainstream acceptance of crypto is not universal, and some shareholders or customers may view such investments negatively. Quantum BioPharma’s board approval suggests they have likely considered these factors and established protocols for managing these risks, including secure custody solutions and a clear investment rationale. What Does This Mean for Quantum BioPharma and the Market? For Quantum BioPharma, this investment represents a strategic allocation of capital aimed at potentially enhancing treasury returns and diversifying assets. It positions them among a growing group of companies embracing the future of finance. The success or performance of this digital asset portfolio will likely be watched by investors and potentially influence future corporate treasury decisions within the biotech sector. For the broader market, Quantum BioPharma’s announcement adds another data point to the trend of institutional crypto adoption . Each new company, regardless of sector, that publicly discloses a significant crypto holding contributes to the legitimization and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. It signals to other corporate treasurers and boards that exploring a digital asset strategy is becoming a viable, albeit still relatively novel, option. Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering Crypto Quantum BioPharma’s move offers insights for other companies contemplating adding digital assets to their balance sheet: Board Education & Approval: Ensure leadership understands the asset class, risks, and rationale. Board approval is crucial for legitimacy and governance. Define Objectives: Clearly articulate why you are investing (e.g., inflation hedge, growth, diversification) and what percentage of the treasury is appropriate. Start with Bitcoin: BTC is often the first step due to its liquidity, market cap, and established narrative as ‘digital gold’. Research Custody Solutions: Securely storing digital assets is paramount. Explore reputable institutional-grade custodians. Consult Experts: Engage with legal, accounting, and financial advisors experienced in digital assets. Develop a Policy: Establish clear internal policies for acquisition, management, and risk mitigation. Quantum BioPharma’s $5 million commitment, while a fraction of their total assets, demonstrates that companies are moving beyond just exploring and are actively implementing a digital asset strategy . Conclusion: A Biotech Firm’s Bold Step into Digital Assets Quantum BioPharma’s decision to boost its corporate crypto holdings to $5 million, including significant Bitcoin investment , is a noteworthy development. It signifies the increasing penetration of digital assets into traditional industries and underscores the growing trend of institutional crypto adoption . While risks remain, the strategic rationale based on diversification, inflation hedging, and growth potential is clearly compelling for a growing number of corporate boards. This move by a Nasdaq-listed biotech firm further solidifies the position of digital assets as a legitimate component of a forward-thinking digital asset strategy for companies across diverse sectors.

2025-06-11T16:00:18,"Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: ‘Fair Price’ Today Is $230,000","Bitcoin is once again knocking on the door of price discovery, but researchers at Bitwise Asset Management argue that spot quotations still understate what the network is worth. In their Week 24 Crypto Market Compass circulated late Tuesday, Dr. André Dragosch, Bitwise’s Head of Research for Europe, and analyst Ayush Tripathi calculate that “quantitative models estimate Bitcoin’s hypothetical ‘fair value’ amid the current sovereign default probabilities at around $230,000 today.” The figure implies a premium of just over 110 percent to the market price, which was hovering near $109,600 at press time on 11 June 2025. Bitcoin’s ‘True Worth’ Is Explosive Dragosch ties that assessment to the rally in sovereign-risk hedges. United-States one-year credit-default-swap spreads are trading near half-percentage-point territory—levels last seen during the 2023 debt-ceiling scare—reflecting “broader concerns over the US fiscal deficit,” Reuters reported last week. “Bitcoin can provide an alternative ‘portfolio insurance’ against widespread sovereign defaults as a scarce, decentralised asset which is free of counterparty risks,” the note argues, adding that net interest outlays projected by the Congressional Budget Office point to a tripling of US debt-service costs to roughly $3 trillion by 2030. Related Reading: Bitcoin Skyrockets Past $108,000 Amid US-China Tariff Discussions The macro backdrop, however, is not the only pillar supporting Bitwise’s fair-value call. The firm’s in-house Cryptoasset Sentiment Index shows twelve of fifteen market-breadth gauges trending higher, while the cross-asset risk-appetite index (CARA) compiled from equities, credit, rates and commodities has surged to a five-year high. “Both cryptoasset and cross-asset sentiment are now decisively bullish,” Dragosch writes, noting that Bitcoin’s climb back above $110,000 places it within two percent of the all-time high near $112,000 set in May. On-chain data remain constructive. Exchange reserves have slipped to 2.91 million BTC—about 14.6 percent of the circulating supply—after whales withdrew an estimated 390,632 BTC last week. At the same time, net exchange-spot outflows slowed to roughly $0.53 billion from $1.78 billion the previous week, suggesting lighter profit-taking pressure. Derivative positioning echoes the spot-market resilience. Aggregate Bitcoin futures open interest added 2,200 BTC across venues, while the CME leg gained 6.4 k BTC. Funding rates on perpetual swaps stayed positive overall despite flipping negative for parts of the weekend, and the three-month annualised basis held around 6.3 percent. In options, open interest expanded by 27,300 BTC, with the put-to-call ratio settling at 0.55; one-month 25-delta skew remained modestly negative, implying continued demand for downside hedges even as realised volatility slipped to 28.2 percent. Institutional flows are reinforcing the bullish tone. Global crypto ETPs absorbed $488.5 million last week, of which $254.9 million went into Bitcoin products. US spot Bitcoin ETFs led the charge with $525 million of inflows, counterbalanced by a $24.1 million weekly leak from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Bitwise’s own BITB vehicle attracted $78.1 million, while its European physical Bitcoin ETP (BTCE) saw only marginal outflows. Ethereum products also enjoyed $260.9 million in net inflows, maintaining the broad-based risk bid. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative Bitwise concedes that headline risk can still provoke sharp, short-lived drawdowns—last week’s spat between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump briefly drove BTC back to $100,000—but sees structural forces firmly tilted to the upside. “US economic policy uncertainty has most likely passed its zenith already and continues to decline at the margin,” Dragosch writes, pointing to May non-farm-payroll growth of 139,000 and a moderation in recession odds. With Bitcoin already outperforming traditional assets year-to-date and cross-asset sentiment now confirmed by Bitwise’s indicators, the analysts argue that the market is beginning to price the asset less as a speculative vehicle and more as a macro hedge. Whether traders embrace the $230,000 fair-value marker hinges on the same variables underscored in the note—sovereign-risk premiums, policy uncertainty and the pace of institutional adoption—but the groundwork, they say, is visible on-chain, on desks and in the flow data. “Bitcoin also reclaimed 110k USD and is close to its previous all-time high,” the report reminds readers. For Bitwise, that proximity is not an end point but a staging area: the monetary asset’s intrinsic value, they conclude, resides “considerably further north.” At press time, BTC traded at $109,617.

2025-06-11T16:00:00,"U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Marks Milestone in Institutional Adoption: Gemini","*** NOT FOR PUBLICATION - EMBARGOED TILL 12PM ET JUNE 11 *** The formation of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) marks a pivotal step in bitcoin’s BTC evolution as an institutional asset, crypto exchange Gemini said in a Thursday report co-authored with data firm Glassnode. With over 30% of circulating supply now held by centralized entities including exchanges, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), companies and sovereigns, bitcoin is undergoing a structural shift driven by long-term capital and strategic custody, the report said. Each sovereign dollar invested in bitcoin carries an outsized impact, the report said, with $1 of SBR capital potentially generating $25 in market cap expansion and $1.70 in lasting value. This shows the ""reflexive power of institutional inflows."" U.S. President Donald Trump directed his administration in March to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve to hold the assets that have been seized by the government. He also called for a stockpile of other types of digital assets. Though seeded with seized assets, the SBR validates the largest cryptocurrency's place in modern reserve strategy, one increasingly reflected in how institutions value and integrate the asset into global finance, the note said. While early holders still dominate ownership, sovereign endorsement is accelerating institutional confidence, according to Gemini. Liquid supply remains stable as assets migrate from exchanges to custodians, signaling consolidation rather than contraction, the report noted. Bitcoin volatility has declined, which is good for adoption. Recent cycles have been ""defined by more consistent, sustained rallies that appeal to long-term investors,"" the report added.

Price Analysis","Bitcoin (BTC) is managing to stay strong above $109,000, having done so for the last couple of days. With U.S. CPI data about to be released on Wednesday, could this provide the boost that sends $BTC up past the all-time high and into price discovery? $BTC continues to hold $109,000 support level Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart reveals that the $BTC price is continuing to hold the $109,000 support level. This level will be key for the bulls to hold as $BTC will need a secure base from which to climb back to the all-time high. A slight resistance at $109,600 is keeping the price at bay for the time being, but with U.S. CPI data just about to be released, if positive, a surge to $112,000 has the potential to take place quite quickly. If the data comes in negative, a dip could occur which might bring $BTC back to around $107,000, with $106,000 a strong support level just below this. Generally positive on daily time frame Source: TradingView On the daily time frame all is looking quite good for Bitcoin. The exit from the small wedge was successful, and has resulted in the $BTC currently consolidating above that $109,000 level. There is just one point of concern, in that the Stochastic RSI indicators are reaching the top in this time frame. This also coincides with the 8-hour and 12-hour time frames where the indicators are now on the way down. All this said, if bullish price movement does start to occur, these indicators can turn back around relatively quickly. 2-week time frame very bullish for $BTC Source: TradingView The 2-week chart reveals the entire bull market for Bitcoin to date. Paying particular attention to the two indicators at the bottom of the chart it can be seen that there could be more positive price action to come. The Stochastic RSI has its indicators just having crossed up through the 50.00 level, signalling plenty of upside price momentum, while the MACD at the bottom of the chart has just experienced a cross up of the indicator lines as the green histogram bars are just beginning to grow. At time of going to press, the U.S. CPI data has been released . This was cooler than expected for May, so it seems the Trump tariffs have not trickled through to affect the data negatively thus far.

2025-06-11T15:50:25,"Altcoin Season Alert: Index Shows Crypto Market in Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Alert: Index Shows Crypto Market in Bitcoin Season Are you wondering whether it’s time for altcoins to shine? The latest data from a key industry metric suggests we’re not quite there yet. The Altcoin Season Index, a popular gauge for understanding the current state of the crypto market , recently registered a figure that firmly places us in ‘Bitcoin Season’. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for investors trying to navigate the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency space. Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index provides a snapshot of how the broader market is performing relative to Bitcoin over a specific period. What it Measures: The index looks at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The Timeframe: It specifically analyzes the performance of these top altcoins compared to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Thresholds: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. For the market to be considered in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority of these top altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Specifically, at least 75% of the top 100 coins need to have posted better returns than BTC. Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day window. Anything in between is often considered a transition period or ‘Other’. Currently: It’s Bitcoin Season As of 00:33 UTC on June 11, the Altcoin Season Index stood at 31. While this was a slight increase of two points from the previous day, it remains well below the 75 threshold required for Altcoin Season and firmly within the zone indicating Bitcoin Season . This means that over the last three months, a large percentage of the top 100 altcoins have underperformed relative to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been the dominant performer, capturing a larger share of market gains or holding value better during downturns compared to most other cryptocurrencies. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for the Crypto Market? When the market is in Bitcoin Season , it typically signifies that capital is flowing primarily into Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin is leading the market movements. This can happen for several reasons: Dominance Shift: Bitcoin’s market dominance tends to increase. Safe Haven Narrative: In uncertain economic times or during periods of market consolidation, investors may view Bitcoin as a relatively safer asset compared to the more volatile altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional inflows often target Bitcoin first, before potentially moving down the market cap ladder. Pre-Alt Season Consolidation: Sometimes, Bitcoin Season precedes an Altcoin Season, acting as a phase where Bitcoin consolidates gains or makes significant moves before capital rotates into altcoins seeking higher potential returns. For participants in the crypto market , Bitcoin Season means that simply holding a diversified basket of altcoins might not yield optimal results compared to focusing on Bitcoin or carefully selecting altcoins with strong individual catalysts. Why Isn’t It Altcoin Season Yet? Investors eagerly anticipate Altcoin Season because it’s historically the period where many smaller cryptocurrencies experience explosive growth, often posting returns that far outstrip Bitcoin’s performance. However, the index at 31 clearly shows that the broad altcoin market is not currently in this phase. Factors preventing a widespread Altcoin Season might include: Lack of strong, broad market narratives driving capital into altcoins. Lingering macroeconomic uncertainty. Focus remaining on Bitcoin due to specific events (like ETF performance or halving cycle aftermath). Altcoins consolidating after previous runs. Navigating the Current Cryptocurrency Landscape So, how should you approach the cryptocurrency market when the Altcoin Season Index indicates Bitcoin Season? Here are a few considerations: Focus on Bitcoin: Given Bitcoin’s current dominance, it may be a primary focus for investment during this period. Selective Altcoin Investing: Instead of broad diversification across altcoins, focus on specific projects with strong fundamentals, upcoming milestones, or unique narratives that might allow them to outperform even in a Bitcoin-dominated market. Risk Management: Altcoins can be particularly volatile when not in their peak season. Employ robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-losses and not over-allocating to single altcoin positions. Observe Market Rotation: Keep a close eye on market dynamics. Signs that the index is rising towards the 75 threshold could indicate capital starting to rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. Stay Informed: Follow news and developments for both Bitcoin and promising altcoin projects. Understanding the catalysts driving individual assets is crucial. The current index reading serves as a reminder that market cycles are real and understanding the prevailing conditions is key to making informed investment decisions in the volatile world of cryptocurrency . Conclusion: Patience During Bitcoin’s Reign The Altcoin Season Index sitting at 31 confirms that the crypto market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . This means that, for now, Bitcoin is the primary driver and performer compared to the majority of the top 100 altcoins. While this might temper the excitement for immediate, broad altcoin rallies, it provides clarity on the current market structure. Understanding this phase is crucial for investors. It calls for potentially shifting focus towards Bitcoin or being highly selective with altcoin exposure, rather than expecting widespread gains across the board. While Altcoin Season remains a highly anticipated event, the current data suggests patience is required. Keep monitoring the index and market dynamics for signs of a potential shift, but for now, Bitcoin holds the crown.

The Singapore-based firm mined 196 BTC last month — up 18% from April — as it pushed forward the deployment of its SEALMINER A2 rigs across data centers in the U.S., Norway, and Bhutan. The company’s proprietary hashrate now sits at 13.6 exahashes per second (EH/s), thanks to the energization of 3.9 EH/s worth of SEALMINER A1 machines and the ongoing rollout of the A2 line. Bitdeer also shipped 1.6 EH/s of SEALMINER A2 units to external customers during the month, signaling growing adoption of its mining hardware. The firm’s infrastructure buildouts are also gaining pace. In Norway, 70 megawatts (MW) of a planned 175 MW expansion at Tydal are already online, with the remaining 105 MW expected to be energized by the end of June. In Bhutan, the Jigmeling site has begun energization, with plans to bring an additional 368 MW online for a total of 500 MW. A 221 MW facility in Massillon, Ohio, remains on track for phased completion through the second half of the year. The company’s reach is extending into new markets. Bitdeer is preparing a 50 MW site in Ethiopia with support from a local partner and has secured a fully licensed property in Alberta, Canada, where it will build a natural gas power plant to support mining operations. In May, Tether exercised warrants from a previous financing round, providing Bitdeer with $50 million in cash in exchange for over 5 million shares.

2025-06-11T15:40:20,"Exciting Move: CoinShares Registers Solana ETF Entity in Delaware","BitcoinWorld Exciting Move: CoinShares Registers Solana ETF Entity in Delaware Big news shaking up the digital asset world! CoinShares, a major player in the European digital asset investment space, has taken a significant step towards potentially bringing a Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the United States. The firm recently registered the entity specifically for this proposed Solana ETF in Delaware, a key jurisdiction for corporate filings in the U.S. This development is more than just administrative paperwork. It signals serious intent from a reputable firm like CoinShares to explore offering regulated investment products based on Solana, one of the leading smart contract platforms in the crypto market. For investors looking for easier ways to get exposure to SOL, this could be a game-changer. What is a Crypto ETF and Why Does Delaware Matter? Before diving deeper into the specifics of the potential SOL ETF , let’s quickly touch on what an ETF is and why the Delaware registration is noteworthy. An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund that holds assets (like stocks, bonds, or in this case, cryptocurrency) and is traded on stock exchanges. Think of it as a basket of assets you can buy or sell like a single stock. Crypto ETFs aim to provide investors with exposure to cryptocurrencies without the need to directly buy, store, and secure the underlying digital asset themselves. Delaware is a popular state for corporate registration in the U.S. due to its business-friendly laws and established legal framework. Registering an entity here is a standard procedure when setting up a new fund or investment vehicle intended to operate in the U.S. market. While this registration doesn’t mean the ETF is approved or will definitely launch, it’s a necessary foundational step in the lengthy process of potentially getting a Crypto ETF listed and traded on a U.S. exchange. Why is CoinShares Focusing on Solana? CoinShares is no stranger to the digital asset space. They offer a range of crypto investment products in Europe, including physically-backed exchange-traded products (ETPs) for various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and yes, Solana. Their existing experience with Solana likely plays a role in this U.S. initiative. Solana itself has emerged as a prominent blockchain platform known for its high transaction throughput and low costs compared to some other networks. It hosts a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), including those in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and gaming. Its performance and expanding ecosystem have attracted significant attention from both retail and institutional investors, making it a logical candidate for a regulated investment product like an ETF. Potential Benefits of a CoinShares Solana ETF If a CoinShares Solana ETF were to receive regulatory approval and launch in the U.S., it could offer several advantages for investors: Accessibility: It would allow investors to gain exposure to SOL through traditional brokerage accounts, making it as easy as buying stocks. This removes the complexities of setting up crypto wallets, dealing with exchanges, and managing private keys. Liquidity: ETFs are typically highly liquid, meaning investors can easily buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices. Regulation: An approved ETF would operate under regulatory oversight, potentially offering a level of investor protection and confidence not always associated with direct crypto investments. Diversification within Traditional Portfolios: It provides a straightforward way for traditional investors to add exposure to the digital asset class, specifically Solana, within their existing investment portfolios. Institutional Interest: The availability of a regulated Solana product could further attract institutional investors who face restrictions or hesitations about holding cryptocurrencies directly. This potential new avenue for Digital Asset Investment could broaden the investor base for Solana significantly. What Are the Hurdles for a U.S. Crypto ETF? While the Delaware registration is a positive sign of intent, the path to launching a cryptocurrency ETF in the United States is challenging, particularly for those holding the underlying asset (spot ETFs). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious about approving spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. While Bitcoin spot ETFs were recently approved, the regulatory stance on other cryptocurrencies like Solana remains less certain. Key challenges include: Regulatory Approval: The primary hurdle is obtaining approval from the SEC. This involves demonstrating that the fund meets stringent requirements regarding investor protection, market surveillance, and custody of assets. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators often express concerns about the potential for manipulation in underlying crypto markets, which can impact the price of an ETF. Custody Solutions: Securely holding the underlying SOL tokens with a regulated custodian is a critical requirement for a spot ETF. Competition: If approved, a CoinShares SOL ETF would enter a potentially competitive market landscape as other firms might also pursue similar products. The process involves extensive dialogue with regulators and meeting strict compliance standards. The success of the recently launched Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. might pave the way for other crypto assets, but it is by no means guaranteed. Comparing the U.S. and European Crypto ETF Landscape It’s worth noting the difference in the regulatory landscape between Europe and the U.S. Europe has been more open to approving physically-backed crypto ETPs, which function similarly to ETFs. Firms like CoinShares already offer these products for various cryptocurrencies across European exchanges. This experience gives CoinShares valuable expertise in managing and structuring such products, which they can leverage in their U.S. efforts. In contrast, the U.S. has only recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, after years of applications being denied. This suggests a more cautious and perhaps slower approach from U.S. regulators compared to their European counterparts when it comes to broader Digital Asset Investment products beyond Bitcoin futures ETFs. What This Means for Solana and Digital Asset Investment The registration by CoinShares is a positive signal for the Solana ecosystem. It indicates growing institutional interest and the potential for increased mainstream adoption if an ETF is eventually launched. While the regulatory path is uncertain, this step highlights Solana’s increasing prominence as a digital asset class that major investment firms are considering for regulated products. For the broader Crypto ETF market, this shows that firms are actively exploring expanding their offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting a maturing market where other established cryptocurrencies are gaining recognition as investable assets. This push towards more varied crypto investment products could significantly impact the future of Digital Asset Investment by making it more accessible and integrated into traditional finance. Actionable Insights for Investors What should investors take away from this development? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on regulatory developments regarding cryptocurrency ETFs in the U.S. The process can be lengthy and subject to regulatory decisions. Understand the Product: If a Solana ETF launches, understand how it works, its fees, and how its performance tracks the underlying asset before investing. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency markets, including Solana, are volatile. Any investment, whether direct or via an ETF, carries significant risk. Consider Your Investment Goals: An ETF is just one way to gain exposure. Evaluate if it aligns with your overall investment strategy compared to direct ownership or other products. This registration is an early stage, but it puts a potential CoinShares SOL ETF on the radar for anyone interested in regulated crypto investment opportunities. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of SOL Investment? CoinShares registering an entity for a proposed Solana ETF in Delaware is a notable development in the evolving landscape of Digital Asset Investment . While regulatory approval in the U.S. is not guaranteed and faces significant hurdles, this action by a leading European firm underscores the growing institutional confidence in Solana as an asset class and the persistent demand for regulated crypto investment products. This move could be an early indicator of future trends in the Crypto ETF market, potentially opening doors for other altcoins to be considered for similar investment vehicles. Investors should view this development with cautious optimism, recognizing it as a positive step towards potential increased accessibility and mainstream integration for Solana, but also understanding that the journey to a live Solana ETF in the U.S. is still subject to regulatory review and market conditions. It’s an exciting prospect that highlights the ongoing maturation of the digital asset space.

2025-06-11T15:32:30,"Analysts predict Bitcoin could surge to $200,000 by end of 2025","Recent forecasts suggest that Bitcoin could reach staggering heights, with some analysts predicting a price surge to $230,000 by the end of 2025. As BTC holds strong above $109,000, the optimism surrounding its future value is fueled by institutional demand, macroeconomic factors, and evolving market dynamics. This article explores the basis for these bold predictions, the current state of Bitcoin, and the potential implications for investors. Why analysts are eyeing $230,000 by 2025 Bitcoin could climb past $200,000 by the end of the year and eventually reach its estimated “fair value” of $230,000, according to Bitwise researchers André Dragosch and Ayush Tripathi. In their latest crypto outlook, the analysts attribute this bullish scenario to the mounting fiscal strain in the US and a shifting macroeconomic backdrop that favors scarce, non-sovereign assets. Dragosch and Tripathi highlight the US federal government’s expanding debt burden, particularly the gap between mandatory spending and tax revenue, as a major structural issue. The Congressional Budget Office expects net interest payments on debt to triple to $3 trillion by 2030, fueling concerns over long-term sustainability and potential default risks. Compounding the issue is President Donald Trump’s proposed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a sweeping tax cut plan that analysts say could significantly worsen the fiscal outlook. The researchers noted that Trump’s plan is already contributing to market volatility and political risk perception, which in turn could drive more capital into Bitcoin as a hedge. “Bitcoin’s scarcity and resilience position it uniquely to benefit from both fiscal instability and improving market sentiment,” Bitwise said in the report. The digital asset’s performance in the aftermath of last week’s Trump-Musk feud, where Elon Musk publicly criticized the tax cut proposal, was cited as a real-time example of how Bitcoin reacts to “sovereign stress.” If current trends persist, Bitwise believes Bitcoin could not only exceed its all-time highs but also reprice to reflect its role as a macro hedge and store of value in an increasingly fragile financial system. Bullish calls from all around ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has doubled down on her ultra-bullish Bitcoin thesis, forecasting that the cryptocurrency could reach at least $1.5 million by the end of the decade. In an appearance on The Diary of a CEO podcast, Wood pointed to deepening institutional interest and structural market changes as key long-term drivers of Bitcoin’s value. “Bitcoin is more of an investment because it does appreciate over time,” Wood said, arguing that the asset is increasingly being viewed through the lens of portfolio diversification and capital preservation rather than speculation. She emphasized that institutional involvement is still in its infancy, with corporate treasuries and fund managers only beginning to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Wood’s comments align with the broader narrative of accelerating adoption, particularly among institutional investors seeking a hedge amid fiscal uncertainty and monetary debasement. Echoing that sentiment, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor told Bloomberg that fears of a renewed crypto winter are misplaced. “Winter is not coming back,” he said. “We’re past that phase; if Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” Saylor cited Bitcoin’s constrained supply dynamics, noting that only around 450 BTC—worth roughly $50 million at current prices—are mined each day. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” he argued. He also pointed to continued corporate accumulation, which he said is absorbing most of the daily supply.

2025-06-11T15:31:26,"ETH Futures Open Interest Hits New ATH, Exceeding $41B","Ethereum (ETH) isn’t just climbing price-wise; it’s also positioning itself as the centerpiece of a massive derivatives play, with data from CoinGlass showing ETH futures open interest (OI) has surged to a historic high, going past $41 billion. This milestone coincided with Ethereum breaking key resistance levels and significantly outpacing Bitcoin (BTC) in derivatives trading volume. Derivatives Data Tells a Compelling Story According to CoinGlass, in the last 24 hours, ETH futures OI jumped 6.14% to $41.66 billion , building on a steady upward trend that kicked off in early May when the metric stood at just over $21 billion. Previous highs were recorded at $37.66 billion on June 10 and $35.87 billion on June 3. The latest uptick isn’t isolated either. In the last 24 hours, ETH derivatives volume skyrocketed almost 33% to $109.28 billion, surpassing BTC’s $77.22 billion in the same period. Binance dominated the landscape, commanding $7.59 billion in ETH OI and $27.88 billion in volume. It was followed by Gate, boasting $5.71 billion worth of OI, with Bitget and Bybit holding $4.33 billion and $3.90 billion, respectively. Notably, the long/short account ratio on Binance stood at 1.20, indicating bullish sentiment, while top traders were aggressively long with a position ratio exceeding 3.0. However, the heightened leverage also introduced volatility. Over the past day, $124.5 million in ETH positions were liquidated, $77.6 million in shorts, and $46.9 million in longs, highlighting the risk that accompanies this aggressive trading activity. Price Action Mirrors the Leveraged Bets The development comes against a backdrop of strong price appreciation for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. As reported previously by CryptoPotato , the asset briefly peaked at $2,822 on June 11, marking a 15-week high . It also signified a crucial breakout above the stubborn $2,700 resistance level that had capped gains for weeks, setting the stage for a run toward the psychological $3,500 barrier. At the time of this writing, ETH was trading at around $2,766, a 4.7% rise across the last seven days, just edging out the broader crypto market’s 4.5% jump in the same time frame. The altcoin’s momentum is backed by more than just hype. Market watchers have cited key catalysts such as Vitalik Buterin’s recently unveiled scaling roadmap and regulatory clarity on staking and decentralized finance (DeFi) from the SEC for being behind ETH’s improved performance.

2025-06-11T15:30:05,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index Soars to 72: Understanding Market Sentiment","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index Soars to 72: Understanding Market Sentiment In the dynamic world of digital assets, understanding the collective mood of investors is crucial. One of the most popular tools for gauging this feeling is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . As of June 11, this widely watched indicator, provided by Alternative, registered a significant reading of 72, marking a one-point increase from the previous day and keeping the market firmly planted in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this number truly signify for those navigating the exciting yet volatile crypto landscape? What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is essentially a barometer for measuring the prevailing crypto market sentiment . It aims to quantify the emotional state of cryptocurrency investors and traders. The underlying principle is simple: when the market is experiencing ‘Extreme Fear’, it often signals a potential buying opportunity because investors are selling off assets irrationally. Conversely, when the market is in ‘Extreme Greed’, it might suggest the market is due for a correction, as investors could be buying into inflated prices. The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed A reading of 72, as we see now, places the market squarely in the upper half of the ‘Greed’ territory. How is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on a single factor but is a weighted average of several key market indicators . Understanding these components helps demystify the score: Alternative’s index considers six different data sources: 1. Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility, especially on the downside, tends to increase fear. 2. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): This factor looks at the current volume and market momentum compared to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market typically indicates greed. 3. Social Media (15%): This analyzes posts on social media platforms like Twitter (now X) for specific keywords related to cryptocurrency. High volumes of positive posts and sentiment can push the index towards greed. 4. Surveys (15%): While currently paused by Alternative, this component previously gathered sentiment from weekly polls. Investor surveys provide direct insight into public feeling, though this weight might be adjusted if surveys are not active. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is considered. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear (as investors might be fleeing altcoins for the relative safety of BTC) or greed (if BTC is leading a strong bull run). The index interprets this based on market context. 6. Google Trends (10%): This analyzes Google Search data for search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest, particularly for terms like ‘Bitcoin price prediction’ or ‘buy crypto’, can signal increasing public interest and potentially greed. What Does a Reading of 72 (Greed) Mean? A reading of 72 suggests that investors are feeling confident, optimistic, and perhaps overly enthusiastic about the market’s prospects. This level of greed indicates that: Prices have likely been increasing: Greed often follows periods of significant price pumps, as investors become excited and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) sets in. Buying pressure is high: More people are looking to buy than sell, driving prices up. Risk tolerance may be elevated: Investors might be taking on more risk, potentially investing in riskier altcoins or using leverage, fueled by the belief that prices will continue to rise. Potential for overextension: While not a guarantee, high levels of greed can sometimes precede a market correction, as the buying pressure becomes unsustainable and early buyers start taking profits. It’s important to remember that ‘Greed’ doesn’t automatically mean a crash is imminent. It simply reflects the current psychological state of the market participants based on the analyzed factors. Sustained greed can persist during strong bull runs. Navigating the Market When the Index Shows Greed For those looking at current crypto trends , the index provides a piece of the puzzle. When the index is high, it’s often seen as a potential warning sign by experienced traders who use it as a contrarian indicator. The famous quote attributed to Warren Buffett, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” encapsulates this approach. However, relying solely on the index is not advisable. It’s one data point among many. Consider these actionable insights: Exercise Caution: A high index reading suggests the market is running hot. This might be a time to be more selective with new investments. Review Your Portfolio: If you’ve accumulated significant gains, a period of high greed might be an opportune time to consider taking some profits, reducing risk, or rebalancing your portfolio. Avoid FOMO: Don’t let the market’s enthusiasm push you into making impulsive buying decisions, especially on assets that have already seen massive pumps. Look Beyond the Index: Combine the index’s signal with other forms of analysis, such as technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) and fundamental analysis (project developments, adoption rates, regulatory news). Understand the Risks: Regardless of the index reading, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Market Sentiment As mentioned, Bitcoin dominance is one of the factors influencing the index. Bitcoin’s position as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap means its movements and relative strength significantly impact overall market sentiment. When Bitcoin is performing strongly and its dominance is increasing, it can sometimes pull the entire market up, contributing to a feeling of optimism or greed. Conversely, if Bitcoin struggles, it can weigh down the market mood. The interplay between Bitcoin’s performance, its dominance, and altcoin movements is a complex but vital aspect of understanding broader crypto trends. Conclusion: Greed Prevails, But Vigilance is Key The rise of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 72 clearly indicates that positive sentiment currently dominates the market. Investors are feeling confident, and the enthusiasm is palpable. While this reflects a period of potential growth and opportunity, a high ‘Greed’ score serves as a reminder that markets can become overheated. Savvy participants use this indicator not just as a sign to join the frenzy but as a prompt for careful consideration and risk management. Staying informed about various market indicators and adopting a balanced perspective, rather than being solely driven by emotion, remains the cornerstone of navigating the ever-evolving crypto space.

2025-06-11T15:29:46,"FTX Creditors Can Now Choose Payoneer for Post-Bankruptcy Payments","FTX has added global fintech firm Payoneer to its list of approved distributors for creditor payouts, the FTX Recovery Trust and FTX Digital Markets confirmed Tuesday. Key Takeaways: FTX has added Payoneer as a distributor for post-May 30, 2025 creditor payouts. The Chapter 11 repayment plan aims to return up to $16.5 billion to former customers. Analysts warn the payouts could introduce short-term crypto market volatility. Payoneer becomes the third official distributor for FTX and the second for FTX Digital Markets, and will handle payments dated after May 30, 2025, according to a June 10 announcement . The move is aimed at expanding payment accessibility as FTX proceeds with its bankruptcy repayment plan, which began its second major distribution, totaling over $5 billion, at the end of May. FTX Repayment Plan Targets $16.5B in Customer Payouts Under Chapter 11 The broader repayment effort, part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, is expected to return between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion to former customers. Despite Payoneer’s reach across 93 jurisdictions, some users have voiced frustration on social media, saying their countries are still excluded from the list of eligible payout regions. Others remain critical of FTX’s valuation methodology, which calculates payouts based on crypto prices at the time of the exchange’s collapse in November 2022, when bitcoin was worth just $17,583, compared to over $109,000 today. (2/2) FTX also reminds customers to please remain aware of phishing emails that may look like they are from FTX and scam sites from channels that may appear to look like the FTX Customer Portal. — FTX (@FTX_Official) June 10, 2025 On May 30, the FTX Trust began distributing $5 billion to eligible creditors who completed pre-distribution requirements, targeting both the Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes. Under the plan, Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims are set to receive a 72% distribution, while US Customer Entitlement Claims will see a 54% payout. Convenience Claims will receive a full 120% reimbursement. General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims are scheduled for a 61% distribution. The FTX reimbursements are being closely watched by crypto investors, as large liquidity injections from these payouts could impact digital asset markets. Analysts warn that if recipients choose to offload or swap their recovered funds on retail exchanges, it could introduce short-term price volatility. This was the second major disbursement since FTX’s collapse. The first round of payments, totaling $1.2 billion, was distributed on February 18 to claimants with less than $50,000 in approved claims. Sam Bankman-Fried’s Release Date Set for 2044 FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now projected to be released from federal prison on December 14, 2044 , after serving less than 21 years of his 25-year sentence for fraud tied to the FTX collapse. He was also fined over $11 billion. Federal records confirm that Bankman-Fried has been moved from New York to a transfer facility in Oklahoma following nearly two years behind bars. The move comes after Bankman-Fried was reportedly placed in solitary confinement earlier this month for giving an unauthorized interview to Tucker Carlson. His incarceration began in August 2023, after Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked his bail due to allegations of witness tampering involving leaked diary entries from former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, who was a key witness in the case.

2025-06-11T15:22:00,"Rep. Timmons Demands SEC Records on Ether’s Status Under Gensler Leadership","U.S. Representative William Timmons has called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to release documents related to its evolving stance on Ether (ETH). The letter cites confusion caused by the SEC’s inconsistent classification of ETH, especially between 2018 and 2024 highlighting what he describes as the agency’s “zigzagging approach” under the leadership of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Rep. Timmons Demands SEC Records on Ether’s Legal Status In a letter dated June 10, Timmons asked SEC Chair Paul Atkins to provide records that explain the agency’s position on ETH’s classification. He said the documents are needed to bring clarity to a regulatory environment that has confused both the public and lawmakers. “Under prior leadership, the SEC refused to articulate a consistent, coherent view on how it believed the securities laws apply to digital assets,” Timmons wrote. “Its zigzagging approach to ETH is a case in point.” I just sent a letter to SEC Chair Atkins requesting documents on the SEC’s inconsistent treatment of ETH under Chair Gensler and the Biden administration. The American people—and the crypto community—deserve transparency as Congress moves forward with the CLARITY Act. :… pic.twitter.com/CmdCcuU3xc — Congressman William Timmons (@RepTimmons) June 10, 2025 Timmons referenced a 2018 speech by William Hinman, then director of corporate finance at the SEC, in which Hinman stated that Bitcoin and ETH were not considered securities. That statement shaped the market’s understanding of Ether’s legal status for years. However, Timmons argued that the position shifted under Gensler. During an April 2023 congressional hearing, Gensler repeatedly declined to say whether the SEC considered ETH a security. According to the letter, just days before that hearing, the agency had approved a formal investigation titled “In the Matter of ETH 2.0.” The letter claims that the SEC’s refusal to confirm ETH’s classification while secretly opening a probe further clouded the situation. The agency later closed that investigation in June 2024, shortly after it approved spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in May , an action Timmons said would only be appropriate if ETH is *not* a security. “These inconsistent actions have caused destabilizing confusion for millions of American crypto-market participants,” Timmons said. He added that releasing the documents “is essential to ensuring that the digital asset industry, and the American public, understand the SEC’s historical approach.” Timmons requested specific emails and documents, including internal SEC communications discussing Ethereum 2.0 and its classification under the Howey test. Many of these documents were previously identified in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by History Associates on behalf of Coinbase in 2023. The SEC denied that FOIA request, citing exemptions. Coinbase then sued the agency in June 2024, prompting a judge to order the release of some records. Thousands of pages have since been made public, including one email that revealed prosecutors in New York had unsuccessfully asked the SEC for its official stance on ETH. Timmons argues that the continued lack of transparency reinforces concerns about the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation. “It will also bring transparency to the shadow ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach that, for years under the prior administration, hindered innovation and growth across the crypto industry,” he wrote. The SEC has yet to publicly respond to the latest request. Debate Over ETH’s Classification Heats Up as Congress Pushes for Clarity Timmons’ request comes as the industry continues to grapple with the unresolved question: is Ethereum a security or a commodity? The answer holds sweeping implications, not only for exchanges listing ETH, but also for Ethereum-based projects, recently approved ETH ETFs, and broader DeFi innovation. If ETH is deemed a security, SEC registration would become mandatory, triggering regulatory chaos. If not, oversight would shift to the CFTC, aligning Ethereum with Bitcoin’s regulatory path. Timmons argues that the stakes are too high for secrecy. In his letter, he urged transparency around the SEC’s shifting stance on ETH under Chair Gary Gensler , highlighting the need for Congress and the public to understand the agency’s reasoning. His call reflects broader frustration with the SEC’s enforcement-first approach, which critics say has relied on outdated interpretations of the Howey Test and failed to provide consistent guidance. The release of the Vaughn indices, now public via Coinbase, confirms the SEC has long held internal discussions on ETH’s classification. And with momentum building behind the bipartisan CLARITY Act , designed to formally define digital assets and split regulatory authority, Timmons’ push could mark the beginning of long-overdue reform. The industry may finally be edging closer to the regulatory clarity it has long demanded. The post Rep.

2025-06-11T15:20:26,"US China Trade Deal Breakthrough: Potential Impact on Global Markets and Crypto","BitcoinWorld US China Trade Deal Breakthrough: Potential Impact on Global Markets and Crypto News broke recently regarding a significant development on the international stage: a US China Trade Deal has reportedly been agreed upon in principle. This potential breakthrough, following intense negotiations in London, could signal a shift in the complex economic relationship between the world’s two largest economies. While the details are still emerging, this development has implications that ripple across traditional finance and, potentially, the cryptocurrency market. What Does a US China Trade Deal ‘In Principle’ Mean? According to a report by Watcher Guru on X, representatives from the United States and China reached this agreement after two days of talks. An agreement ‘in principle’ typically means the broad framework and key points have been settled, but the final text still needs to be formalized, reviewed, and signed. It’s a crucial step, but not the absolute final one. For years, trade tensions between the two nations have created uncertainty in global markets. Tariffs, trade barriers, and disputes over technology and intellectual property have been recurring themes. A comprehensive trade pact aims to address some of these long-standing issues, potentially leading to a more predictable and stable trading environment. How Could This Deal Shape Global Economic Stability? The relationship between the US and China is central to Global Economic Stability . When these two economic powerhouses are at odds, it creates ripples felt worldwide: Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs and trade restrictions can complicate international supply chains, increasing costs and reducing efficiency for businesses everywhere. Reduced Investment: Uncertainty discourages businesses from investing in expansion or new ventures that rely on international trade. Currency Volatility: Trade disputes can sometimes spill over into currency markets, adding another layer of risk. Slower Growth: Ultimately, unresolved trade tensions can act as a drag on global economic growth. An agreement, even in principle, offers the hope of alleviating some of these pressures. A stable trade relationship can foster greater predictability, encourage cross-border investment, and support overall economic expansion. This enhanced stability is often viewed positively by financial markets. What Does This Mean for Investor Sentiment? Investor Sentiment is highly sensitive to geopolitical and economic developments. Trade wars, by their nature, create fear and uncertainty, often leading investors to become more cautious. News of potential resolution, like a US China Trade Deal, can have the opposite effect. Positive shifts in investor sentiment often manifest as: Increased confidence in future economic prospects. Greater willingness to invest in riskier assets. Reduced demand for traditional ‘safe-haven’ assets (like certain government bonds). A general uplift in market indices. While this deal is only ‘in principle,’ the news itself can provide a temporary boost to sentiment, reflecting optimism that a major source of global economic friction might be easing. Decoding the Market Impact: Traditional vs. Crypto The immediate Market Impact of such news is typically seen in traditional financial markets. Stock markets, particularly those with significant exposure to international trade or companies heavily involved in US-China business, often react positively to de-escalation in trade tensions. Commodity prices, sensitive to global demand and supply chain issues, can also be affected. But what about the Cryptocurrency Outlook ? The relationship between macro-economic events and the crypto market is complex and debated. Here are a few perspectives: Crypto as a Risk-On Asset: If a trade deal boosts global economic confidence and investor sentiment, some argue that capital might flow into assets perceived as higher risk, including cryptocurrencies, in search of greater returns. Crypto as a Hedge/Safe Haven: Conversely, during periods of high geopolitical or economic uncertainty (like trade wars), some investors turn to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as potential hedges against traditional financial instability or currency devaluation. If a trade deal *reduces* this uncertainty, the perceived need for such hedges might decrease, potentially leading to outflows. Correlation with Traditional Markets: In recent years, the crypto market, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, has shown increasing correlation with traditional stock indices. If a trade deal causes a rally in stocks, crypto might follow suit, regardless of its safe-haven narrative. Focus on Fundamentals: Ultimately, the long-term cryptocurrency outlook is driven by its own adoption, technological developments, regulatory environment, and network effects, independent of specific trade deals. Therefore, while a US China Trade Deal could influence short-term market movements through shifts in sentiment and liquidity, its long-term effect on the fundamental value and adoption of cryptocurrencies remains less direct and depends on a confluence of factors. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for market reactions, what should crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Monitor official announcements regarding the trade deal. The details matter, and an agreement ‘in principle’ is not the final word. Observe Market Reactions: Watch how both traditional markets and the crypto market react in the hours and days following the news. Pay attention to trading volumes and price movements. Understand Correlation: Be aware of the current correlation between crypto and traditional assets. This can help anticipate potential movements. Maintain Perspective: While macro events can cause volatility, remember your long-term investment strategy based on the fundamentals of the crypto projects you support.

2025-06-11T15:20:21,"BNB Pushes Higher Despite Market Turbulence, Testing Resistance Near $674","Binance’s BNB token moved higher in the last 24 hours, defying broad market unease driven by geopolitical and economic crosswinds. The coin gained 1.75%, rising from $659.72 to $670.91, as investors monitored resistance levels near $674 for signs of a breakout. The token’s performance comes amid the backdrop of a U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showing inflation came in lower than expected in May, boosting risk asset prices, with the S&P 500 moving up 0.3% in today’s session so far, and the NASDAQ rising 0.4%. Meanwhile, CoinDesk 20, a broader digital assets market gauge, rose 2.6% in the last 24 hours. BNB has been posting higher lows that suggest accumulating interest even as volatility persists. Bitcoin, the market’s bellwether, is hovering around $109,800 after bouncing back from last week’s retreat. On-chain data shows growing wallet activity consistent with accumulation phases, hinting that long-term holders may be taking advantage of dips. Technical Analysis Overview BNB traded within a narrow $8.12 range on the day, with buying pressure being strongest between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. Volume during this window exceeded the 24-hour average of 41,757 tokens, supporting the upward move. Despite testing resistance around $673.67 several times without success, the token held support near $667.50. A sharp two-minute correction at one point briefly knocked the price from $669.87 to $667.35 on heavy volume. However, it quickly stabilized, potentially suggesting the sell-off lacked conviction. BNB is now floating above $670, maintaining a bullish structure defined by higher lows. Traders now look for a clean break above $674 for a potential signal for the next leg higher.
