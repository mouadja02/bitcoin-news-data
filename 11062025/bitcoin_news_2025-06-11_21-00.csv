2025-06-11T18:52:07,"Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan Makes Key Statement on the Cryptocurrency Industry","Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan announced that they are preparing to issue a cryptocurrency (stablecoin) tied to the US dollar if the legal infrastructure is provided. The CEO said, “It will be a stablecoin, quite clearly. It will be completely backed by the dollar… it is no different than a bank account.” On the other hand, it was noted in the interview that cryptocurrencies and digital strategies were also evaluated in terms of the global competitiveness of the United States. Comments that Bitcoin could be considered a strategic asset and that there was a consensus on this issue in some units of the US military were also included in the interview. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Unleashes Listing Storm - Announcements Coming One After Another - Here's the Latest Altcoin They've Chosen The interview also noted that, contrary to critics such as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's approach to crypto investments as a waste of resources, some generals in the US military have emphasized the importance of strategic digital assets such as Bitcoin, especially in Southeast Asia. Compared to companies like JP Morgan and Citigroup, Bank of America has been cautious about entering the crypto space, but changing regulations could change the bank’s stance. The Trump administration has made it clear that it will support all efforts in the crypto space. This support will come in part through clearer regulatory guidelines, which will increase competition among Wall Street banks in the sector. Charles Schwab, another bank that had previously been hesitant in the field, has opened a position as head of digital assets to evaluate opportunities in the field. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T18:49:11,"Bitcoin price target: rally to $111k likely as soft CPI print fuels rate cut talks","Bitcoin is entering a period of volatility, as macro effects align for a short-term rally to $111,000, according to Bitfinex Head of Derivatives Jag Kooner. Macro factors, including a potential U.S.– China trade deal and cooler-than-expected inflation figures, are aligning to support another Bitcoin (BTC) ally. On Wednesday, June 11, Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, shared his insights on Bitcoin with crypto.news. Kooner believes that a possible agreement between the U.S. and China could help reduce uncertainty and boost market sentiment. However, he noted that the optimism may already be priced in, meaning the immediate impact on markets could be limited. You might also like: Why are Bitcoin and crypto prices going up today? Instead, the most likely near-term effect is increased volatility. The same applies to the latest inflation reading, which rose just 0.1% on a monthly basis. Together, these developments suggest that Bitcoin may be setting up for significant price action in the near future, according to Kooner. “Core CPI up 0.1% m/m firms up rate cut bets, compresses real yields, and creates a vacuum above $111K for bitcoin. That move would likely be spot-driven, with ETF demand accelerating as the macro regime shifts toward easing,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex. You might also like: Bitcoin is key to fighting inflation, says billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones Bitcoin to reach $111K: Bitfinex analyst Lower inflation could increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, potentially giving Bitcoin a boost. According to Kooner, this theme could dominate crypto market sentiment over the next two weeks, possibly pushing Bitcoin toward $111,000, close to its all-time high. “BTC’s tight correlation with the S&P 500 (30D r ~0.63) reveals its current role as a liquidity barometer rather than a volatility hedge. This correlation makes BTC highly sensitive to SPX range-bound conditions, and until the index breaks out, BTC’s upside remains constrained,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex. Still, Bitcoin’s upside remains tied to stock market performance. The strong correlation with equities means that any breakout may depend on the S&P 500 moving out of its current range. If that happens, both Bitcoin and altcoins could move sharply higher, offering gains for crypto holders. Read more: Will Bitcoin continue rising?

2025-06-11T18:49:00,"Watch out for these crypto stocks outperforming your Bitcoin and altcoin bags","Bitcoin rallied past the $110,500 level on Monday. The largest crypto is down nearly 2% as bullish momentum slowly fades. Interestingly, US crypto-linked stocks rose alongside Bitcoin and are currently consolidating alongside the largest crypto. Crypto stocks posted double-digit gains in the past month even as Bitcoin ( BTC ) yielded a modest increase of under 4%. In this deep dive we compare the performance of crypto stocks, Bitcoin and altcoins and examine the profitability of the sector in a traders’ portfolio. Table of Contents US crypto stocks vs. Bitcoin performance Nasdaq newcomer takes a hit this week US crypto stocks are attracting inflows and interest Bitcoin price analysis US crypto stocks vs. Bitcoin performance Crypto-linked stocks in the US kicked off the week with a rally alongside Bitcoin. BTC tested resistance above the $110,500 level and started consolidating, crypto-linked mining stocks and stocks of major crypto firms wiped their recent gains on Tuesday. More corporates adopted Saylor’s strategy of adding Bitcoin to their treasury, and Circle made a stellar IPO debut on Nasdaq last week. These developments are key catalysts driving Bitcoin’s gains and the rise in US crypto stocks. Circle Internet Group (CRCL), one of the largest stablecoin issuers, wiped out nearly 8% on the day, down to $106.62. The stock erased its Monday days nearly entirely. Core Scientific Inc. (CORZ), CleanSpark Inc. (CLSK), and MARA Holdings Inc. (MARA), key crypto mining stocks, observed small changes in their price on Tuesday. CORZ is down 0.12%, CLSK is up 0.10%, and MARA gained 0.25% on the day. Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) gained 0.60% on Tuesday. Bitcoin slipped closer to its support at $108,000 on the day, as crypto stocks continued their consolidation. Bitcoin’s correlation to the S&P 500 has recently dropped, which supports a thesis of equity investors choosing to gain exposure to crypto through stocks, instead of direct access to tokens that entails the risk of custody and security. Bitcoin and S&P 500 correlation | Source: 10xResearch.com The decline in crypto stocks like CRCL, Coinbase (COIN), KULR Technology Group Inc. (KULR), and Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) presents an opportunity for sidelined buyers to consider adding crypto stocks to their portfolio, and balance against their crypto token holdings this cycle. If Bitcoin’s correlation with S&P 500 weakens further, it is likely that crypto stocks outperform BTC and altcoin holdings this cycle. You might also like: Will Bitcoin continue rising?

The demand for exchange stocks, Bitcoin mining stocks, and stablecoin issuer Circle’s CRCL keeps rising. Bitcoin’s rising hashrate has increased the competition between miners, and regulations like the GENIUS Act support a pro-crypto environment for further growth in crypto stocks. Analysts at 10xResearch believe that the rise in Robinhood’s crypto revenue and Coinbase’s stock being undervalued at the time of writing is a sign of a structural shift in the market. Retail investors eyeing a piece of Bitcoin are likely attracted to crypto stocks, in light of higher regulatory clarity on holding and taxation of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin price is less than 2% away from its all-time high of $111,980. A re-test of the previous all-time high and a daily candlestick close above this level could push BTC into price discovery. The BTC/USDT price chart shows $122,172, the 127.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally from the April low of $74,500 to the all-time high could be the next target for Bitcoin. Technical indicators, RSI and MACD support further gains in Bitcoin. RSI reads 62, above average but under the overvalued level at 70. MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral level, meaning that the underlying momentum in Bitcoin price trend is positive. BTC/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Bitcoin is 11% away from the 127.2% Fibonacci retracement level and BTC could find support at $106,488, the lower boundary of the FVG on the daily price chart. Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler told Crypto.news in a written note that there is a strong possibility that Bitcoin hits a new all-time high. Lienkha said, “…As the price currently stands just a few percentage points below its previous peak. Broadly speaking, financial markets remain optimistic. The S&P 500, for example, is trading approximately 3% below its all-time high. However, the risk of a reversal remains, particularly if upcoming economic data disappoints.

2025-06-11T18:48:18,"HB7082 Enacted: Connecticut Prohibits Crypto in State Treasury","Connecticut has made a bold move to distance itself from government cryptocurrency involvement by unanimously passing House Bill 7082, now known as Public Act No. 25-66. This marks the country’s most expansive state-level prohibition on crypto-related government activity. Connecticut Shuts Door on State-Backed Crypto Projects The new law bars all state and municipal bodies from establishing cryptocurrency reserves or accepting digital assets as payment for taxes, fees, or any financial obligations. This sweeping action effectively halts any future state-supported crypto projects in Connecticut. In addition to the investment ban, the legislation outlines rigorous consumer protections for virtual currency service providers. Companies involved in money transmission must prominently display warnings that transactions are irreversible and that losses from fraud or errors may be unrecoverable. They are also required to disclose all material risks to customers and verify the identity of users under the age of 18. The legislation also revises the state’s broader financial oversight laws and introduces new definitions surrounding key digital finance terms such as digital wallets, kiosks, and control persons. Moreover, it compels crypto businesses licensed in Connecticut to implement enhanced compliance programs that meet new state standards. This hardline stance contrasts sharply with the growing number of states actively pursuing digital asset adoption. Bitcoin Laws data reveals that 31 states are currently considering Bitcoin reserve bills. Of them, 16 have advanced while 8 rejected similar measures. While some of those rejections may still be revisited, Connecticut’s legislation is significant for the breadth and decisiveness of its restrictions. First in the Nation Last month, New Hampshire officially became the first US state to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. On May 6, Governor Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 302 into law, which allowed the state treasury to invest up to 5% of its funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets with market capitalizations over $500 billion. Currently, only Bitcoin qualifies. The law, which is inspired by Satoshi Action’s policy framework, requires secure, US-regulated custody and aims to diversify reserves while upholding fiscal responsibility.

2025-06-11T18:41:53,"$230,000 Bitcoin Price ‘Fair Value’ Amid Likelihood of Sovereign Debt Default, According to Bitwise","Crypto asset manager Bitwise says the possibility of countries failing to repay their debts may drive Bitcoin ( BTC ) to an astronomical new all-time high. In a new report, Bitwise analysts say that growing debt levels of countries and the increasing odds of sovereign default may send Bitcoin to $230,000, a more than 110% increase from its current value, under the assumption that more investors will pour into the flagship crypto asset as a hedge. “As we have pointed out in our latest monthly report as well, Bitcoin can provide an alternative ‘portfolio insurance’ against widespread sovereign defaults as a scarce decentralized asset which is free of counterparty risks. Quantitative models estimate Bitcoin’s hypothetical ‘fair value’ amid the current sovereign default probabilities at around $230,000 today. This estimation is dovetailed by Bitcoin’s increasing scarcity which also points to an ascent towards $200,000 by the end of the year.” Bitwise also suggests that the United States’ mounting debt level may lead to debasement of the dollar, potentially making Bitcoin a more attractive asset to park wealth. “We also expect that the US fiscal debt situation will most likely continue to deteriorate over the coming years which is also the official projection by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO): net interest expenses will likely triple towards the end of this decade already – from ~$1 trillion to ~$3 trillion by the year 2030. Non-discretionary government outlays – i.e. those that are mandatory and required by law, such as interest expenses, social security, unemployment insurance etc. – already exceed 100% of fiscal revenues. The proposed tax cuts by the Trump administration will likely exacerbate this situation.” Bitcoin is trading for $109,467 at time of writing.

2025-06-11T18:41:10,"Ukraine Lawmakers Introduce Historic Bill For Establishment Of Crypto Asset Reserve","Eight Ukrainian lawmakers submitted a draft bill that would authorize the country’s National Bank to add cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to the country’s reserve. Submitted to Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, on Tuesday, bill number 13356 proposes amendments to the law “On the National Bank of Ukraine” regarding the addition of crypto assets to the traditional reserves, including gold and foreign currencies. Yaroslav Zheleznyak, who sponsored the bill, serves as first deputy chairman of the Committee on Finance, Tax and Customs Policy. In a post on Telegram, Zheleznyak described the bill as a “step [to] integrate Ukraine into global financial innovations.” However, he noted that the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) would retain full control over whether, how much, and when to allocate a portion of its reserves to crypto. “How, when and how much should be the decision of the regulator itself,” Zhelezniak wrote. Crypto Reserves To Strengthen Macroeconomic Stability Zheleznyak clarified that if the bill became law, the policy would not demand the NBU to acquire crypto as part of state reserves; it would only have the option of doing so. Nonetheless, the lawmaker asserted that creating a crypto reserve would integrate Ukraine into global financial innovations. “Proper management of crypto reserves will help strengthen macroeconomic stability and create new opportunities for the development of the digital economy,” he explained. Ukraine already holds 46,351 BTC, valued at over $5 billion, a figure trailing the holdings of the U.S., China, and the U.K., according to data tracked by BiTBO. Global Crypto Reserve Spree In 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender and establish a BTC reserve. The Latin American nation has continued accumulating the maiden crypto for its reserve despite efforts by the International Monetary Fund to freeze crypto acquisitions. In the United States, President Donald Trump earlier this year signed an Executive Order paving the way for a “digital Fort Knox” strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate Digital Asset stockpile. Other countries, such as the Czech Republic , Brazil, and Pakistan , have also been moving towards integrating digital currencies into their financial systems. The bill’s passing would put Ukraine on this ever-growing list of nations mulling the future of crypto assets.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ukraine-lawmakers-introduce-historic-bill-for-establishment-of-crypto-asset-reserve/,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News|ukraine",cryptocompare

2025-06-11T18:37:38,"20x-leveraged whale bet lifts Bitcoin back above $108K","The anonymous wallet opened the bet on Binance Futures, sparking a short squeeze and reviving bullish sentiment. Is this the Most Daring Bitcoin Move of the Year? A newly funded wallet, '0x1f25,' made one of 2025’s boldest moves—taking a 511.5 BTC position on Hyperliquid using $10M USDC margin and 20x leverage at $106,538 entry, risking liquidation at $88,141. Based on this investment of $54.5 million with 20 times leverage, the whale made a very risky bet by borrowing money to make a much bigger Bitcoin trade than they actually had. This bold move has thrusted Bitcoin upwards, with the apex cryptocurrency being a stone’s throw away from the psychological price of $110,000. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin was hovering around the $109,238 level, representing a 3.3% increase in the past week, according to CoinGecko data . This Bitcoin rally aligns with optimism over US-China trade talks in London, which could ease tech export curbs and boost access to rare earth minerals. Risk assets, including US stocks, surged in response, lifting BTC higher. Bitcoin’s Demand in the U.S. Skyrockets Bitcoin demand in the US is surging, with Coinbase Premium hitting a 4-month high — a clear sign that investor sentiment is turning bullish and the market is heating up. Coinbase Premium is a metric that compares the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase to the price of Bitcoin on other global exchanges, such as Binance. Therefore, a high Coinbase Premium indicates strong buying interest from US-based investors since they’re willing to pay a bit more than the global average to get Bitcoin. What does this mean? Well, US-based investors are increasingly eager to buy Bitcoin, evidenced by them paying higher prices on Coinbase than on other exchanges. This shift in sentiment points to rising enthusiasm and suggests the market could be preparing for a stronger move upward. Meanwhile, a supply shock looms since Bitcoin on crypto exchanges recently hit a 7-year low, which is bullish because of dwindling selling pressure. Bitcoin’s Battle: Will ATH Resistance Become the Next Bullish Launchpad or a Stubborn Barrier?” Having set a new all-time high of $111,814 last month on May 22, Bitcoin stands just shy of this level at $109,238. Whether it can flip $112K into support depends on its ability to hold $106K–107K on pullbacks, combined with a dovish U.S. macro backdrop. Should these align, Bitcoin may not only breach $112K again but sustain higher levels—potentially eyeing the $120K zone next. But failure to secure these key levels risks reversing into a broader correction, with $100K or deeper revisits becoming likely. Technical structure, on‑chain strength, and institutional interest all favor bulls, but macro economics and pattern risks caution against assuming victory. The $103–112 K range is critical because if Bitcoin holds and flips, it opens the door to new highs. Conclusion At $109,238, Bitcoin seems to be in a consolidation phase, often called the ”calm before the storm” needed to elevate it past the $112,000 zone. This might be the reason why the anyonymous whale made a 20x leverage bet, expecting the leading cryptocurrency to make a new ATH soon. As investor sentiment skyrockets led by those on American soil, time will tell how BTC plays out in the short term as fingers remain crossed on whether a breach past $112K is in the offing.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9537/20x-leveraged-whale-bet-lifts-bitcoin-back-above-108-k,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|ZRX","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T18:33:03,"Europe’s Bitcoin Ambitions Grow as Blockchain Group Plans $340M Treasury Boost","Paris-based Blockchain Group is making a strong push into Bitcoin, with plans to raise $340 million to grow its crypto holdings. The move is one of the boldest yet by a European firm, and it signals that institutional interest in Bitcoin isn’t limited to the U.S. Blockchain Group already holds more than $154 million in BTC, but this new raise would more than double its treasury, positioning the company as a key player in the European crypto space. Unsplash The way they’re raising funds sets them apart. Modeled after the At-The-Market (ATM) approach seen in U.S. financial markets, the company will sell shares directly at market prices in controlled tranches. Instead of unloading all the shares at once, they’ll be released gradually based on pricing limits that include the higher of the previous day’s close or the average market price, and capped at 21% of that day’s trading volume. That makes it a flexible, cautious way to fund expansion without shaking up the stock price. It’s not just about holding more Bitcoin, but it’s about treating Bitcoin as a central financial strategy. With that in mind, Blockchain Group has teamed up with TOBAM, a well-known asset manager in France. TOBAM will manage the capital raise and guide the incoming funds into growth-focused plans. This kind of structured, institutional cooperation hasn’t been common in the European crypto scene, but it reflects a growing belief that Bitcoin can be a serious long-term asset, not just a bet on price. You can see similar shifts in consumer-facing markets, too, with crypto now being used in a variety of everyday settings, such as online casinos, where this crypto usage helps to ensure players’ data privacy as well as faster withdrawal speeds of winnings. (Source: https://www.pokerstrategy.com/online-casinos/bitcoin-casinos/ ) Bitcoin is becoming a practical currency option, not just a speculative store of value. When Bitcoin starts popping up in places where people actually spend money, it helps support the idea that it’s something that could stick, and not just a trend for traders. This approach is part of a broader strategic plan laid out by Blockchain Group leadership. Alexandre Laizet, the company’s deputy CEO and head of Bitcoin operations, has been upfront about the direction they’re heading. He sees the ATM raise not just as a way to buy more Bitcoin but as a tool to grow beyond European markets. According to Laizet, the company isn’t chasing the market because it’s focused on results and using Bitcoin as a long-term source of value. Valentin Kosanovic, another executive, echoed that sentiment. He called the move a major leap in the company’s global strategy and stressed their dedication to Bitcoin as a core business driver. That’s a potential signal that Blockchain Group is aiming to build a sustained presence in the space and not just grab headlines or chase short-term gains. The timing of this announcement is interesting, too. Just days before they put it out, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, called MicroStrategy , unveiled plans to raise $1 billion to expand its own BTC holdings. While Blockchain Group’s raise is smaller, it carries weight because of what it represents: Europe’s entrance into a field that’s largely been dominated by U.S. players. Strategy currently holds more than 2.7% of the total Bitcoin supply, valued at over $61 billion. Blockchain Group isn’t at that level yet, but this new raise brings them closer to that conversation. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have been seeing net outflows. Over $47 million left those funds on June 6 alone, marking a second straight day of selling. Despite that, firms like Blockchain Group are pressing ahead. They’re not reacting to short-term market dips. They’re acting on what they see as a long-term opportunity. Analysts say this kind of treasury-based accumulation is a bullish sign . It shows that some institutions believe the future of Bitcoin doesn’t rest on day-to-day price swings. After hitting an all-time high of $111,814 on May 22, Bitcoin has been consolidating. Still, many in the industry are pointing to the lack of forced selling or leveraged blowouts as a sign of stability. Blockchain Group’s move fits into that narrative. Rather than panic during a cooldown, they’re buying. And they’re doing it through careful, structured raises that aim to protect their balance sheet while strengthening their position in crypto. Unsplash While a lot of attention still focuses on North America, Europe is starting to play catch-up. And if Blockchain Group’s strategy pays off, it could mark a turning point. The company is putting itself in a position not just to grow, but to lead. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-11T18:14:43,"Bitcoin Poised For Rally To $1 Million, Says Michael Saylor — Here’s What Will Catalyze The Epic Ascent","Michael Saylor, cofounder and the executive chairman of Bitcoin-powered giant Strategy, has ruled out the chances of a full-blown crypto winter returning, at least not anytime soon. Crypto winter, as widely known within the cryptosphere, is a period typically characterized by a cruel correction in Bitcoin prices. According to Saylor, BTC is not going to $0 but is headed towards the $1 million per coin coveted milestone based on a number of key factors that he believes will supercharge the price of the oldest cryptocurrency. Price Has To Rocket If $50 Million In Bitcoin Is Bought Daily Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Michael Saylor highlighted that roughly 450 Bitcoin (BTC) are minted by miners every day. At current Bitcoin prices of $109,559 as per CoinGecko, that amount is equivalent to around $50 million. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” Saylor posited. The Bitcoin bull further noted that the increasing number of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is buying “the entire natural supply.” Saylor’s software intelligence-turned Bitcoin Treasury firm Strategy has amassed 582,000 BTC since it started purchasing in 2020, which is valued at around $63.59 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” Notably, Saylor acknowledged that if Bitcoin surges to $500,000 or $1 million, it may be more realistic to expect it to fall by about $200,000 a coin. Trump Endorsement Another Key Tailwind According to Saylor, there are enough confirmations in the wider economy to support his all-or-nothing prediction for Bitcoin. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” the Strategy co-founder quipped. Saylor also pointed out that US President Trump’s backing of Bitcoin and his efforts to create a more friendly regulatory environment will buoy the asset’s uptrend. Meanwhile, traditional banks have started to leverage this improving regulatory scene to foray into the fast-growing market, as they prepare to provide BTC custody services. Growing Institutional Bitcoin Adoption He further pointed out that demand for the scarce asset is going through the roof. For instance, BlackRock and other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers and nation states are buying up Bitcoin daily. Bilal Bin Saqib, head of Pakistan’s crypto council, recently disclosed that the country is set to create its own United States-esque strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor described the growing demand for Bitcoin as a “digital gold rush,” suggesting the top crypto has “gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected.” It’s worth mentioning that Saylor is not the only uber-bullish pundit in the crypto market. As ZyCrypto previously reported , asset manager ARK Invest bumped its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, bolstered mainly by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as “digital gold.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-poised-for-rally-to-1-million-says-michael-saylor-heres-what-will-catalyze-the-epic-ascent/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare
2025-06-11T18:13:08,"What to Expect for Bitcoin Following the Inflation Data Shock in the US and Trump’s Statements on China? Here Are Expert Opinions","With inflation in the US remaining below expectations, the Bitcoin (BTC) price remained stable in the $110,000 band. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May increased by 2.4% on an annual basis, while headline inflation rose for the first time since January, while the overall inflation trend continued to slow. Core inflation remained stable at 2.8%. Financial markets showed limited reaction to the data, with Bitcoin trading in the $109,600-$110,100 range, while U.S. stocks continued their volatile course with a slight increase. Nansen Chief Research Analyst Aurelie Barthere said the current data will have limited impact on the market. “This data is not expected to create a strong movement in the markets,” Barthere said, arguing that US-China trade talks have become a more important macro factor. “The progress or setbacks in these talks could be decisive for risk assets.” Related News: Caution: Well-known app Accused of Seizing Cryptocurrency from Users Who Have Not Moved Their Assets for a Year Ahead of the CPI data, President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that a new tariff agreement between the US and China has been completed and only formalities remain. Trump also called on the Fed to cut interest rates by a full percentage point. Nic Puckrin, founder of Coin Bureau, said that falling inflation and “exaggerated” tariff concerns could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates. “I expect inflation to continue to trend downward throughout the year. This could give the Fed confidence to cut interest rates,” Puckrin said, adding that this could trigger Bitcoin’s final bullish phase of this cycle. “With almost half of the year behind us, the inflation monster still remains in its cage despite all the pessimistic forecasts,” he added. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-11T18:11:32,"Trump Family-Backed American Bitcoin Has Scooped Up $23 Million Worth Of Bitcoin","American Bitcoin, Hut 8’s majority-owned Bitcoin-mining unit backed by the Trump family, has accumulated 215 BTC since its launch in April, according to a recent disclosure from the company to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the June 6 SEC filing, the digital asset mining firm revealed it was holding 215 Bitcoin in its reserves as of May 31. Based on current prices, the stash is worth $23.6 million. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin was changing hands at $109,605 at publication time . This marks the company’s first sizable Bitcoin acquisition since announcing a Bitcoin treasury play, pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy — which started accumulating BTC in 2020. American Data Center, owned by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., merged with Bitcoin mining company Hut8 to form American Bitcoin in March. The Trump brothers own 20% of American Bitcoin, while Hut 8 holds the remaining 80%. The newly established entity plans to go public as early as the third financial quarter of this year through a stock-for-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining and will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ABTC. “ABTC considers its reserve a core strategic asset, managed adaptively to support balance sheet strength with a view to enhancing long-term stockholder value. Bitcoin accumulation is not a side effect of ABTC’s business. It is the business,” the firm said. The company added that its accumulation strategy is open-ended, suggesting that it has no fixed BTC target. Instead, it will continuously assess market conditions to raise capital when favorable and boost its holdings of the foremost cryptocurrency. American Bitcoin’s strategy to grow its Bitcoin stash comes as a slew of public and private companies increasingly add the asset to their corporate treasuries. Companies including Trump Media , GameStop , and Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain became the latest to announce or advance their Bitcoin treasuries, joining the likes of Semler Scientific , Cantor-backed Twenty One , and Metaplanet . Though American Bitcoin is separate from the Trump Organization, it may eventually team up with World Liberty Financial — the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform launched by Trump’s eldest sons late last year.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trump-family-backed-american-bitcoin-has-scooped-up-23-million-worth-of-bitcoin/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump",cryptocompare

In a new interview on Bloomberg Television, the Tudor Investment Corporation founder says that the US government is in a debt trap, and will need to run negative real rates – or set interest rates lower than the rate of inflation, in order to devalue its debt. Jones says that the “playbook is clear” as far as what the government is going to need to do, giving an edge to investors looking to position themselves. Besides stocks, he mentions Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold as portfolio staples moving forward. “We’re going to have negative real rates and that’s why you have to think about what is facing our policy makers in this debt trap as you construct your portfolio. So, what would an ideal portfolio be in something like that? Well, what has worked so far? What has worked so far has been some combination of stocks – which won’t do great, which would do terribly if they called us out on the bond market… But it would be some combination of probably volatility-adjusted Bitcoin, gold, stocks. That’s probably your best portfolio to fight inflation.” The investor also said he believes that President Trump will attempt to install a new Fed Chair who is “uber dovish” in order to get rates down and achieve the desired market environment. At time of writing, both BTC and gold are just slightly below their all-time highs.

2025-06-11T18:00:00,"Torn Between Pepe and Pepeto? Here’s Why Pepeto Could Be the Hottest Token This Summer","In the crypto space, it is common knowledge that altcoins tend to spark activity once Bitcoin gains upward momentum. And right now, two meme coins keep popping up: Pepe and Pepeto. Pepe had its big moment, but now Pepeto is stealing the spotlight with its innovative ecosystem and a presale that’s already raising millions. Just think of Pepeto as an improved version of Pepe, not a copycat. If you missed Pepe’s debut rise last year, you might have another chance with Pepeto. What Makes Pepeto Stand Out? If you’re familiar with the cryptocurrency space, you’ll know that Pepe was the king of meme-coins. However, Pepeto rose to fix some of its problems. Unlike Pepe, which has unlimited coins, Pepeto burns 5% of every transaction, making the remaining coins more valuable over time. Additionally, Pepeto isn’t just a meme; it’s building a play-to-earn game with NFT rewards, so it has real-world use. Imagine it this way: Pepe = Fun meme, but no plans after the hype. Pepeto = Fun meme plus games, rewards, and an innovative ecosystem to keep growing. Pepeto’s Presale: Why’s Everyone Talking About It? The Pepeto presale has been gaining momentum for several months, and savvy investors are jumping in early as it gradually nears its end. Right now, you can purchase Pepeto tokens for $0.000000133 each. However, this price won’t last long, as the presale has already raised over $5.3 million, indicating that people believe in this project. From observation, these are three big things that make Pepeto special: The price goes up at every stage Major exchanges like KuCoin will list it soon Players can earn tokens by playing the new mobile game A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 From these observations, Pepeto could blow up the same way Pepe did, but with even better features. Currently, they’re burning tokens (making yours more valuable) and creating NFT rewards. And the best part? You’re getting in before everyone else. Once the presale ends and it hits big exchanges, early buyers could see massive gains. Don’t wait. Join the presale now. Why It’s Time for The Pepe Legacy to Move On Pepe the Frog was the meme coin king of 2023, as it shocked everyone with its incredible rise. At its all-time high, early investors made life-changing profits. However, here’s the truth about Pepe today: The significant gains have already happened- Pepe’s price is now 70% below its all-time high Whales control too much- Just 5% of holders own 60% of all coins No real utility- It’s just a meme with no games, rewards, or plans Pepe proved that meme coins could explode, and as a result, big traders saw this as an avenue to manipulate prices. The token has an unlimited supply (no burns), and the developers have moved on to new projects. Pepe had its moment, but investors are now looking for the next opportunity, one with actual growth potential. That’s exactly what Pepeto offers, which is all the viral energy of early Pepe but with smart tokenomics and real use cases. Click here to join the presale. About Pepeto Pepeto is the future of meme coins, as it combines viral fun with real utility. Unlike standard meme tokens, Pepto features automatic token burns (5% of every transaction) to increase scarcity over time. The project is developing a play-to-earn mobile game and an NFT rewards system, providing holders with opportunities to earn beyond just trading. Founded by experienced Web3 developers, the Pepeto team is entirely public and has passed security audits. Pepeto’s goal is to create a meme coin that lasts, not just pumps and dumps. With upcoming major exchange listings and an active community, Pepeto aims to be the meme coin of summer 2025.

2025-06-11T17:47:38,"Pepe price due for a healthy pullback after 30% rally","Pepe has seen a sharp 30% rally after establishing a significant market low at the recent swing point. While momentum remains bullish, the memecoin is now approaching a major confluence of resistance that could prompt a temporary correction before further upside continuation. Pepe’s ( PEPE ) recent rally has been impressive, posting a clean 30% gain off a well-defined swing low. However, price is now testing a critical resistance cluster, which includes the point of control (POC), a high-timeframe horizontal resistance, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level from the previous decline. This area is technically significant and often associated with distribution or profit-taking zones. Key technical points 30% Rally from Swing Low: PEPE has rebounded strongly from a key support, marking a potential trend shift. Major Resistance Confluence Ahead: Price is now testing the POC, 0.618 Fibonacci, and high-timeframe resistance zone. Correction May Be Healthy: A rejection here would align with normal bullish structure, potentially forming a higher low. PEPEUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView From a technical perspective, the area PEPE is entering now acts as a natural resistance zone, where buyers may begin to slow down and profit-taking could emerge. This resistance band is reinforced by: The point of control, where the most volume has traded historically, A macro 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, a key reversal level in trending markets, And a high-timeframe horizontal resistance, which previously capped bullish momentum. Given the strength of the recent move, a pullback would be considered healthy, particularly if it results in a higher low forming near the last major breakout level. This would reinforce the current bullish structure and set the stage for a sustainable rally in the next leg up. You might also like: ADA, TON surge expose market weakness; BlockDAG’s X1 app sets new record with 1.5M users However, if the bullish momentum is particularly strong, there is still a chance PEPE breaks above this resistance cluster. In that case, bulls will need to push through the value area high, which would confirm a new swing high and shift the short-term outlook decisively in favor of continued upside. Until then, this region remains a critical decision zone where price must prove whether bulls are in full control, or if a rotation lower is required before the next leg. What to expect in the coming price action PEPE is now at a major crossroads. If bulls fail to break through the POC–0.618 resistance zone, a pullback toward high-timeframe support is the most likely outcome. This would allow for a healthy retest and potential higher low, keeping the uptrend intact. A breakout, however, would signal accelerating strength and continuation toward new highs.

This decision has helped calm global tensions and bring hope to the markets. Both countries agreed to return to the Pre-Liberation status quo . This means they will go back to the way things were before recent conflicts. Following this deal, the crypto market went up. Bitcoin (BTC) rose again to around $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) also grew strongly, reaching the $3,000 mark. US and China Reach Trade Deal Framework Talks that began on Monday led to an agreement by Wednesday, as officials from both the US and China confirmed they had found common ground. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the two countries had agreed on a basic framework that would begin once both presidents gave their final approval. He explained that the first step was to remove negativity so progress could follow. China’s Vice Minister of Commerce also said that both sides had settled on steps to implement the deal. Key parts of the agreement include China lifting limits on rare earth exports and the US easing some export bans. The deal will move forward once both Presidents review and approve it. Crypto Market Reacts Strongly The news of the truce sparked a strong reaction in the crypto market. The flagship crypto climbed higher , reaching near its all-time high. This price increase has sparked optimism among coin supporters with BTC up 2.2% to $109,572 On June 11, Strategy’s Chairman, Michael Saylor, said that the digital gold could reach the $1 million price mark, claiming the crypto winter is over. Ethereum increased by 5.5% in just 24 hours and is now trading at $2,772. Many traders believe it may soon cross the $3,000 level. Altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) coins also saw big gains. Some DeFi tokens recorded double-digit increases. If this trend continues, the total market value of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin, could rise from $857 billion to $1.7 trillion. Stock Market Also Shows Growth The optimism was not limited to cryptocurrencies. US stock markets also showed strong signs of growth. Dow futures grew by 100 points. Also, major stocks like Tesla rose 2.3% during pre-market trading on June 11. This strong crypto market response reflects investors’ renewed confidence in the crypto and financial market.

2025-06-11T17:25:14,"Bitcoin w rezerwie USA, a Bitcoin Hyper przyspiesza jego rozwój","Stany Zjednoczone oficjalnie rozpoczęły budowę Rezerwy Strategicznej Bitcoina, a Bitcoin Hyper($HYPER) wspiera rozwój warstwy drugiej króla kryptowalut. Nowa struktura powstała z inicjatywy administracji Donalda Trumpa, która zdecydowała się wykorzystać skonfiskowane środki w celu zabezpieczenia cyfrowych aktywów. Ten ruch nie wynika z przypadku. Z danych udostępnionych przez Gemini i Glassnode wynika, że ponad 30% całkowitej podaży BTC znajduje się w rękach scentralizowanych podmiotów. Wśród nich są fundusze ETF, giełdy kryptowalut, przedsiębiorstwa oraz rządy. W raporcie podkreślono, że zaangażowanie instytucji publicznych może mieć istotny wpływ na rozwój rynku. Każdy dolar wprowadzony przez państwowy kapitał przekłada się na wzrost wartości rynkowej w wysokości 25 dolarów. Co więcej, generuje 1,70 dolara trwałego wzrostu wartości sieci. Tego typu wpływ sygnalizuje coraz większe znaczenie strategicznych rezerw w świecie cyfrowych aktywów. Nowy sygnał dla inwestorów długoterminowych Bitcoin przestaje być kojarzony wyłącznie z aktywem spekulacyjnym. Wzrost liczby zasobów przenoszonych z giełd do niezależnych depozytariuszy wskazuje na proces konsolidacji. Zmienność kursu uległa zmniejszeniu, co ułatwia planowanie inwestycji w dłuższym horyzoncie. Obecne cykle rynkowe nie przypominają już gwałtownych skoków i spadków. Sprawdź, jak kupić Bitcoina. Źródło: CoinMarketCap Zamiast tego charakteryzują się spokojniejszymi, bardziej stabilnymi wzrostami. Rezerwa Strategiczna działa nie tylko jako narzędzie ochrony wartości. Stanowi również dowód na to, że państwa zaczynają włączać kryptowaluty do swoich modeli zarządzania finansami. Dla inwestorów oznacza to zwiększoną pewność, a także nowe formy zaangażowania kapitału instytucjonalnego. Zjawisko to może wpłynąć na dalsze umacnianie pozycji Bitcoina w globalnym systemie finansowym. Bitcoin Hyper – nowa warstwa funkcjonalności Pomimo coraz większej akceptacji ze strony instytucji, główna sieć Bitcoina długo pozostawała ograniczona w zakresie możliwości technologicznych. Sytuacja ta zmienia się dzięki projektowi Bitcoin Hyper. W ciągu pięciu dni sprzedaż tokena $HYPER przekroczyła milion dolarów. Sprawdź też najlepsze kryptowaluty poniżej 1 dolara. To efekt rosnącego zapotrzebowania na rozwiązania, które rozszerzają funkcjonalność Bitcoina bez naruszania jego podstawowych zasad bezpieczeństwa. Bitcoin Hyper to druga warstwa Bitcoina zbudowana na maszynie wirtualnej Solany, która działa w połączeniu z bazową warstwą BTC. Taka konstrukcja pozwala uzyskać ponad 2 tysiące transakcji na sekundę, zachowując przy tym odporność na manipulacje oraz decentralizację. Użytkownicy mogą realizować szybkie przelewy, korzystać z aplikacji zdecentralizowanych, a także uczestniczyć w nowych formach aktywności, takich jak staking czy zdecentralizowany handel. Mechanizm działania sieci Bitcoin Hyper System opiera się na transparentnym modelu. Użytkownik deponuje BTC w inteligentnym kontrakcie, który weryfikuje transakcję na podstawie danych z łańcucha bloków. Następnie sieć emituje równoważny token, możliwy do wykorzystania w ekosystemie Bitcoin Hyper($HYPER) . Po zakończeniu aktywności użytkownik może spalić token i odzyskać oryginalne BTC. W tle działają dowody zerowej wiedzy oraz weryfikacja danych przez light clients. Użytkownik przesyła bitcoiny do inteligentnego kontraktu, który potwierdza transakcję na podstawie danych z sieci głównej. Po weryfikacji powstaje równoważny token w sieci Hyper, gotowy do dalszego wykorzystania. Kiedy użytkownik chce wycofać środki, token zostaje unieważniony, a oryginalne Bitcoiny wracają do właściciela. Cały proces odbywa się z użyciem zaawansowanych metod kryptograficznych, które zapewniają bezpieczeństwo i zgodność z głównym łańcuchem bez konieczności angażowania pośredników. Właściciele tokena $HYPER mogą korzystać z produktów o podwyższonym zwrocie, zyskać dostęp do zaawansowanych narzędzi oraz uczestniczyć w dalszym rozwoju projektu. Twórcy aplikacji mają szansę uzyskać dofinansowanie i zwroty kosztów opłat sieciowych, jeśli zdecydują się wykorzystywać $HYPER w swoich kontraktach. Dane z rynku potwierdzają skuteczność modelu Bitcoin Hyper Podobne projekty już wcześniej osiągały znaczące wyniki. Arbitrum zgromadziło ponad 13 miliardów dolarów wartości zablokowanej oraz ponad milion aktywnych portfeli. Sieć Base, powiązana z Coinbase, przekroczyła wartość 2,5 miliarda dolarów i notuje ponad milion aktywnych adresów dziennie.

2025-06-11T17:20:35,"Bitcoin is key to fighting inflation, says billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones","Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones believes the best defense against inflation is a portfolio composed of Bitcoin, gold, and equities. In an interview with Bloomberg, the founder of Tudor Investment Corp. described this mix, adjusted for volatility, as the ideal hedge in what he sees as a persistently inflationary era. Jones said policymakers will likely continue to run “hot” economies by keeping real interest rates below inflation to manage mounting debt.

He also warned that such policies only work “until the population throws you out,” referencing similar dynamics in Japan. In that environment, Jones explained, assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold become critical as stores of value. While he previously advocated for a 1–2% Bitcoin allocation, Jones now emphasizes the broader case for owning the digital asset, though he declined to cite a specific percentage. Given Bitcoin’s higher volatility compared to gold, Jones recommended adjusting allocations accordingly. “That’s probably your best portfolio to fight inflation,” he said. Jones also speculated that, if re-elected, President Trump would appoint an “uber-dovish” Federal Reserve chair after Jerome Powell’s term ends, potentially accelerating these inflationary dynamics.

2025-06-11T17:20:20,"BitFuFu: Q1 Was A Strategic Reset, But Hashrate Rebound Signals A Stronger Q2 Ahead","Summary BitFuFu faced a sharp Q1 revenue and capacity decline, but operational recovery and hashrate expansion post-Q1 signal a positive turnaround. Cloud mining remains BitFuFu’s dominant revenue source, with registered users nearly doubling YoY to over 607,000 users, signaling growing retail demand despite infrastructure lag. BitFuFu's close ties with BITMAIN offer hardware procurement advantages but pose related-party and concentration risks, though liquidity remains healthy for now. Despite recent setbacks, BitFuFu’s infrastructure recovery, improving efficiency, and growth in cloud user base, point to a stronger Q2 and support my continued Buy rating for FUFU shares. BitFuFu (NASDAQ: FUFU ) is one of the new entrant publicly traded Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining companies in the current crypto market cycle. BitFuFu has grown in popularity since going public in March last year thanks to the company’s cloud mining segment, which makes Bitcoin mining more accessible to a larger audience. The company is headquartered in Singapore and has close ties with Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing giant BITMAIN. The founder and CEO of the company, Leo Lu, commands extensive experience in the crypto mining business, having headed the cloud mining division at BITMAIN for several years before going on to found BitFuFu in December 2020. Several other key members of BitFuFu’s team were former members of BITMAIN and Bitdeer ( BTDR ). BitFuFu’s long-standing relationship with BITMAIN gives an edge in securing cutting-edge mining hardware, but it also poses potential related party risks (which I’ll discuss down the line in this article). BitFuFu's operational and financial performance last year was impressive. FY24 was both an operational breakout year and an inflection point for BitFuFu, with revenue surging by 63.1% compared to FY23 and net income skyrocketing 414.3% compared to FY23. Revenue for the full-year FY24 was $463.3 million and net income was $54 million. I covered the FY24 earnings review in a previous article published here on Seeking Alpha in March this year. Reference to FY24 is necessary for an insight into the Q1 FY25 earnings and the outlook for the remaining quarters of FY25. BitFuFu Q1 FY25 results were announced last week. It was a mix of positives and negatives, with headwinds impacting top-line performance, yet underlying operational trends suggest that the company might be undergoing strategic adaptation and still showing ongoing resilience despite the headwinds faced. Virtually every miner that has reported earnings so far in 2025 has experienced headwinds that are cutting across the board. A first peek at BitFuFu’s Q1 results might suggest that FY25 is shaping up so far to be quite not like FY24. Since tariffs and macroeconomic shifts, the crypto market has been grappling with volatility. But putting volatility and Bitcoin price aside, let’s examine BitFuFu’s Q1 operational performance so far this year in this piece. FUFU has been on a nosedive since the start of the year. And on the heels of the Q1 results, the pressing question for investors is whether FUFU still presents a compelling investment opportunity in Bitcoin mining. Data by YCharts What BitFuFu FY25 Is Shaping Up To Be BitFuFu’s Q1 results must have been an unwelcome surprise for most investors following last year's stellar financial performance. The YoY decline was pronounced across the board. BitFuFu saw revenue decline in Q1 by 46% YoY. Revenue fell from $144.4 million in the same period last year to $78 million in Q1. Net loss was $16.9 million, compared to net income of $35.3 million in Q1 FY24. A breakdown of revenue shows cloud mining still holds a dominant position in the company’s operations at 68.8% of total revenue in Q1. Self-mining accounted for 22.5%, while the sale of mining equipment and other segments contributed about 8.7% of total revenue. Growth on the cloud mining side shows nearly a 100% increase in the past year, with the number of registered users growing from ~321,000 users in Q1 last year to over 607,000 users in Q1 this year. The growth in registered cloud mining users did not offset the revenue decline, though. BitFuFu attributed the decrease in financial performance to several factors, including last year's April Bitcoin halving event, an increase in blockchain network difficulty (as a result of the halving), and the temporary decrease in the company's hashrate under management in Q1. I think some of the justifications from management for the decrease in financial numbers are somewhat debatable. The halving event was over a year ago, and miners have ramped up capacity to compensate for the reduced block rewards. Moreover, the Bitcoin price has increased nearly 70% since the halving. The ~70% increase in the value of each Bitcoin mined is more than substantial enough to greatly offset, if not entirely negate, the impact of halved block rewards. I, therefore, believe that still blaming the halving in Q1 2025 is much about an attempt at deflection. I’d focus on operational factors as the main cause of BitFuFu's production and financial decline in Q1. I believe the decline in BitFuFu’s mining capacity (hashrate) and electricity capacity in Q1 (as reported by the company) were the main driving factors responsible for the decline in Bitcoin production and revenue in Q1. Operational metrics (BitFuFu form 6-K) While BitFuFu nearly doubled its cloud mining users compared to Q1 last year, the growth came at a time when total hashrate and power capacity declined sharply. This result is a telling disconnect between demand and supply. Without the infrastructure to match rising demand, revenue per user likely fell, which explains why cloud mining’s dominant share of revenue (68.8%) wasn’t enough to prevent the steep top-line decline. BitFuFu’s power capacity declined from 644 MW to 478 MW YoY, which was a 26% decline. Hashrate under management declined by 28% from 28.6 EH/s in Q1 FY24 to 20.6 EH/s in Q1 this year. Sequentially, their hashrate under management also decreased by 12.3% from 23.5 EH/s in Q4 FY4 to 20.6 EH/s in Q1 FY25, while power capacity declined sequentially by 13.3% from Q4 FY24 to Q1 FY25. I’ve pointed out the sequential capacity contraction to show that BitFuFu’s operational capacity contraction is more than just a seasonal or cyclical variation but rather reflects an ongoing operational slowdown. Moving beyond Q1, there has been some turnaround in the capacity drop at BitFuFu which was caused by expired hashrate procurement contracts, and disruptions from supplier miner fleet relocations and upgrades in Q1. BitFuFu has reported a strong recovery in capacity post-Q1, with hashrate rebounding to 28.3 EH/s as of April 30 , driven by expanded supplier partnerships and increased hash power procurement; power capacity also increased to 566 MW in April. Hashrate further increased by 20.5% to 34.1 EH/s as of May 31, while power capacity increased another 15% sequentially from April’s 566 MW to 651 MW as of May 31. Notably, much of the hashrate added is from the latest generation Antminer S21 miners deployed in May, translating to more efficiency in improving cost structure per BTC produced and maintaining competitiveness against rising mining difficulty. BitFuFu recorded an average fleet efficiency of 19.1 J/Th in May. A breakdown of BitFuFu’s hashrate composition in May tells more about BitFuFu’s asset-light ongoing business model and why reduced capacity in some quarters might be a necessary adjustment as cloud demand outstrips supply and vice versa. Of the 34.1 EH/s hashrate under management in May, 29.9 EH/s of the hashrate were from third-party hosts, while 4.2 EH/s were from its own facilities. It’s worth mentioning that the hashrate from third-party can be used flexibly by BitFuFu for both self-mining and cloud-mining services as overall demand dictates. BitFuFu’s liquidity doesn’t present an immediate concern, considering the drop in capacity and sales already discussed so far. Besides, the company has invested heavily in acquisition and expansion in the past year. BitFuFu’s BTC in treasury increased by 71.2% to 1,835 BTC as of Q1, compared to 1,072 BTC as of Q1 last year. As of May 31 (which is the latest update), BitFuFu held 1,709 BTC, a decrease of 199 BTC from figures reported in the April operations update . I think it is notable to have maintained a substantial increase in BTC held in treasury YoY despite needing to fund operational needs, strategic investments, and working capital requirements, especially during net loss quarters. BitFuFu has had two net loss quarters since Q1 last year — one in Q3 FY24, and the other is the latest in Q1 FY25. Balance sheet [$ ’000] (BitFuFu form 6-K) The balance sheet further paints a picture of a company that is actively expanding and navigating the headwinds that come with the Bitcoin mining business. On the balance sheet, we see notable growth in equipment, showing ongoing infrastructure build-out in Q1 despite the near-term capacity contraction, which further suggests that new hashrate and energy deployments were possibly delayed to later quarters or pending external infrastructure readiness. One line item that raises my eyebrow in the Q1 balance sheet is the sequential high surge in the amount due to related parties, which increased 880% from $1.6 million in Q4 last year to $15.5 million in Q1 this year. Remember, in the brief overview in the intro of this piece, I mentioned BitFuFu’s close ties with mining hardware giant BITMAIN. Some aspects of these ties are financial in nature, and BitFuFu also maintains some operational and service-related dependencies on BITMAIN, and this poses some potential concentration risks, particularly in times of liquidity strain. In BitFuFu’s latest form 20-F filing , BITMAIN is named as “a related party to a shareholder of the Company,” confirming the indirect but material connection, and translates to financial leverage or obligations likely not easily controllable by BitFuFu. We also rely on Bitmain to provide the miner hosting services under certain hosting service cooperation arrangements, through which Bitmain sources a limited number of hosting facilities to host miners and provide services related to maintenance and technical support, electricity, network, and security. These hosting facilities may demand upward adjustments of their service fees, including electricity costs, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. We cannot assure you that it can continue to maintain cooperation with these hosting facilities, or the services provided by these parties always meet the level of quality, efficiency, and timeliness necessary for us to render satisfactory hosting services to our customers. Such hosting facilities may experience interruption or other incidents from time to time and may be unable to provide services to us. We may not be able to obtain alternative hosting facility supplies in a timely manner and/or at commercially viable terms. If we are unable to effectively address these risks, our ability to serve customers will be affected, and our brand image, reputation, and financial performance may be materially and adversely affected. - Excerpt from BitFuFu Form 20-F Related parties transactions [$ ’000] (BitFuFu form 20-F) I’m highlighting these close ties because it is one of the main risks I associate with BitFuFu apart from the broader industry risks associated with Bitcoin mining in general — the risk of constrained negotiations in a business line where favorable terms and flexibility are very crucial. As of Q1, debt to related parties hasn’t posed an immediate risk, as BitFuFu still has enough liquidity to manage obligations. The quick ratio and current ratio in Q1 were 2.3 and 3.03 respectively. BitFuFu is one of the miners that least taps into equity fundraising. Investors have enjoyed a largely undiluted share structure since FUFU went public. Yesterday, BitFuFu announced a new funding plan to raise $150 million through an ATM offering. Investors should watch out for dilution in the near term. How BitFuFu Stack Up to Peers Price-to-Hodl peer comparison (Author) When comparing miners based on how much investors are paying for each dollar of Bitcoin held in treasury, BitFuFu sits in mid-tier at 3.09x Price/HODL. This makes sense as BitFuFu does not pursue a full HODL strategy but liquidates some produced BTC to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives. I believe BitFuFu’s P/HODL is more likely to shrink in the near-to-mid term, and FUFU becoming more attractive if the miner continues to emphasize operational growth, as we've seen with hashrate and power capacity turnaround and the acquisition of the 51 MW data center facility in Oklahoma in Q1 among other growth initiatives. Also, BitFuFu’s balance sheet isn’t so strained that it will need so much ongoing divesting of BTC produced in self-mining. Data by YCharts BitFuFu’s P/S (TTM) at 1.51x remains attractive among mining peers despite the drop in revenue in Q1. Last year’s strength in sales still supports the P/S ratio on a TTM basis. As we have analyzed the factors that influenced the drop in revenue in Q1, BitFuFu’s latest reported 34.1 EH/s (which already surpasses the hashrate guidance for the full year 2025 of 33 EH/s) and recovery of power capacity signals an upside setup for Q2 and a potentially lower P/S when Q2 results are announced, prompting a rerating of the metric if Bitcoin also maintains its current momentum. Despite the headwinds, I’m reiterating a Buy for FUFU here on the operational recovery post-Q1 and the ongoing growth prospects the operational recovery presents.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794137-bitfufu-q1-was-a-strategic-reset-but-hashrate-rebound-signals-a-stronger-q2-ahead?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","BTC-USD|BTDR|FUFUW|FUFU",cryptocompare

This trust-minimized protocol transforms Bitcoin into functional DeFi capital while preserving full user custody. tBTC is now available for direct minting on Starknet via the Threshold UI, allowing users to seamlessly bring native BTC onchain without custodians or intermediaries. With Bitcoin’s average transaction fee at $1.49 ( 7-day moving average, June 2025 ), it’s no match for Starknet’s ultra-low costs, where the same Bitcoin, via tBTC, can be traded, lent, or deployed in complex DeFi strategies for just $0.01 per transaction. “BTC on Bitcoin Mainnet is like gold bars in a vault: valuable but unusable,” said MacLane Wilkison, Co-Founder of Threshold Labs. “At just $0.01 per transaction on Starknet, Bitcoin becomes more than a store of value — it can now be used for small to large-scale trades, executed hundreds of times a day, and as a source of capital to lend or even borrow against. This is Bitcoin as it was meant to be used.” The Numbers: Why Bitcoin DeFi Struggles Current Bitcoin mainnet reality (June 2025 data): Average transaction fee: $1.49 (7-day moving average) Recent peak during congestion: $91.89 (April 2024) Confirmation time: 10-60 minutes Result : Complex DeFi operations become uneconomical: even at $1.49, a $100 trade costs 1.5% in fees. tBTC on Starknet changes the economics: Transaction fees: $0.01 Confirmation: Instant Throughput: 857 TPS (achieved in testing) Result: Bitcoin becomes a working capital, operating at minimal cost. What’s Coming Next for tBTC x Starknet With the launch of tBTC on Starknet, Threshold Network is building the foundation for a Bitcoin-Ethereum economy within a scalable, zero-knowledge environment. tBTC is integrating with Starknet’s most prominent protocols to bring trust-minimized Bitcoin liquidity to trading, borrowing, and beyond. Live on Launch: DEX Trading on Ekubo – Native Starknet DEXs enable deep, efficient trading of tBTC against select pairs. Users can deploy capital with minimal slippage and explore high-frequency strategies at a much lower cost.

2025-06-11T16:37:05,"Bitcoin tests resistance near ATH as analysts eye $120K, KAIA leads altcoins","Bitcoin bulls attempted to break past all time highs today as momentum returned across the market amid bullish developments on the macro front. Crypto bulls found fresh footing as the market’s total capitalisation soared past $2.6 trillion, snapping back to highs last seen in late May. Meanwhile, the Fear & Greed Index spiked seven points to 64, capturing a decisive turn in sentiment towards ‘greed’ levels. With global risk appetite on the rise, traders appear to be chasing momentum across majors and altcoins alike. Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin’s latest surge comes on the heels of growing optimism that the U.S. and China are nearing the end of their long-standing trade standoff, a geopolitical development that has historically influenced broader market sentiment. A statement from U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social confirmed that a trade agreement is “done,” pending final approval with Chinese President Xi Jinping. One of the key pressure points, rare earth exports, now appears less volatile, with both sides signalling a de-escalation. Although equity futures responded cautiously, digital assets reacted more decisively. For crypto markets, the prospect of reduced geopolitical friction translates to diminished systemic risk, opening the door for renewed capital inflows. Easing trade hostilities sets the stage for a more supportive macro environment. That’s particularly bullish for Bitcoin, which remains highly sensitive to shifts in liquidity and investor risk appetite. As a hybrid asset that straddles the line between speculative growth and macro hedge, Bitcoin has responded sharply to this potential turning point in global policy dynamics. The prospect of a U.S.–China trade resolution is prompting investors to rotate capital back into risk assets, with many expecting dormant institutional flows to re-enter the market. With fears of escalation receding, Bitcoin is regaining its appeal as a high-conviction bet on reflation, policy flexibility, and long-term digital asset adoption. The momentum was further reinforced by remarks from China’s Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang, who confirmed that the two countries had reached an “in-principle agreement” and engaged in “candid and in-depth” talks during negotiations in London. This adds credibility to Trump’s remarks and signals a coordinated effort toward finalizing the deal. For crypto markets, the timing is critical. The rally aligns with broader risk-on signals in global markets, rising open interest in Bitcoin futures, and strengthening fundamentals. With macro headwinds softening and sentiment improving rapidly, Bitcoin may be entering a new phase of price discovery. Will Bitcoin rise again? Market analysts appear increasingly confident that Bitcoin is on the verge of reclaiming its all-time high, with several pointing to a technical setup that suggests price acceleration is near. At the time of writing, BTC was trading just less than 2% below its all-time high of over $111,000, testing key resistance amid growing bullish momentum. Popular analyst Jelle noted that Bitcoin’s monthly chart “looks ready for acceleration,” suggesting the market may be gearing up for a sustained breakout. He expects an immediate rally towards $120,000 if the $108,000 level flips into support, with the possibility of a cycle top forming around $140,000 to $150,000. A similar sentiment was echoed by MN Capital’s Michael van de Poppe, who argued that the recent break above $106,500 triggered the current rally. He believes that another push above $110,500 could set the stage for fresh all-time highs, although some short-term consolidation may be required before that happens. “The first period of consolidation typically lasts a few days. Then, we’re going to have the next breakout above the ATH,” Poppe said in a recent X post. On-chain data further supports the bullish thesis.

A breakout here could spark what traders refer to as a liquidation squeeze, rapidly forcing short sellers to exit and propelling the price toward the next liquidity cluster at $114,000.

Some pointed to a recent breakout above a descending wedge structure on the daily chart, a pattern often associated with confirmation of bullish reversals. BTC/USDT 1-day price chart. Source: CryptoJack . Altcoins see renewed momentum With macro headwinds easing and risk appetite on the rise, altcoins are beginning to gain traction which some analysts are viewing as the early signal of an incoming altcoin season. Historically, new Bitcoin all-time highs are often followed by capital flowing into altcoins, and several metrics now point to a similar rotation underway. Bitcoin dominance remains elevated at 64–65%, yet the Altcoin Season Index has quietly climbed into the low 30s, a subtle but telling sign that investors are beginning to broaden their exposure. With risk sentiment improving, traders appear more willing to rotate into altcoins in search of higher upside. Pseudonymous analyst Moustache pointed to an ascending broadening wedge forming on altcoin dominance charts, now approaching a key breakdown level. He noted that a similar structure preceded a strong altcoin rally in November. Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap rose nearly 3% to $1.4 trillion at the time of writing. Ethereum, the leading altcoin by market cap, rose 3.5% over the day, trading at $2,840, its highest level seen since February 24, while other large-cap altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) recorded gains ranging between 1-5% while Tron (TRX) being an exception dipping 1% over the period. Kaia (KAIA) stood as the leading gainer of the day among the top 99 altcoins with gains of 23.3%, while SPX6900 (SPX) and Jito (JTO) followed, holding on to gains of 18.8% and 13.3% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap KAIA’s gains today came as excitement grew around its plan to launch a South Korean won–based stablecoin following its recent launch of native USDT on Kaia Chain. Some of the momentum was also fuelled by news of a potential partnership with Japanese messaging giant LINE. SPX6900 hit a new all-time high of $1.62, supported by an uptick in whale accumulation, and the broader shift in market sentiment triggered by Bitcoin’s rebound. Similarly, Jito rallied with no particular catalyst driving the move apart from broader market momentum.

2025-06-11T16:30:13,"Bitcoin Outflow Exodus: Investors Show Confidence With Massive Withdrawals From Crypto Exchanges","Following Bitcoin’s recent stunning rebound from the $105,000 threshold, the flagship asset appears to have found robust support and stability above $109,000. With bullish sentiment returning to the market, a report has revealed a massive wave of BTC outflows from crypto exchanges over a long period. A Significant BTC Outflow From Crypto Exchanges Amidst a strong rally by Bitcoin , Alphractal, an advanced on-chain analytics platform, has shed light on the massive BTC outflows from cryptocurrency exchanges over the past 5 years. When a coin is consistently withdrawn from crypto exchanges, it reflects a growing preference for self-custody. According to the on-chain platform, the Bitcoin balance on exchanges has shown a startling pattern since February 2020, with a total of 3.77 million BTC leaving these platforms. These significant BTC outflows during this period are valued at a whopping $219 billion, which is higher than the amount of coins these exchanges are managing to accumulate. Despite how the development may appear, the platform highlighted that this is an indication of selling by investors. “In short, the $219 billion BTC exodus from exchanges doesn’t reflect fear,” Alphractal stated. Rather, it portrays the robust belief of investors who view Bitcoin as the future’s digital gold. It is worth noting that Alphractal considers this trend as one of the strongest indicators of market confidence and maturity. After delving into the Exchange Flux Balance, a key metric that provides clarity on investors’ behavior on crypto platforms, Alphratcal outlined key takeaways in the massive outflows. The first takeaway is a long-term strategy (HODL) by investors as BTC owners move their coins to private wallets. This behavior sends a clear message that these investors view the flagship asset as a long-term store of value and have no immediate plans to sell. While the trend persists, this action demonstrates a high level of confidence in BTC’s long-term prospects . Particularly, these investors are exhibiting their long-term commitment by taking self-custody of their coins, which lowers the available supply and can lead to a supply squeeze. As BTC becomes less available on exchanges or a supply squeeze occurs, it is likely to reduce selling pressure. Historically, this is generally regarded as an exceptionally bullish indication since a tighter supply can raise prices when demand grows. BTC’s Price Makes Key Move With BTC’s on-chain dynamics flashing bullish signals alongside positive, promising chart formations, the asset may gain enough momentum for a sustained upward push. Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst, has forecasted an impending substantial rally for Bitcoin in the following months. The expert anticipates a major rally as BTC makes a perfect Mean Reversion central line along its uptrend, spanning for 2.5 years or since late 2023. As seen in the weekly chart, Bitcoin’s price has currently dropped back below this central level. Should BTC break past the central line, the expert believes it might increase its price to $230,000 before retracing to the line.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-exchange-outflow-exodus/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Exchange Flux Balance|Hodl|Mean Reversion|Trader Tardigrade",cryptocompare

While still modestly up 5% over the past week, SHIB has been bruised by a 23% monthly drop and remains 40% down from a year ago—yet today’s outperformance could signal early momentum for a rebound. Notably, the Shiba Inu protocol has just introduced several upgrades which make SHIB and its ecosystem tokens – TREAT, BONE and LEASH – more efficient and attractive to use.

Precision Liquidity Pools Are Live •LPs can… pic.twitter.com/sFaDIddPyC — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) June 9, 2025 Some of the main improvements include more efficient staking, precision liquidity pools, auto burns triggered by trading activity (e.g. swaps, liquidity actions), and a streamlining of trading interfaces. This all conspires to make the Shiba Inu ecosystem more attractive to seasoned traders, which in turn should boost demand for SHIB and its related tokens. The deployment of these upgrades is arguably part of the reason why the Shiba Inu price has done well today, outperforming the market average. And if we look at its chart, we see that it has begun regaining momentum after a period of decline that began in the middle of May. Its RSI (purple) has jumped up to 50 after plunging to 30 a week ago, while its 30-day average (orange) has bottomed out in relation to the 200-day (blue), suggesting that a big rebound is coming. Source: TradingView Given that SHIB is still 84% down on its ATH of $0.00008616 (set in October 2021), there’s arguably lots of room for the token to continue rising without entering a dangerously overbought region. And if the market continues its gradual improvement of the past few weeks, we could see the Shiba Inu price reach $0.000020 at some point next month. In combination with recent upgrades, upcoming launches, such as that of ShibOS, could also help it reach $0.000050 by Q4. The Next Breakout Token? This New Presale Altcoin Could Outpace SHIB by Miles Because SHIB is waiting on upgrades to take effect and boost wider adoption, it may not experience big gains for several months yet. In that case, investors may prefer to turn to newer tokens with more short-term potential, including presale coins that could rally when they list for the first time. One of the newest and most interesting presale tokens in the market right now is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an Ethereum-based project that will be launching a layer-two network for Bitcoin. The $HYPER Pre-Sale is now LIVE! Get up to speed https://t.co/yzXqAckjDw pic.twitter.com/sij7UFBOcb — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) May 8, 2025 It launched its presale last month, and has already raised in excess of $1 million, pointing to considerable early interest in the token and its platform. Its L2 network will provide Bitcoin users with faster transactions and lower fees, with the platform promising near-instant finality. Initially running on Ethereum, it will also expand to Solana after its launch, taking advantage of the latter’s high scalability. And this will enable Bitcoin Hyper to offer a range of DeFi apps and protocols, enabling BTC holders to put their funds into more volatile meme tokens. This all makes Bitcoin Hyper one of the more interesting new project to watch, with investors able to join its sale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . HYPER is currently available at $0.01185, although this will rise periodically for as long as the sale lasts.

2025-06-11T16:20:50,"Shocking Bitcoin Core Update Sparks OCEAN VP’s Exit From Crypto","BitcoinWorld Shocking Bitcoin Core Update Sparks OCEAN VP’s Exit From Crypto Major news from the world of Bitcoin mining is making waves. Jason Hughes, the vice president of the OCEAN mining pool , a prominent figure in the space, has announced a drastic decision: he is selling all his Bitcoin (BTC) and stepping away from the crypto industry entirely. This isn’t a sudden whim; his departure is directly linked to his strong opposition to an upcoming Bitcoin Core update . OCEAN VP Makes Shocking Exit Over Bitcoin Core Update The news, initially reported by Protos, details Jason Hughes’ significant move. As VP of OCEAN, a mining pool known for its commitment to transparent and non-custodial practices, Hughes’ voice carries weight within the community. His decision to liquidate his entire BTC stack and leave crypto permanently underscores the depth of his concerns regarding the direction of Bitcoin development. Hughes publicly expressed his profound disappointment, specifically calling out 31 developers involved in the project. This indicates a significant ideological rift concerning the future path of Bitcoin Core, the software that underpins the entire Bitcoin network . Understanding the Controversial Bitcoin Core Update v30 At the heart of this controversy is Version 30 of Bitcoin Core, an update slated for release in October. The key change causing friction involves how non-financial data is handled within Bitcoin transactions. Currently, there’s a widely recognized limit of 80 bytes for data included in the OP_RETURN field, which is typically used for embedding small pieces of information on the blockchain. The proposed change in v30 would significantly raise the default allowance for this non-financial data, potentially up to nearly 4MB. While node operators would retain the ability to configure this setting, the increased default is designed to facilitate broader functionality and potentially new use cases on the Bitcoin network . Think things like embedding larger amounts of arbitrary data or enabling more complex transaction types. Key Aspects of the v30 Update: Increased Data Limit: Default allowance for non-financial data jumps from 80 bytes (OP_RETURN) to potentially near 4MB. Purpose: Aims to enable broader functionality and new use cases on the network. Configurability: Node operators can still adjust the setting away from the default. Release Timeline: Currently scheduled for October. Why is the Bitcoin Network Facing Pushback? The proposed increase in the data limit isn’t universally welcomed. Critics, including Jason Hughes and other prominent figures like developers Luke Dashjr and BitcoinMechanic, argue that this change moves Bitcoin away from its original purpose primarily as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Their concerns center on several potential negative impacts: Network Strain: Allowing larger data payloads in transactions could lead to significantly larger block sizes, placing increased strain on the Bitcoin network . This means nodes would need more storage, bandwidth, and processing power to download, validate, and store the blockchain. This could potentially make it harder and more expensive for individuals to run full nodes, leading to increased centralization. Deviation from Purpose: Opponents argue that using the blockchain to store large amounts of non-financial or arbitrary data clutters the ledger and deviates from Bitcoin’s core function as a monetary network. They see this as a misuse of block space, which is a scarce and valuable resource. Impact on Fees: Increased demand for block space due to larger data could potentially drive up transaction fees, making simple Bitcoin transactions more expensive. The Perspective from Bitcoin Mining As VP of an OCEAN mining pool , Jason Hughes’ perspective is particularly relevant. Mining pools are at the forefront of processing transactions and creating new blocks. Miners are directly impacted by changes that affect block size, transaction volume, and network strain. While the update aims to enable new functionalities that might bring new types of transactions (and thus fees), the potential for increased network strain and deviation from core principles is a significant concern for those invested in the long-term health and decentralization of the Bitcoin network . Hughes’ decision highlights that this isn’t just a technical debate among developers; it has real-world consequences for individuals and businesses operating within the ecosystem, prompting even key players like an OCEAN VP to consider their future involvement. Voices of Dissent: The Stance of Luke Dashjr and Others Jason Hughes is not alone in his opposition. Developer Luke Dashjr has been a vocal critic of practices that utilize block space for non-financial data, often referring to them as ‘inscriptions’ or ‘spam’. His stance is rooted in a strict interpretation of Bitcoin’s design, emphasizing its role purely as a monetary system. BitcoinMechanic is another developer aligned with this view, raising concerns about the technical implications and the philosophical direction the project is taking. The fact that Hughes aligns himself with these particular developers underscores that his concerns are deeply technical and ideological, revolving around the fundamental principles he believes the Bitcoin network should uphold. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Community? An executive from a major Bitcoin mining pool exiting the space over a core protocol change is a significant event. It highlights the ongoing, sometimes intense, debates within the Bitcoin community about scalability, block space usage, and the project’s long-term vision. While some developers and users see the v30 update as a way to innovate and expand Bitcoin’s capabilities, others view it as a threat to its core properties of decentralization and its primary function as digital cash. This situation serves as a powerful example of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin development and governance – there’s no single authority dictating changes, leading to robust, sometimes contentious, discussions among developers, users, miners, and businesses. For the average Bitcoin holder or enthusiast, it’s a reminder of the technical complexities and the differing philosophies that shape the network’s evolution. In Conclusion: The departure of OCEAN VP Jason Hughes is a striking development stemming from the controversy surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin Core update v30. His decision, echoed by critics like Luke Dashjr , highlights deep concerns about potential network strain and whether the change aligns with the fundamental purpose of the Bitcoin network . This event underscores the vital, ongoing debate within the community about the future direction and technical evolution of Bitcoin, reminding everyone that even seemingly technical updates can have significant ideological and personal consequences.

During public remarks on June 6, he said he would name Powell’s replacement “very soon,” offering a rare public signal about a leadership transition still more than a year away. That comment also marked a shift in tone from earlier this year, when Trump repeatedly criticized Powell for keeping interest rates high. He has argued that elevated rates are harming economic growth and interfering with the administration’s broader goals. Tensions between Trump and Powell date back to Trump’s first term. Although Trump appointed Powell as Fed Chair in 2017, he soon became frustrated with Powell’s monetary policy stance, particularly the rate hikes in 2018 and 2019. The conflict resurfaced during Trump’s second term. Powell’s refusal to lower rates in the face of inflation concerns and Trump’s tariff policies was viewed by some in the administration as obstructive. On Apr. 4, Trump renewed his criticism on Truth Social, writing that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough.” Federal law prevents the president from removing a sitting Fed chair without cause, a point reinforced by a Supreme Court ruling in May 2025 that upheld the Fed’s institutional independence. The decision effectively blocked any attempt to replace Powell before his term expires. Bessent, for his part, advised against such an effort. In an interview with Politico on April 17, he warned that removing Powell early could trigger financial instability and undermine global confidence in U.S. economic governance. How is the Fed Chair appointed? The Fed Chair is nominated by the President of the U.S. and must be confirmed by the Senate. The position carries a four-year term, although reappointments are common, and chairs often serve across multiple administrations. While the Fedis structured to function independently of political pressure, the nomination process remains political in nature, especially during periods of economic volatility or leadership transition. Powell’s current term ends in May 2026, giving the Trump administration more than a year to evaluate potential successors. Even so, early signals about the direction of the nomination can influence market behavior well in advance of any formal decision. Analysts and global financial institutions track these developments closely. Shifts in leadership at the Fed often coincide with changes in monetary policy, interest rate strategy, and financial regulation. The role of the Chair extends beyond setting interest rates. It also includes managing inflation expectations, ensuring financial system stability, and communicating policy direction to domestic and international audiences. For investors, clarity around the next nominee, and the policy philosophy they are likely to bring, can influence confidence levels and capital allocation decisions across both traditional and crypto markets. Scott Bessent Fed Chair talk gains momentum, but rivals like Kevin Warsh loom Bessent’s financial background, including time spent as Soros Fund Management’s chief investment officer, has added to his credibility among Republican economic advisors. Still, Bessent is not the only name being discussed. Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and one of the candidates interviewed for the Treasury Secretary post in late 2024, is considered a strong contender due to his central banking experience. Economist Arthur Laffer has publicly endorsed Warsh, stating, “I think Kevin Warsh is just perfect for the job,” while acknowledging that Bessent’s strengths lie in areas other than monetary policy. Other figures floated include Kevin Hassett, who leads the White House’s National Economic Council, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, and former World Bank President David Malpass. Each brings a different profile, but all are viewed as potentially more aligned with Trump’s economic approach. What makes the situation notable is not just who the next Fed chair might be, but how early the discussion has begun. While Bessent has not publicly confirmed interest in the role, his proximity to decision-makers and his growing influence on Trump’s economic agenda are enough to keep the conversation going. Decoding the Scott Bessent crypto calculus If Bessent is eventually nominated to lead the Fed, the implications would likely go well beyond interest rate decisions. His record as Treasury Secretary already offers early signals about how he might approach monetary leadership. Since taking office in early 2025, Bessent has been a key figure in executing the economic side of President Trump’s policy agenda. He has worked to sustain financial market confidence while backing a mix of tax reductions and tariffs aimed at restructuring global trade relationships. He has also been directly involved in U.S.-China trade negotiations , a process that continues to influence volatility and risk sentiment. Both factors tend to spill over into crypto markets, where shifts in geopolitical or currency outlooks often affect demand for decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Bessent’s name has also been linked to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal, a Trump-era initiative exploring the idea of holding Bitcoin at a national level. While he has not taken a formal position on crypto regulation, several reports have described him as “pro-Bitcoin,” citing his openness to including digital assets within broader economic strategy. In a comment on Jun. 11, Bessent said, “I have the best job in Washington. The president will decide who’s best for the economy and the American people.” Although he did not confirm interest in the Fed Chair position, the remark reinforced the perception that he remains central to Trump’s economic team. If he were to assume leadership of the Fed, markets might expect a tilt toward a more flexible policy approach aligned with Trump’s preference for lower rates and looser financial conditions. During his time at Treasury, Bessent supported fiscal measures focused on growth, many of which benefit from accommodative monetary policy. If those views carry over into a central banking role, traders could interpret it as a signal for future rate cuts, particularly if inflation data continues to ease. Such a stance would likely benefit equities and risk assets, including crypto assets, which tend to perform better in environments where liquidity is high and interest rates are low. Even so, Bessent’s crypto positioning appears tactical rather than ideological. His support for digital assets seems rooted in advancing Trump’s broader economic strategy, rather than stemming from a strong personal belief in blockchain technology. For crypto markets, the more relevant factor may not be direct regulation but the macroeconomic backdrop Bessent would help shape, including interest rate policy, inflation expectations, and fiscal signals that continue to guide capital flows into or out of digital assets. Experts see both stability and risk in a potential Jerome Powell resignation Bessent’s potential nomination has drawn a broad spectrum of reactions from policymakers and market observers. Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance, pointed to Bessent’s standing in the global financial community as a reason to take his candidacy seriously. “Given the amount of trust and confidence that the global financial community has in Scott Bessent, he’s an obvious candidate,” Adams said, while also describing him as “a dark horse candidate,” noting that formal momentum remains uncertain. Steve Bannon, former White House strategist and close adviser to President Trump, spoke more emphatically. He praised Bessent’s policy leadership during a volatile start to 2025 and described him as both loyal to Trump’s agenda and dependable in the eyes of markets. “He’s not just the star of the cabinet, but a safe pair of hands for global capital markets,” Bannon said. Others have raised practical and institutional concerns. Economist Laffer acknowledged Bessent’s strengths but questioned the fit. “He is wonderful, but he already has a job. And his specialty is not monetary policy,” Laffer said. Criticism has also come from lawmakers focused on preserving the Fed’s independence. Senator Elizabeth Warren, speaking on the Senate floor in November 2024, warned that political interference in the central bank could erode investor confidence. “It would be a serious error for the Trump administration to interfere with the Fed’s independence,” she said, adding that placing a loyalist in the role might provoke instability rather than calm. Market veteran Ed Yardeni expressed similar concerns. In an interview with Barron’s, he cited Bessent’s past references to a “shadow Fed chair” model as troubling. Yardeni argued that even the perception of dual leadership could unsettle markets, stating it would “create a lot of noise in the market” and risk amplifying investor anxiety. Market behavior has historically responded quickly to signals around Fed leadership. Following President Trump’s criticism of Powell in April 2025, U.S. equities registered a 2% single-day decline, reflecting how even political rhetoric around the Fed can affect investor sentiment. Crypto markets, which tend to exhibit higher volatility, may react even more sharply to ambiguity or sudden shifts in central bank leadership. Without clarity, short-term swings could intensify. Whether Bessent ultimately calms or unsettles markets may depend less on the nomination itself and more on how investors interpret the balance between his alignment with the White House and his respect for institutional boundaries.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/scott-bessent-next-fed-chair-crypto-impact/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Feature|Federal Reserve|Jerome Powell|Regulation|United States",cryptocompare
