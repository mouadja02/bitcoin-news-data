2025-06-01T15:39:51,"JD Vance Sparks Bitcoin Buzz After $2T Rally – BTC Bull Token Could 10x Next","It’s official: Bitcoin isn’t just for tech bros anymore. With the U.S. Senator JD Vance now publicly backing Bitcoin’s rise – hot on the heels of a jaw-dropping $2T market cap rally – the political tide is turning. Vance isn’t some fringe player. He’s a rising star in Washington with a growing following, and when he speaks, markets listen. His latest take? Bitcoin is no longer an outsider bet – it’s the future of money. And when politicians start going long on crypto, you know the mainstream floodgates are about to burst wide open. But while Bitcoin itself is having a moment, there’s another token quietly climbing the charts – and it’s built for those who want to ride this political and financial wave with more firepower. Meet BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – the most hyped new crypto project in the current crypto presale market, and one that many believe has 10x potential in the coming year. Why Vance’s Bitcoin Praise Matters JD Vance’s endorsement of Bitcoin isn’t just a blip in the news cycle. It signals a major cultural and political shift. On May 28, 2025, during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, U.S. Vice President JD Vance predicted that the number of Americans owning Bitcoin could double to 100M. He emphasized that Bitcoin is no longer an outsider bet but the future of money, highlighting its recent surge to a $2T market cap as evidence of its thriving status. For years, Bitcoin has been seen as a threat to the status quo – a rebel asset with too much attitude. But as the dollar weakens and inflation whispers turn into screams, politicians like Vance are rebranding Bitcoin from ‘dangerous’ to ‘inevitable.’ He pointed to Bitcoin’s $2T surge as a sign that it’s not just surviving – it’s thriving. That kind of statement, coming from Capitol Hill, is like the Bat-Signal for both retail investors and serious money. It also feeds into a growing anti-establishment, pro-Bitcoin narrative. And when the people in power start cheering for the decentralized alternative… that’s your cue. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – New Crypto Project Riding The Bitcoin Wave Bitcoin is exploding – and so is the demand for crypto projects that can turn that growth into real returns. That’s where BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) comes charging in. $BTCBULL is a meme-powered, community-driven token that’s laser-focused on one mission: helping everyday investors ride Bitcoin’s historic surge to $1M. What makes $BTCBULL different? It’s the first meme coin that rewards you with real Bitcoin. That’s right – HODL $BTCBULL, earn $BTC. Every time Bitcoin hits a major price milestone – $150K, or $200K – $BTCBULL holders get airdropped actual Bitcoin. As Bitcoin crosses key thresholds, $BTCBULL tokens are permanently burned, reducing supply and increasing scarcity – a classic crypto power move. There’s a catch (and a good one): airdrops only go to those who both buy and hold via Best Wallet . This exclusivity keeps the rewards system tight and targeted – and it gives those who opt in a huge advantage. There are very few Bitcoin-themed meme coins right now, despite $BTC being the most dominant asset in crypto history. $BTCBULL is filling that gap – with a fun, bullish vibe and real rewards. As political momentum grows around $BTC, projects like BTC Bull Token stand to benefit the most. Here’s What $BTCBULL Might Be Worth If You Jump in Now Right now, BTC Bull Token is priced at just $0.00254, with more than $6.6M raised in its presale. The project is gaining serious traction, thanks to its unique combo of real Bitcoin rewards, built-in token burns, and a perfect launch window amid rising pro-Bitcoin sentiment. According to price predictions , $BTCBULL could hit a forecast high of $0.0302 by the end of 2025, which would represent a massive 1,089% increase from its current price. Even if the token only reaches the low end of predictions – say, $0.0125 by 2026 – that’s still close to 400% growth. Now imagine you put in $500 today. At the current presale price, you’d receive approximately 196,850 tokens. If you staked those tokens at the current 15% APY, you’d have about 226,378 tokens after a year – that’s nearly 29,5K tokens in passive gains, just for holding. At today’s price, your portfolio would already grow to around $574 after staking. But if $BTCBULL reaches $0.0302, your tokens would be worth roughly $6,833. Even in a more cautious scenario – say it only hits $0.0125 by 2026 – you’d still be sitting on a portfolio worth around $2,829. And this doesn’t even factor in the free Bitcoin airdrops you’d earn if Bitcoin crosses key milestones like $150K or $200K – which are looking more and more possible as politicians like JD Vance step in to back BTC publicly. Turning Political Power Into Profit Potential JD Vance just handed Bitcoin a political megaphone. And in a market that thrives on narrative and momentum, that changes everything. BTC Bull Token is stepping into that spotlight – giving retail investors a way to turn big-picture optimism into real potential gains. It’s bold, fast, and a little wild. Just like crypto should be.

2025-06-01T15:04:53,"Best Altcoins to Buy Before Bitcoin Becomes ‘Exponentially Harder to Buy’","‘No force on earth can stop it’ is what Michael Saylor, Strategy’s founder, had to say about the digital gold during the recently concluded Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas. As the head of possibly the most pro-crypto corporation, Saylor pointed towards the growing interest among other large companies to replicate Strategy’s Bitcoin play. Keep reading to find out exactly what Saylor said and why his unwavering confidence in Bitcoin provides retailers like you and us the opportunity to accumulate the best altcoins before the next crypto rally. Companies Worldwide Are Embracing Bitcoin During his time at the Bitcoin event, Saylor noticed a surreal ‘explosion of interest’ by companies to follow Strategy’s ‘buy and HODL $BTC’ playbook. Moreover, the companies that approached Saylor during the event belonged to different parts of the world, including the UK, Hong Kong, and South Korea. This is huge because it confirms that $BTC’s rising popularity isn’t just limited to the US. Speaking of the US, it’s worth remembering that president Trump signed an executive order earlier this year, kickstarting the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Combined with Vice President JD Vance’s recent address to the Bitcoin community, where he said that $BTC is ‘a hedge against inflation, censorship, and unelected bureaucrats,’ it’s easy to see the merit behind Saylor’s Bitcoin stance. In addition to calling Bitcoin ‘the most explosive idea of the era’ and ‘an idea whose time has come,’ Saylor also remarked that an unprecedented interest in buying $BTC could make it exponentially harder to accumulate the asset. We think it will get exponentially harder to buy Bitcoin, but we will work exponentially more efficiently to buy Bitcoin – Michael Saylor Everything signals to this being a perfect time to buy and HODL some of the top cryptos that could pump heavily during a $BTC supply squeeze. To help you get started, here are our top three recommendations. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Altcoin on the Market Right Now BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is arguably the best crypto to buy now thanks to its never-before-seen approach to following Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. $BTCBULL holders who store their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive free (and 100% legit) $BTC as airdrops. These airdrops will take place whenever the king cryptocurrency reaches the mighty price landmarks of $150K and $200K for the very first time. Additionally, BTC Bull Token will also regularly burn a portion of its total token supply. This will keep a check on the token’s availability, hiking its demand and price during Bitcoin bull runs. Needless to say, the best time to buy a new meme coin is when it’s in presale, which, luckily for you, $BTCBULL is. The project has raised over $6.6M, and each token is currently available for just $0.00254. Here’s how to buy it . 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Altcoin for Real-Time Crypto Investment Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is the perfect ally to have during a crypto bull run. This AI agent coin will identify the best cryptos to invest in on your behalf, and that, too, after carefully analyzing social trends and on-chain activity data. $MIND interacts with crypto influencers on platforms like X, where it patiently listens to their unique opinions on various altcoins going around. Next, it combines this data with real-time information from CoinMarketCap and DexScreener to find out underrated coins that are silently shaping up to become the next cryptos to explode . It’s worth noting, though, that access to MIND of Pepe ‘s actionable crypto trading signals will be reserved for $MIND token holders. If you want to become a $MIND owner, this might just be your last chance. The project’s presale ($12M+ raised) is coming to a close in less than 36 hours, following which you’d probably never be able to buy $MIND for a low price of $0.0037515. 3. TROLL ($TROLL) – Meme Coin Based on Internet Trolling TROLL’s success is proof that there’s still enough space for ‘dank’ internet users who like to indulge in occasional – and hopefully harmless – online trolling. This low-cap coin has surged over 120% since its launch in the latter half of April. Over 8% of these gains have come in just the last seven days, making $TROLL one of the top trending cryptos currently. $TROLL is currently trading at $0.02189 , and a break above the $0.023 resistance level can see it reach for $0.028. Moreover, with continued momentum, especially during a trending crypto market, can see $TROLL even claim its all-time high of around $0.040. If this prediction holds true, investors who position themselves in $TROLL now can potentially churn out 180% in returns. DYOR Before Investing in the Best Altcoins With a squeeze in Bitcoin supply likely to send the broader crypto market soaring, top presale altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) are certainly great inclusions in your crypto portfolio. However, beware that the crypto market is highly volatile; it turns and twists upon every big and small macroeconomic event. We’d advise you to only invest after doing your own research and due diligence. None of the above is a substitute for professional financial advice.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-altcoins-to-buy-before-bitcoin-becomes-exponentially-harder-to-buy/,"ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
2025-06-01T15:04:29,"CONY: Sky-High Payouts But Near-Term Uncertainty Rising","Summary CONY's high yield is driven by a covered-call strategy on Coinbase, but the share price has declined over 60% since inception. Current market conditions—low implied volatility and unfavorable Bitcoin seasonality—make covered-call selling less attractive for CONY. I'm bullish on Bitcoin long-term due to ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and reduced exchange supply, but June seasonality tempers my enthusiasm. I rate CONY a sell, Coinbase and Bitcoin a hold, citing systematic strategy risks, low volatility, and seasonal headwinds for CONY. The YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) sells covered-call on Coinbase stock and distributes the premia proceeds to holders. This distribution currently annualizes into a 123.31% rate. However, this isn't a yield in the traditional sense where usually some kind of relatively steady profit is disbursed. Like with REITs or MLPs or leveraged fixed-income CEFs or things like that. The graph below illustrates this effect and how the share price went down over 60% since inception while the yield lead to a positive total return of ~109%: Data by YCharts A low triple digit return since inception is very good. However, I'd caution this is driven in part by the strong return of the underlying. The return profile is relatively favorable to sell covered calls. I'm also apprehensive of what's essentially a mechanical covered-call selling strategy. Selling more calls as money pours into the ETF: Data by YCharts This could potentially depress call prices, which is to the strategy's disadvantage. Last time I wrote about CONY I said: This time, I think there is a chance the underlying will be surprisingly strong in April and that makes it unfavorable to sell short-term calls against it. I’ll detail why I think Coinbase could do well during April. and I’m wary of the Coinbase seasonal data because it usually holds its earnings call in March, but the next one is coming up at the end of April. I think April could be a lot better this time around. Because generally Bitcoin is also quite strong in April, that lines up favorably. Coinbase got hammered on April 2 along with the rest of the market but recovered well. I don't remember how I got the notion earnings were moved to the end of April because they were May 8, and they propelled the stock. Coinbase and Bitcoin both ended up at ~21% with CONY lagging at a very respectable 9%. Data by YCharts Meanwhile, we're moving into June when Bitcoin seasonality is unfavorable. This is relevant because Coinbase price is quite correlated with the most important digital asset. Bitcoin Seasonality (Author's Own) Last time I argued Coinbase volatility was very low, making selling calls less attractive. It is now even lower. In the past 6 or 12-month periods the IV has only been lower 9% of the time. A silver lining; out of the money Coinbase calls are now somewhat more expensive than similar puts. Last time this wasn't the case while it is common for Coinbase and Bitcoin calls to trade like that. I'm currently still bullish on Bitcoin as I laid out in Potential Interesting Way To Gain Bitcoin Exposure. Key reasons: 1) Bitcoin ETF inflows are very strong this year. Below; assets under management for the two largest players. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ): Data by YCharts 2) Institutional adoption continues with RIA's increasingly allocating client portfolios to crypto. 3) Potentially Bitcoin is in a high profit/low volatility phase (coined by Fidelity). Somewhat confirmed by the low implied vol on both CONY as well as IBIT. 4) Bitcoin supply on exchanges going down, indicating a preference for long-term hodling over trading. 5) Expect Strategy ( MSTR ) to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin as long as its share price remains buoyant. On May 26, the firm reported having issued shares to buy another 4k Bitcoins. Seeking Alpha data shows its momentum as A+ and as long as it continues to run, I expect it to keep buying. Either financed by equity issuance or (convertible) debt. 6) Global money supply increased during April: Global money supply (MicroMacro) My enthusiasm is somewhat decreased because June is generally quite bad. I'm temporarily lowering my buy rating to hold. Right now, I rate these related assets as follows (with the caveat I can easily revert Bitcoin back to a buy in June): Asset Rating Coinbase Hold Bitcoin Hold CONY Sell I'm not a huge fan of most of the crypto-related equities. I think it is more important to avoid Strategy than Coinbase. From my latest note on MSTY : ...it owns around 500k Bitcoins. These are worth roughly speaking $40 billion. Meanwhile, the company's enterprise value is around $78 billion... But until the next Coinbase earnings call (Seeking Alpha data has it on 8/7/2025) the stock likely correlates highly to Bitcoin. I'd rather just be long Bitcoin without the execution risk at the company level. However, I don't expect it to perform badly while Bitcoin is doing well. It is really the valuation (D by Seeking Alpha) and the fact I don't really believe in the long term competitive advantage that usually keeps me from rating Coinbase equal to Bitcoin. This time I'll keep COIN at hold because I prefer it over CONY and don't want to lower the latter towards a strong sell. The main reasons I rate CONY lower are the systematic covered-call strategy while AUM is increasing rapidly, the low IV on Coinbase stock and the seasonal headwinds.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791540-cony-sky-high-payouts-but-near-term-uncertainty-rising?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","IBIT|FBTC|MSTR|COIN|CONY",cryptocompare

This drop comes after a $161 million whale transfer and $323 million in net realized losses, indicating pressure from large holders. Whale Alert reported a transfer of nearly 1 million SOL tokens, indicating cautious sentiment amid ongoing macro volatility. On-chain data confirms the trend: SOL broke below critical support, including the 34-day EMA at $163.20. Volume has spiked, and selling is intense. However, SOL is still in a key support zone between $150 and $156, supported by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. 999,998 #SOL (161,023,918 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/5b34UlPewX — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 30, 2025 Whale transfer: $161 million SOL moved Realized losses: $323 million at the $156 level Critical support: $150-$156, major moving averages $SOL looking shaky rn net realized PnL just flipped red for the first time in nearly 2 months $323M in losses at $156 Sellers are starting to fold just like before that Feb-March dump Not calling full capitulation yet but this setup feels way too familiar imo pic.twitter.com/kQEiLNL0Yb — Trade Byte (@Official3Byte) May 31, 2025 Chainlink CCIP and Solana App Kit Bring Optimism Despite the sell-off, Solana’s fundamentals are strong.

On the 2-hour chart, Solana’s price is stuck in a descending channel, characterized by lower highs and lows, indicating clear selling pressure. The 50-period EMA at $160.79, once support, is now resistance. The MACD is bearish, MACD line below signal line and red histogram bars. Price is approaching the $150.66 support zone, the lower boundary of the channel. If a bullish reversal candle, such as a Hammer or Bullish Engulfing, forms here with MACD convergence, we could see a move to $158.33 or $160.79. But a clean break below $150.66 could take SOL to $142.14 or $134.01. Key Technical Levels: Support: $150.66, $142.14, $134.01 Resistance: $158.33, $160.79, $165.59 For traders, wait for confirmation—rising volume and a bullish candle—before going long. Without that, SOL is bearish, but a textbook rebound at $150 could be a good entry. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.67M Mark as 62% APY Staking Draws Interest With SOL/USD dipping below $160, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $ 50,000 BTC increase, reducing the supply. The current token price is at $0.00254 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to investors seeking yield without complex requirements or the risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,632,712/ $7,676,876 Token price : $0.00254 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~62% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees.

2025-06-01T15:00:01,"Czech Justice Minister Resigns After Accepting Bitcoin from Convicted Criminal","Czech Republic’s Justice Minister, Pavel Blazek, has stepped down amid growing backlash over the sale of nearly $45 million worth of Bitcoin donated by a convicted drug trafficker. The resignation, announced on May 30, follows a police investigation into the source of the cryptocurrency and mounting political pressure just months ahead of national elections. The scandal erupted after the Justice Ministry announced on May 28 via X that it had auctioned off 500 Bitcoin, raising almost 1 billion Czech koruna (approximately $45 million). The funds were intended for projects such as improving prison infrastructure, digitizing the justice system, and reducing drug use in correctional facilities. However, a report by local media outlet Denik N revealed that the cryptocurrency came from Tomas Jirikovsky — the operator of Sheep Marketplace, a dark web platform infamous for hosting illicit drug and weapons sales. Jirikovsky, convicted in 2017, served time for crimes including embezzlement and drug trafficking. Bitcoin ‘Gift’ Raises Eyes on Czech Justice Minister The controversy intensified after it emerged that Blazek accepted the donation without verifying its origin. Jirikovsky’s lawyer had approached the ministry in March, offering one-third of his remaining Bitcoin holdings as a donation. Blazek, defending his decision, claimed he had “no way to investigate the matter” and assumed it was an act of repentance. “I wasn’t interested so many years after the case,” Blazek told reporters at a press conference. “It was his decision to make amends.” The public, however, reacted sharply to the perceived negligence. Opposition leaders branded the move a scandal, criticizing the lack of due diligence in accepting cryptocurrency from a known criminal. Police have now opened an investigation into the true origin of the Bitcoin. Jirikovsky has reportedly been trying to reclaim 1,500 Bitcoin seized at the time of his arrest. Although authorities suspected his crypto holdings were linked to other dark web operations like Nucleus, the court ultimately ruled he could keep the coins after his release in 2021 due to insufficient proof of illegality. Blazek Steps Down as Crypto Rules Take Shape As the political fallout grew, Prime Minister Petr Fiala distanced himself from Blazek, a long-time ally. To preserve the government’s credibility, Blazek announced his resignation. “I am not aware of any illegal action. However, I do not wish to damage the reputation of the government,” he said in a statement. His resignation comes at a time when Czechia is beginning to define its crypto policy framework. In February, President Petr Pavel signed into law new cryptocurrency regulations aligned with the European Union’s MiCA guidelines. The law aims to clarify taxation and promote innovation in the blockchain sector, signaling Czech’s forward-looking approach to digital assets .

2025-06-01T14:54:45,"AI Trading Bots for Risk-Adjusted Returns in Crypto","While most crypto traders fixate on maximum returns, professional investors focus on risk-adjusted performance—the returns generated relative to the risks taken. Cryptocurrency markets present unique challenges with their extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and 24/7 trading cycles. AI trading systems excel in this environment by maintaining consistent risk parameters regardless of market conditions. A properly configured DeFi trading bot applies mathematical precision to risk management tasks that human traders often compromise during emotional market phases. This article examines how AI trading bots implement sophisticated risk-adjusted strategies and the metrics to evaluate their effectiveness. Risk-Adjusted Returns in Crypto Markets Risk-adjusted returns measure investment performance accounting for the risk assumed to generate those returns. Unlike absolute returns, which only show profits, risk-adjusted metrics provide context for those gains. Key risk-adjusted performance indicators include: Sharpe Ratio: Returns beyond risk-free rate divided by standard deviation of returns Sortino Ratio: Similar to Sharpe but only considers downside deviation Maximum Drawdown: Largest percentage drop from peak to subsequent trough Calmar Ratio: Annual return divided by maximum drawdown Ulcer Index: Measures drawdown pain over time Crypto markets demand specialized risk assessment due to their fat-tailed distribution patterns—extreme events occur more frequently than traditional financial models predict. While HODLing crypto assets has historically produced strong overall returns, the journey includes drawdowns exceeding 85% during bear markets. AI trading strategies typically target more modest returns with significantly reduced drawdowns, resulting in superior risk-adjusted performance. Key Risk Management Capabilities of AI Trading Bots AI trading bots implement programmatic risk management through several core capabilities: Position Sizing Algorithms: Automatically adjust trade size based on volatility metrics, reducing exposure during turbulent markets. Dynamic Stop-Loss Systems: Continuously recalculate optimal stop-loss levels using standard deviation bands, support/resistance levels, or volatility-based approaches. Correlation-Based Hedging: Monitor relationships between assets to prevent overexposure to single risk factors. Drawdown Controls: Implement trading size reductions after losses to preserve capital during drawdowns. Tail Risk Detection: Use machine learning to identify patterns preceding major market dislocations. Volatility-Responsive Trading Strategies Volatility forms the cornerstone of risk-adjusted trading systems. Advanced bots implement: Volatility Bands Trading: Only entering positions when market volatility falls within predetermined ranges, avoiding both extremely quiet markets (insufficient movement) and chaotic conditions (excessive risk). ATR-Based Position Sizing: Using Average True Range to establish position sizes proportional to market noise, reducing allocations when volatility expands. Regime-Switching Models: Implementing different parameter sets for distinct volatility regimes, automatically shifting between aggressive, moderate, and defensive postures. Volatility Trend Analysis: Analyzing directional changes in volatility to predict potential market regime shifts before they fully materialize. AI-Powered Risk Assessment Techniques AI systems continuously evaluate market conditions to adjust risk parameters using: Regime Classification: Machine learning models categorize current market conditions into distinct regimes (trending, ranging, volatile) based on dozens of technical factors. Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised learning algorithms flag unusual market behavior that doesn't match historical patterns, triggering defensive measures. NLP Sentiment Analysis : Monitoring news and social media sentiment to adjust risk exposure when negative sentiment spikes precede potential downturns. Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis: Tracking dynamic relationships between cryptocurrencies, detecting when typically uncorrelated assets move together — a warning sign of systemic risk. Machine Learning Models for Risk Profiling Specific machine learning approaches deliver superior risk assessment: Gaussian Mixture Models: Identify distinct market volatility regimes without requiring labeled data. LSTM Networks: Predict volatility spikes by recognizing temporal patterns in market data sequences. Random Forest Classifiers: Rank feature importance to identify which indicators currently drive market risk. Reinforcement Learning: Discover optimal risk-reward tradeoffs through experience, optimizing for Sharpe ratio rather than absolute returns. Implementing Risk-Adjusted Bot Strategies Practical implementation of risk-adjusted trading bots requires specific configuration approaches: Calibrate risk parameters first, then optimize for returns—not vice versa. Start with maximum drawdown limits, then adjust other parameters to maximize returns within these constraints. Backtest across multiple market regimes with emphasis on stress periods. A strategy should demonstrate resilience during crashes, not just performance during uptrends. Implement gradual capital deployment through dollar-cost averaging into positions rather than taking full-size entries. Employ time-based risk adjustments, reducing position sizes during historically volatile time periods (like weekend markets or around major economic announcements). Configure cross-market hedging to offset directional exposure when correlation between assets increases. Position Sizing and Risk Allocation Position sizing represents the most powerful risk management tool available: Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing: $Position = \frac{Account \times Risk%}{Volatility \times Stop Distance}$ Risk Parity Approach: Allocate capital inverse to asset volatility, giving more stable assets larger allocations. Correlation-Weighted Exposure: Reduce aggregate positions in highly correlated assets to prevent overexposure to single risk factors. Maximum Drawdown Recovery Sizing: Scale position sizes relative to distance from maximum equity peak, reducing exposure after drawdowns. Measuring Bot Performance Through Risk-Adjusted Metrics Evaluate bot performance using risk-adjusted metrics rather than absolute returns: Track monthly Sharpe and Sortino ratios with a target of consistently maintaining values above 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. Compare maximum drawdown percentage against absolute returns. Professional strategies typically target annual returns at least twice their maximum drawdown. Monitor recovery time after drawdowns—the period required to reach new equity highs after losses. Analyze performance variation across market regimes to identify strategy blind spots. Even slight underperformance during certain market phases is acceptable if the strategy demonstrates strong risk-adjusted returns overall. Case Study: AI Bot Performance During Market Stress During the May 2021 crypto crash, when Bitcoin fell 53% from its peak, several AI trading strategies demonstrated superior risk management: Early Reduction of Exposure: Machine learning models detected anomalous market conditions 12-24 hours before the major crash, automatically reducing position sizes. Volatility-Based Position Sizing: Strategies employing volatility-adjusted position sizing automatically reduced trade size as market turbulence increased. Correlation-Based Risk Management: Systems monitoring inter-market correlations detected unusual synchronization across assets and implemented defensive measures. Recovery Positioning: While human traders often remained sidelined after the crash, AI systems methodically re-entered positions at technical support levels, capturing the subsequent recovery. The most successful systems maintained drawdowns below 15% during this period, compared to the broader market's 50%+ decline. Conclusion: Balancing Risk and Return in Automated Trading Effective AI trading bots prioritize risk management over profit maximization. Configure systems to target consistent, moderate returns with minimal drawdowns rather than maximum possible gains. Evaluate performance through risk-adjusted metrics rather than absolute returns, and ensure your strategy performs adequately across all market regimes. Remember that the most successful automated trading approach isn't necessarily the one with the highest returns during bull markets, but the one that preserves capital during downturns while delivering acceptable performance over complete market cycles.

2025-06-01T14:45:19,"XRP Price Prediction: Price Hovering Around $2.16 – Is XRP Building the Strength Needed to Break $3?","XRP is currently trading at $2.16, up 0.66% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of over $1.82 billion. The recent price move is on the back of Bitcoin’s slight gain, but XRP’s fundamentals are quietly improving. Ripple’s active role in exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is boosting optimism. France is exploring the use of the XRP Ledger for digital currency trials, while Georgia’s central bank is already collaborating with Ripple on similar initiatives.

The descending trendline is applying pressure, and the 50-period EMA at $2.2469 is acting as dynamic resistance. The price structure is exhibiting lower highs and lower lows, with strong selling momentum. But recent candlestick formations, Doji and Spinning Top patterns, are hinting at a pause. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview MACD indicators are bearish, the MACD line is below the signal line, and the histogram bars are red. XRP is currently above a key support zone between $2.0814 and $2.0209, an area of previous buying interest.

2025-06-01T14:41:30,"Expert Predicts When XRP Will Bottom for Next Rally","Renowned Crypto analyst, WatersAbove, has laid out a bold prediction for XRP’s near-term price action, sparking significant interest within the XRP community. According to WatersAbove’s statement on X, XRP is expected to hit its bottom between June 4th and June 6th, setting the stage for what could be one of the most anticipated rallies in the token’s recent history. With eyes set on a breakout to $10 by late July or early August, the XRP Army is buzzing with anticipation, but also caution, as the analyst warns of significant market manipulation in the days ahead. Dear #XRPArmy the bottom on XRP should be in by June 4th – 6th after June 18th, expect a straight line breakout to $10 by late July / early August in the meantime, watch out for this week ahead June 3rd – 6th will be heavy manipulation — WatersAbove (@WatersAbve) May 31, 2025 June Bottom: The Setup for the Next Surge WatersAbove’s forecast suggests that the XRP price floor will lock in between June 4th and 6th, a timeframe that aligns with broader market shifts anticipated across the crypto space. This bottoming phase is critical, as it may offer the last opportunity for accumulation before XRP begins a major upward trajectory. XRP’s past performance has shown cycles of price suppression followed by sudden breakouts, a trend closely monitored by traders and long-term investors. What makes this forecast particularly compelling is the specificity of the timing. Rather than offering vague “sometime this summer” predictions, WatersAbove narrows it down to a window of just a few days, suggesting that key market signals, possibly linked to on-chain data, liquidity patterns, or technical setups, are pointing to this narrow band as the inflection point. Anticipating the Breakout to $10 Following the anticipated bottom, WatersAbove predicts a straight-line breakout after June 18th, with XRP rocketing toward the $10 mark by late July or early August. If realized, this would represent a staggering multi-fold increase from current price levels, signaling a decisive shift in XRP’s market dynamics. This projection doesn’t come out of thin air. Over the past year, Ripple has seen growth in its international partnerships and the broader adoption of XRP for cross-border payments. Despite Ripple’s notable legal victories, the market hasn’t yet fully reflected these positive developments in its pricing. A breakout to $10 would signal not just speculative excitement, but a recalibration of XRP’s value in light of Ripple’s expanding global role. Short-Term Risks: Manipulation Ahead The long-term outlook from WatersAbove is bullish, but the short-term cautionary notes are equally significant. According to the analyst, the period between June 3rd and June 6th will be marked by heavy market manipulation. This warning highlights the importance of vigilance for traders and investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In past cycles, XRP has been no stranger to volatility, often whipsawing in response to news events, coordinated whale activity, or even broader market corrections tied to Bitcoin’s price movements. Heavy manipulation can manifest in sudden price dumps, fake breakouts, or misleading on-chain activity, all of which can shake out weak hands and confuse market participants. WatersAbove’s warning serves as a reminder that while the path to $10 may be paved with opportunity, it’s also lined with traps designed to derail the impatient or ill-prepared. Broader Context: Why This Rally Matters If WatersAbove’s predictions hold, XRP’s potential rally to $10 would not only be a price milestone but a symbolic one. XRP has long held a distinct place in the crypto landscape, serving both as a utility token for Ripple’s payment solutions and as a focal point in regulatory discussions around digital assets. Achieving a $10 price point would push XRP’s market capitalization deep into the top ranks of the crypto leaderboard, potentially reigniting debates about its role as a bridge currency for global finance. Moreover, such a surge would come at a time when the broader crypto market is poised for renewed institutional interest, particularly as the U.S. advances its regulatory frameworks and spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs gain traction. XRP’s rally could further spotlight altcoins with strong utility and regulatory clarity, setting the stage for a broader shift in market sentiment.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 153,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on Bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator on the weekly chart. The MACD is a technical indicator that tracks the convergence and divergence of moving averages to gauge an asset’s momentum and trend direction while pinpointing potential reversal areas. According to Dave the Wave, BTC’s weekly MACD suggests that Bitcoin is bullish and is primed to hit a diagonal resistance that has marked market tops since 2012. “On the basis of the weekly BTC MACD extension, you’d expect another push up.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that the MACD will rise to the diagonal resistance by the end of the year, just as BTC rallies to $160,000. Zooming out, Dave the Wave says the monthly time frame supports his long-term bullish outlook on BTC. “Longer-term monthly BTC MACD turning upward again…” Source: Dave the Wave/X But in the short term, the analyst thinks that Bitcoin will slide to around $98,000, where it could potentially print a local bottom before sparking new rallies. “Would it be such a terrible thing to see BTC price consolidate to just under $100,000 before moving up again?

2025-06-01T14:30:00,"Cardano support crumbles as whales hit the sell button","Cardano price has slipped in the past few weeks, and the sell-off may continue after it dropped below key support levels and as whales started to capitulate. Cardano ( ADA ) price dropped for five consecutive days, reaching a low of $0.65, its lowest level since May 8. It has dropped by over 21% from its highest point in May and by 50% from its November 2024 high. On-chain data shows that Cardano’s investors have started to capitulate. According to Santiment , the number of ADA holders has dropped to 4.49 million, down from 4.55 million at the highest point in May. More data shows that whales have continued to sell their coins, sign that they expect its price to continue falling. Whales holding between 100 million and 1 billion coins hold 3.02 billion coins today, down from a high of 3.4 billion in April. Cardano whale transactions | Source: Santiment Similarly, those holding between 1 million and 10 million have reduced their holdings to 5.7 billion from the year-to-date high of 6 billion. These sales happened as the number of ADA tokens in profit dropped to 22.69 billion from 27 billion in April. Cardano, once touted as a viable alternative to Ethereum, has continued to underperform across all areas. Its total value locked in decentralized finance has dropped to $391 million, while its cumulative DEX transactions stand at $4 billion. In contrast, Unichain has a TVL of over $702 million, and its DEX volume has jumped to over $14 billion, a few months after its launch. Cardano is now pegging its growth to its integration with Bitcoin ( BTC ), a move it expects will boost its TVL by billions . The argument is that incorporating Bitcoin will enable BTC holders to stake their holdings and earn rewards. However, this technology already exists, and Bitcoin staking platforms like SolvProtocol and Lombard Finance hold billions in assets. You might also like: Can XRP fall back to $2.20? Ripple foundation making moves Cardano price technical analysis ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ADA price has crashed in the past few days. This sell-off continued after it formed a double-top pattern at $0.839. It has now moved below this pattern’s neckline at $0.710, confirming its bearish bias. Cardano has also plunged below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and is at risk of forming a death cross. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling as sellers target the psychological point at $0.50, down by 25% below the current level. Cardano audit Cardano also finds itself on the receiving end of damning allegations made by non-fungible token artist Masato Alexander. Founder Charles Hoskinson , Alexander alleges, misappropriated $619 million in ADA tokens. Hoskinson denied the allegations. An audit is currently in the works to debunk the claims, he said. If the audit clears the project of these accusations, investors’ confidence could be restored, triggering a strong rebound in Cardano. However, if the findings raise further concerns, ADA may continue in its recent downtrend. The allegations center on a 318 million ADA transfer during the 2021 Allegra hard fork. Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, launched the project in 2015. The Cardano blockchain officially went live on Sept. 29, 2017. Hoskinson founded the Cardano protocol through IOHK, or Input Output Hong Kong, a blockchain research and engineering company he co-founded with Jeremy Wood. The project was named after Gerolamo Cardano, a 16th-century Italian mathematician, and its native cryptocurrency, ADA, was named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician often credited as the first computer programmer.

On Sunday, the Bitcoin price prediction is mixed as BTC consolidates in a narrow range of $ 105,000 to $10,350. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is testing a downward sloping trendline, with the 50-period EMA at $106,331 capping the rally. A Doji at $104,894 is a sign of indecision, while a lower high pattern indicates a potential continuation of the downtrend. The MACD is bearish, with a deep red histogram and a widening gap below the signal line. Levels to watch: Support: $103,501, $102,141 Resistance: $106,331, $107,914 A reversal at $103,501 (Hammer or Bullish Engulfing with MACD convergence) could spark a move to $106,331 or higher. Until then, be careful. For traders, it’s simple: wait for a breakout or reversal. Without confirmation, bearish.

Local news outlet Le Monde shared the report, citing an announcement from the Paris public prosecutor’s office. According to previous reports, there has been an increase in the number of crypto-related kidnappings targeting prominent crypto personalities and their relatives since the beginning of the year in Paris. The prosecutor’s office mentioned that the suspects are between the ages of 16 and 23, with about six minors in the mix. The report mentioned that 18 suspects have now been placed in pre-trial detention, three have requested a deferred hearing, while four remain under judicial supervision. France charges 25 suspects in connection with crypto-related kidnappings According to the report, the investigation centers on the botched abduction attempt in Paris’ 11th arrondissement, which occurred on May 13. The targets were the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of the French cryptocurrency exchange Paymium. Although the assailants were able to escape after the failed attempt, they did enough to leave visible damage in their wake, with the husband of the target being hit on the head and eyewitnesses mentioning that blood was everywhere. Authorities mentioned that that was not the first crypto-related kidnapping attempt, with a similar failed attempt being staged the previous day, and the police foiling one some days later. The suspects, according to the report, were from diverse backgrounds, including individuals born in the Paris region, Châtellerault, Senegal, Angola, and Russia. According to the defense attorneys, most of the suspects were young, describing them as “young profiles lured by money and caught in a situation beyond their control.” The Paris case is not the first, as it is part of a rise in crypto-related kidnappings across the country this year. Several high-profile individuals have been affected by the ongoing menace, including Ledger co-founder David Balland and his partner. Another one occurred on May 1, which involved the father of a crypto millionaire in the city. The criminals were said to have carried out brutal attacks on the father, mutilating him to force his son to pay the ransom for his release. Investigators also say the case is linked to the current wave of attacks. French minister convenes urgent meeting, insurance companies to cover risks According to the police, while they have been able to apprehend some of the goons used in wreaking this havoc, the mastermind behind the operations remains unidentified. The incident has also drawn national attention, with France’s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau meeting with crypto industry professionals to discuss protective measures. The ministry later released a memo mentioning enhanced cooperation between law enforcement and crypto firms, including home security checks conducted by the police and gendarmerie officers. Meanwhile, insurers are developing new protections aimed at the growing physical threat against their clients in the target demography. According to a report by NBC News, more than three firms specializing in crypto insurance and security are now preparing tailored kidnap and ransom (K&R) policies for cryptocurrency investors. At the same time, crypto executives and investors have been seeking personal security services for their protection.

Related Reading: Pepe Makes It To Trump’s Feed—Is A Crypto Endorsement Next? According to Keiser’s May 30 X post, Saylor kept buying Bitcoin through past market drops without selling, even when his holdings were underwater. He pointed out that Strategy’s imitators have yet to face a real bear market. Based on this, Keiser warned it might be unrealistic to assume these newer firms will stay steady if prices slide. Max Keiser Raises Doubts In a May 30 X post, Keiser wrote, “The Strategy clones have not been tested in a bear market. Saylor never sold and just kept buying, even when his BTC position was underwater. It is foolish to think the new Bitcoin Treasury Strategy clones will have the same discipline.” The @Strategy clones have not been tested in a bear market.@saylor never sold, and just kept buying, even when his BTC position was under water. It’s foolish to think the new Bitcoin Treasury @Strategy clones will have the same discipline. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) May 31, 2025 He had already compared Strategy to “the Bitcoin of BTC treasury plays,” implying that other firms will struggle to match that level of conviction. Short trades and quick flips have driven some copycats so far. Long holds in a downtrend? That’s a different story. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Soar Companies are jumping on the Bitcoin treasury train at a rapid pace. Based on reports, dozens of businesses announced plans to follow Strategy’s lead in the first half of 2025. Some analysts now believe 50% or more of all crypto could soon sit on corporate balance sheets. Strive, the asset management firm led by former political candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, joined on May 7.

Based on reports, analysts argue such high premiums can’t last forever. If Bitcoin dips or demand for stock‐based exposure weakens, those markups could evaporate.

The highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) will attract large crypto and traditional finance firms. This follows a thickening institutional plot in the crypto market, adding an extra layer of legitimacy for the high-flying assets. Big Firms Eye Circle’s IPO BlackRock is preparing to acquire part of Circle’s shares in its upcoming IPO, Bloomberg reported , citing sources familiar with the matter. Per a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Circle’s Chief Executive, Jeremy Allaire, plans to raise about $624 million in the IPO. The deal, which is expected on June 4, has recorded multiple orders for the shares available. The sources said the deal’s details are not finalized, and the $9 trillion asset manager could swoop in for a stake through another vehicle or opt out entirely. BlackRock and Circle are not strangers, as previous deals have already been struck. BlackRock manages a money market fund for Circle that backs the USDC stablecoin. The Fund now holds approximately $53.5 billion. USDC adoption is projected to build on gains in the past three quarters. Recent institutional developments in the United States, with its user base soaring, are tipped to favor the asset. Incoming stablecoin rules will also push its compliance in multiple jurisdictions. Circle initially filed for its IPO on April 1 but delayed due to rising economic concerns amid US tariff wars. The company has attracted big crypto firms like Ripple and Coinbase as users flock to its USDC stablecoin. Fortune reported informal sale talks with Coinbase and Ripple. However, Circle insisted it was not for sale following reports of a $4 billion bid deemed too low. According to the rebuttals, Circle remains committed to its long-term goals. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is also preparing a $150 million swoop in Circle’s IPO. Community Expresses Optimism Over Soaring Adoption Digital asset traders remain thrilled as more institutional investors increase their exposure to the crypto market. According to experts, inflows have positioned assets for major upswings in Q2 2025. From investment in Bitcoin mining firms to stablecoin issuers, traditional players have raised the bar.

This rebound comes on the heels of a broader market downturn that saw TON decline alongside other major cryptocurrencies late last week. Amidst these small-scale movements, crypto analyst Ali Martinez notes the altcoin appears to be preparing for a major price breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News Toncoin Charts 40% Move As Triangle Hints At Breakout In an X post on May 31, Ali Martinez shares an insightful take on the TON market. Using the 4-hour trading chart, the expert analyst highlights that TON’s price movement over the past four months has created a symmetrical triangle pattern hinting at the strong potential of a major price breakout. The symmetrical triangle is a neutral chart pattern that reflects price compression due to the formation of higher lows and lower highs. Inherently, this chart pattern suggests neither the buyers or sellers are in affirmative control of the market, indicating there is much potential for a 40% price swing on either side. Currently, Toncoin trades around $3.16 following the recent price bounce. If market bulls force a breakout from the upper boundary around $3.28, the altcoin is expected to trade as high as $4.55-$4.65. Meanwhile, a breakdown at the lower boundary around $3.10 could result in a market price between $1.80-$1.90. Interestingly, TON’s relative strength index currently sits at 49.37 facing the upward direction which also suggests a neutral market while noting that bullish momentum is starting to build. A cross over 50 would provide bulls confirmation as TON makes its way to the overbought zone. Related Reading: Tron (TRX) Future Retail Activity Indicates More Gains Ahead – Analyst TON Market Overview As earlier stated, TON continues to trade at $3.16 reflecting market gains of 5.12% and 4.62% in the past one and seven days, respectively.

Many retail traders started doing the exact opposite of his recommendations, and the idea became so famous that an “Inverse Cramer ETF” was launched (it was later shut down, but the meme lives on). Now, crypto traders might have found their new ""Inverse Jim Cramer"" in James Wynn's trading wallet . ""The winning strategy lately? Do the opposite of James Wynn,"" s aid blockchain sleuth Lookonchain in an X post, pointing to a trader who has been making millions by doing exactly the opposite of James Wynn's trades. ""0x2258 has been counter-trading James Wynn—shorting when James Wynn goes long, and going long when James Wynn shorts. In the past week, 0x2258 has made ~$17M, while James Wynn has lost ~$98M,"" Lookonchain said in the post. Seventeen million dollars in a week just by inverse-betting on one trader is not a bad payday. However, this might be a short-term trade, and one should be very cautious as things can change lightning fast in the trading world, leaving punters millions in losses if not hedged properly. Even James Wynn said, ""I’ll run it back, I always do. And I’ll enjoy doing it. I like playing the game,” after the trader got fully liquidated over the weekend . So, maybe this Reddit gem : ""How much money would you have made if you did the exact opposite of Jim Cramer?"" would never translate to include James Wynn.

However, as the big bull continues its unwavering streak, alternative tokens fail to follow the asset’s direction. Ripple’s XRP , a leading altcoin, was one of many that failed to meet market expectations last week. Despite this, market analysts’ sentiments are firmly within bullish territory. Egrag Crypto, a prominent analyst in the X crypto space, has made an assertion validating multiple bullish possibilities for the asset. The analyst revisits XRP’s 2017 performance and explains that a breakout could be around the corner if the altcoin mimics historical patterns. “If XRP is repeating the last section or pattern from October 2017, we might be on the brink of a major breakout soon! Back in October 2017, XRP took roughly 63 days to explode and set a new all-time high, skyrocketing by an astonishing 1,772%!” He wrote. The analyst added that if XRP follows this pattern, the asset could reach the $27 mark in the next few months. He points to the 21-week EMA as a virtual support level and a last line of defense for the XRP. As such, remaining above the $2.30 price mark could sustain the bullish momentum. For the bullish breakout to occur, XRP bulls are expected to close above the Fib 1.414 level around the $2.70 price mark, which would be indicative of a strong bullish signal going forward. The ultimate target, however, is a break above the $3.00 high reached in February. The analyst remains convinced that this move could happen in the near term. “Cycle analysis: If we mirror October 2017’s duration, the peak might occur around July 21, 2025 — roughly two months from now! A cycle top in July suggests BTC may also challenge new ATHs within the next 40 days.” He concluded.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-27-moonshot-analyst-predicts-1772-explosion-following-2017-historical-pattern/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-01T12:29:00,"Bitcoin’s Year-End Price Prediction Comes in Hot With Experts Pointing to $200,000","Bitcoin’s rise to the $111,970 price mark has left market participants even more optimistic for the third and final quarters, with fresh bullish price forecasts frequently making the rounds. While the predictions accommodate both bullish and bearish possibilities, price forecasts are going up to $200,000 as an attainable level in 2025. Identifying the factors validating this potential outcome, prominent analyst TradingShot first observed that the BTCUSD pair is experiencing the weakest bull cycle in history, which he believes is a “product of the Theory of Diminishing Returns (TDM).” Notably, the first market cycles appeared to have been more aggressive, with incoming gains hitting rooftop levels, as the market’s upside potential seemed larger in its beginning stages. The analyst revisited the 2025 to 2017 and 2019 to 2021 bull cycles, stating that these periods were in harmony with the traditional capital market. However, the market seems to be headed in a different direction now. “ The current Cycle (2023 – 2025), following the late February 2025 divergence, is now attempting to converge again with its strong rebound in the past 6 weeks. Being however within a Channel Up throughout the entirety of the Cycle, it appears that it will do so in a structured way and as the ( Theory of Diminishing Returns) TDM suggests, will offer weaker gains.” He asserted . He conclusively deduces the timing of the Cycle Top by referring to previous market cycles, projecting that this time, the bull cycle could reach the top between October, November, or December. At this time, the asset is supposed to have hit its peak, around the $150,000 to $200,000 price range.

2025-06-01T12:26:00,"Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Stuck? ChatGPT Weighs In","TL;DR Bitcoin charted a new all-time high, and even Ethereum managed to post some impressive gains in the past month. However, Ripple’s cross-border token has failed to recapture any of its previous momentum. Here’s what ChatGPT thinks about the current situation and what might be the cause of it. Also, will there be a breakout soon? Current Price Landscape Numerous prominent crypto analysts have outlined in the past several weeks how important the support levels of $2.3 and $2 are for XRP’s future price movements. The former, though, has already been broken to the downside and many of them believe the asset is primed for another retracement toward the latter. Recall that the last time XRP slumped beneath $2 was in early April as the financial world braced for the impact of Trump’s growing and constant tariffs against essentially every country. Although the economic situation improved dramatically in the following two months and many cryptocurrencies, such as the aforementioned new BTC peak and ETH’s revival, marked impressive gains, XRP remained on the sidelines to some extent and was quickly stopped during its surge toward $2.6. It was (and still remains) confined in a descending pattern that has seen another 6.5% decline on a weekly scale. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Why So? ChatGPT first listed the broader market conditions as one of the reasons behind XRP’s stagnation, but that sounds accurate only if we take into account the past week, in which many digital assets have turned red. However, XRP has been outperformed by ETH, BTC, and many, many alts, such as HYPE , on a monthly scale as well. The AI solution noted that investor sentiment and behavior have changed lately toward XRP, as the post-US election hype has evaporated. Now, even though Ripple essentially won its legal fight against the SEC, investors are “opting to sell during minor price increases rather than holding for long-term gains.” ChatGPT mentioned XRP’s tokenomics, in which a billion new coins are released monthly. According to its answer, this continues to add selling pressure for XRP and may hinder its progress. “This consistent increase in available tokens can suppress price growth, especially if demand doesn’t keep pace.” On the question of what could help XRP break out of its consolidation, the AI chatbot said it might take a significant change in investor behavior, such as whales going on a massive accumulation spree similar to the one at the end of 2024, as well as an overall improvement in the market. Additionally, big partnership or acquisitions can aso fuel a new rally. The post Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Stuck?

2025-06-01T12:16:33,"Anthony Scaramucci says Solana will Seamlessly Substitute Banks for IPOs","SkyBridge’s Anthony Scaramucci, while speaking at the Solana Accelerate conference, made some key predictions about the Solana ecosystem. Scaramucci most notably affirmed that bringing Initial public offerings (IPOs) on-chain is possible and allows non-traditional users affiliated with banks to purchase IPOs through their wallets. “You can actually crowdsource the public offering through the tokenization process.” He remarked. When asked about the state of institutional investors and their interest levels in Solana, he revealed that he was authoring a book on Solana titled “Solana Rising”. While interviewing Chief Technology Officers around Wall Street for the book, he revealed that Solana’s scale, functionality, affordability, and throughput position the network to become one of the principal rail systems. “If Bitcoin is the operating layer for money, Solana will be the operating layer for real-world assets, stocks, bonds, and tokenization.” He asserted. Speaking of skeptics, particularly Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who maintains that he is not a fan of Bitcoin and has shown almost no interest in the broader crypto market, Scaramucci believes he will “come around.” He explains that Dimon, surrounded by Senator Elizabeth Warren, tasked with regulating the financial system, is understandably “towing the line.” He further credits the Trump administration for reshaping the system. Scaramucci conclusively disclosed that he and Michael Saylor are fixed on the process of assets transitioning into yield-bearing assets. “Solana certainly, you have the staking situation, but Solana is going to be a healthy enough operating system where you’re going to be able to lend your Solana out, go to a Goldman Sachs of crypto, like a Galaxy, post up your Solana. Sure, you’ll get your staking, but you will also be able to lend it out and get yield in addition to that.” He remarked.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/anthony-scaramucci-says-solana-will-seamlessly-substitute-banks-for-ipos/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TECHNOLOGY","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare
2025-06-01T12:16:14,"European champion, PSG taps RTB Digital to launch Web3 fan platform","Football powerhouse, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), has entered into a partnership with Web3 firm RTB Digital, launching an initiative off the pitch. According to reports, the partnership has birthed a digital platform for its fans called PSG World. The launch of the PSG World platform was announced earlier, with the platform going live just before the UEFA Champions League final, where its men’s team came out victorious in a 5-0 victory over Italian side Internazionale. According to the club, the latest initiative is a push forward in its strategy to strengthen the relationship between its fans across the world. The platform was also designed to act as a forum for members. PSG launches new platform to strengthen fan relationships According to the football club, the platform will provide a home for its supporters to share their pre-match and post-match thoughts, acting as a commentary center for the fans. Users will also be able to co-create content, access exclusive media, and build global connections around their football club. Speaking at the Bitcoin Conference in 2025, Pär Helgosson, Head of PSG Labs, discussed the vision of the French club for PSG World. The discussion also involved other prominent members of the crypto community, including the founder and CEO of Roundtable, James Heckman, and Managing Partner at Blockchain Founders Fund, Aly Madhavji. “As we look ahead, our mission is to deepen our connection with fans — not just in France, but around the world,” Pär Helgosson said. “And that means meeting them where they are, online, on-chain, and in their culture.” Helgosson also added that one of the issues of today is that clubs don’t try enough to own their audience data, and PSG is planning to fix it with the new platform. “We have all these fans running for us but they’re not always on our platforms,” he said. “The challenge is to build a direct channel — to capture more data, understand our fans better, and engage them in more relevant ways.” According to the club, the platform will be powered by RTB, a SaaS technology company providing full-stack, white-label community and infrastructure for brands, journalists, and creators. RTB’s vision fulfills the dream of premium brands by uniting them under a single Web3 SaaS platform. The architecture also offers an array of features, tools, and distribution assets, which are already being used by several partners. Helgosson says the club will tap its global reach Speaking alongside Madhavji, Helgosson discussed the scale of the club’s audience, noting that the club is as big in all parts of the world as they are in France, even bigger in some places. Heckman also added contact to the club’s global footprint, noting the number of players they have from diverse countries. “A team in Paris has stars from Argentina, Brazil, Italy, England, and Germany. When you claimed half a billion fans, it sounded ludicrous — but it’s actually true,” he said. Founded in 1970, PSG has grown into one of the most recognizable brands in world football. With its digital presence expanding, the club is prepared to unveil this new model of sports engagement. However, the strategy isn’t about just the reach, it is about building a meaningful and persistent relationship with its fans. The platform adds physical, digital, and blockchain-based tools to shape that interaction. “We dominated social, online today. And we also want to dominate in on-chain and all tokenized ways,” Helgosson said. “We want to engage our fan base across what we do offline, online today — and on-chain tomorrow.” Helgosson also mentioned that the club has taken some financial bets on Bitcoin, noting that it took some of its fiat reserves and allocated it into Bitcoin last year. He added that they are the largest club doing it globally.

2025-06-01T11:46:43,"Bitcoin Rich List: Who’s Stacking, Who’s Slacking?","The post Bitcoin Rich List: Who’s Stacking, Who’s Slacking? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In recent months, many major companies around the world have started buying large amounts of Bitcoin. It seems like every few days, there’s news about another business joining the growing list of Bitcoin investors. One of the first big names in this space was MicroStrategy, led by its CEO, Michael Saylor. Years ago, the company began buying Bitcoin, and since then, its stock price has jumped by an incredible 3,000%. Saylor has said he believes other companies will have no choice but to follow, especially as Bitcoin prices keep rising. Why Are More Companies Buying Bitcoin? As explained by an analyst, it’s simple: when a few companies start buying Bitcoin and their stock prices rise, other businesses take notice. Soon, more companies feel pressured to join in, which pushes Bitcoin’s price even higher. As the price rises, it becomes more expensive for new buyers to enter the market, which creates a rush to buy before prices climb further. New Player From Indonesia A company called DigiAsia from Indonesia has just announced its plans to buy $100 million worth of Bitcoin. While it’s not as big as MicroStrategy’s investments, it’s still a huge amount. What’s more surprising is that DigiAsia plans to use 50% of its future profits to keep buying Bitcoin. This shows they’re serious about making cryptocurrency a key part of their financial strategy. More Big Numbers from Other Companies Another company called MetaPlanet has also been making headlines. They want to build a Bitcoin reserve of 10,000 Bitcoins by the end of this year, and 21,000 by the end of next year. Recently, they revealed they’ve already collected over 6,700 Bitcoins — much faster than expected. The big question now is: with Bitcoin’s price expected to rise to around $370,000 to $500,000 by the end of this year, will these companies still be willing to buy more at such high prices? And what will happen if Bitcoin hits $2.4 million by 2029 or 2030, as some predictions suggest? What Does This Mean for Regular Bitcoin Holders? Every time a company buys thousands of Bitcoins, it reduces the number of coins available for everyone else. Some experts have said that one day, even millionaires and billionaires won’t be able to buy a full Bitcoin because so many have been taken off the market by big companies. There’s an old idea in the crypto world that owning just 0.28 Bitcoin would put you in the top 1% of Bitcoin holders. Back then, people thought it was a small number. But with companies grabbing up huge amounts of Bitcoin, that 0.28 BTC is starting to look a lot more valuable. In Short More and more companies are buying Bitcoin as a long-term investment. As these businesses keep adding to their Bitcoin reserves, it could drive prices up and make it harder for others to buy in the future. And if Bitcoin reaches the price levels some experts predict, it’ll make the small amounts of Bitcoin owned by regular investors even more valuable.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-rich-list-whos-stacking-whos-slacking/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-06-01T11:45:46,"Bitcoin May Go Into Imminent Correction Mode for ‘Weeks and Weeks,’ According to Analyst Willy Woo – Here’s Why","Veteran on-chain analyst Willy Woo says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on the edge of moving into a lengthy correction phase. Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that BTC has until Monday to avoid printing a bearish divergence on the weekly chart. A bearish divergence happens when price makes higher highs, while an indicator like the relative strength index (RSI) makes lower highs, suggesting that an asset is losing bullish momentum. Says Woo, “Dear Mr Bitcoin, you have [until Monday] to rally or you’re gonna print a bearish divergence on weekly charts and then we will be bored for weeks and weeks.” Source: Willy Woo/X Using proprietary data from his Bitcoin analysis firm, the Bitcoin Vector, Woo says that BTC appears to be strong, but may be “equalizing” itself after rallying faster than usual in previous months. “Our Bitcoin Vector framework remains strong despite the pullback. What’s happening is technical resistance in the form of a bearish divergence playing out against strong fundamentals. Basically, BTC ran up faster than normal and is equalizing.” Source: Willy Woo/X While many traders are still betting on the traditional halving-based four-year cycles, Woo says BTC is becoming more linked to external macro forces, and that predictable, cyclical price patterns are now a thing of the past. “BTC is global macro this cycle. Which means don’t necessarily bet on nicely manicured four-year cycles. BTC is transitioning. Internal forces, the halvening, are getting weak, global liquidity powers BTC – hence BTC is becoming the canary in the coal mine for global macro moves.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,737 Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The items, sold exclusively via the Bitcoin-only marketplace Scarce City, offered collectors a chance to own a piece of crypto history, just months after Ulbricht was pardoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump. The auction, which included both personal effects from before Ulbricht’s 2013 arrest and memorabilia from his time behind bars, attracted strong interest from the crypto community. Items ranged from a well-worn sleeping bag and backpack to prison clothing, artwork, and even his final prison-issued ID card . “I’ve left Arizona, the state where I was in prison. It’s time to travel. That means downsizing and turning the page,” Ulbricht wrote on the auction page. “I don’t need the reminders and I’m sure some of you will love to have them.” ID Card Sells for Over $1 Million Among the most coveted items was Ulbricht’s final prison ID card, which sold for an astonishing 11 BTC — over $1.1 million at current prices. “The guard tried to get me to stop smiling for the photo, but my joy comes from within,” Ulbricht remarked in a personal note. “So I smiled that day, even though I was in prison.” Another standout was a painting co-created by Ulbricht and a fellow inmate known as “Omega,” which fetched 1.01 BTC. Ulbricht described the piece as a symbol of hope: “It gave me the feeling that, if I could pass through it, something better would be on the other side.” The auction was structured to ensure fairness, requiring a 1% collateral deposit from bidders and a resettable countdown to deter last-minute bid sniping. All payments must be finalized by June 2, with Bitcoin preferred, although small PayPal payments were accepted. Ulbricht Dormant Bitcoin Holdings Beyond the auction, Ulbricht could potentially regain access to millions in dormant Bitcoin. According to Coinbase’s Conor Grogan, about 430 BTC — currently worth around $47 million — remain untouched in wallets tied to Ulbricht that were never seized. Blockchain firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed the findings, identifying 14 such wallets . One of them alone holds over $9 million in BTC. These funds have been inactive for more than 13 years, stirring speculation about their future use following Ulbricht’s release.

2025-06-01T11:39:33,"Top 4 reasons why XRP price may surge 50% in June","XRP remains in a technical bear market after falling 37% from its peak earlier this year. Its price is stuck at the same level where it began the year, underperforming Bitcoin, which has risen 15% in 2025. Ripple ( XRP ) price was trading at $2.140 on Sunday as its volume and futures open interest remained under pressure. This article highlights the top four reasons it may jump by 50% and retest the year-to-date high of $3.4 in June. You might also like: Bitcoin price pulls back as analysts tout $1m–$2.4m potential The Securities and Exchange Commission will decide on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF by June 17. Approval would likely help boost the XRP price because of the expected inflows from Wall Street investors. JPMorgan analysts estimate the fund would attract over $8 billion in funds in the first year. However, the likely scenario is that the SEC delays the approval again, possibly until October. Polymarket traders place the odds of approval by July 31 at 21%, and by the end of the year at 83% . Crypto traders are pricing an eventual XRP price breakout in the coming weeks. The eight-hour funding rate has remained in the positive zone in the past few weeks. A positive funding rate is essential data in perpetual futures, meaning traders anticipate the price to be higher. As we wrote here , there are signs that Bitcoin will make a bullish breakout. We cited the bullish forecasts by top analysts and the fact that it is forming the handle section of the cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern points to an eventual Bitcoin surge to $143,000. A Bitcoin price breakout will likely push other cryptocurrencies, including XRP, higher. The final reason the Ripple price may break out and surge to $3.4 is its strong technicals. See below. XRP funding rate | Source: CoinGlass XRP technicals The accumulation and distribution indicators point to increased accumulation. This means that XRP may now be in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. It will move to the markup, which has higher demand than supply. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The XRP price has remained slightly above the 200-day moving average. It has also formed a giant bullish pennant pattern, comprising a vertical line and a triangle. A pennant often leads to a strong bullish breakout. XRP has also formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. As such, a breakout will see it retest the resistance at $3.3842, up almost 50% from the current level.
