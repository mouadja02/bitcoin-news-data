2025-06-01T06:57:50,"Google Gemini Sets XRP Price for June 30, 2025","As the cryptocurrency market continues its recovery, we’ve checked in with Google Gemini for XRP’s trajectory, looking for a price target for June 30, 2025. XRP has risen over 1.5% from yesterday, and Gemini expects it to continue this climb, predicting a rise from its current price of $2.17 to $3.20 by June 30. According to Gemini, the projected target is based on several key considerations, most notably the current market sentiment, regulatory developments, and adoption. XRP’s Recent Performance Gemini notes that the broader crypto market is in a recovery phase, with Bitcoin leading the trend. XRP has historically moved in line with overall market performance, though often with less intensity. Assuming continued bullish momentum through June, XRP could see notable gains. Gemini’s $3.20 price target represents an increase of more than 47%, and it could set XRP up for further gains. If XRP hits this target, it will be the first time the digital asset has surpassed $3 since its decline in early February . The digital asset experienced a remarkable climb from around $0.55 in November 2024 to $3.39 in January 2025. It took things a step further, closing January above $3—its first monthly close above $3 . However, it has struggled since then. The U.S. economic policies and uncertainty around the lawsuit impacted its performance. Gemini’s prediction suggests the asset’s trajectory is about to turn around, listing some reasons for this bullish outlook. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Contributing to the Bullish Prediction The ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit remains a central factor in XRP’s future valuation. According to Gemini, the decisive end of the lawsuit could create upward momentum for the digital asset. Both parties have agreed to drop their appeals and are working for the approval of their settlement agreement. This agreement involves the removal of the permanent injunction preventing institutional XRP sales and the reduction of Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million. Gemini suggests that the legal clarity from the lawsuit’s conclusion will positively impact investor confidence and price performance. It also highlighted XRP’s role in cross-border payments as a foundational strength, particularly through Ripple’s payment network. As adoption grows , Gemini expects XRP’s price to rise significantly. However, it notes that Ripple will need more high-profile partnerships and central bank integration for long-term growth. While the crypto market is difficult to predict, the outlook remains positive for XRP, with $3.20 representing a realistic short-term target under current market conditions.

2025-06-01T06:05:22,"Missed Bitcoin at $1? Bitcoin Solaris at $5 Is the Closest You’ll Get to a Real Second Shot","The post Missed Bitcoin at $1? Bitcoin Solaris at $5 Is the Closest You’ll Get to a Real Second Shot appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Most investors who passed on Bitcoin early didn’t lack belief — they lacked access, context, or timing. The mechanics were there, but the interface was limited, and the broader market hadn’t caught up. Bitcoin Solaris reintroduces that structure with clearer terms: a locked 21 million supply, no inflation mechanics, and real entry points that don’t rely on speculation or hardware. Phase 5 of the BTC-S presale ends today. The token is priced at 5 USDT, with a supply model that mirrors Bitcoin’s original fixed-cap approach — but deployed on modern infrastructure designed to support mobile mining and rapid scaling from day one. A Supply Model That Doesn’t Move Bitcoin Solaris is permanently capped at 21 million tokens, all hard-coded and locked from future inflation. Of that, 4.2 million were allocated for the entire presale, with all phases published and traceable. No stealth wallets, no emissions model, and no post-launch minting built into the contract. The economics are static — and that’s intentional. With most new chains relying on flexible supply to game rewards or subsidize hype, Bitcoin Solaris is taking the opposite approach. Its value mechanics are front-loaded and locked in — so early access doesn’t just mean lower cost, it means better structural positioning in a closed system. Helios Architecture: The Tech Behind BTC-S Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t run on borrowed infrastructure. It’s built on Helios, a dual-layer blockchain system engineered to scale without the bottlenecks seen in other high-performance chains. At its core is a combination of Proof-of-Stake (PoS)and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), creating a secure and energy-light base for consensus. That foundation is extended by the Solaris Layer — a high-speed validation layer powered by Proof-of-History (PoH)and Proof-of-Time (PoT). This structure enables finality in under two seconds and over 10,000 transactions per second, all while consuming less than 0.05% of the energy used by Bitcoin’s legacy mining system. It’s more than a technical win. It’s what makes mobile mining viable. This system doesn’t rely on hash power — it validates based on committed storage and time. That’s why the Nova App, currently in final pre-launch testing, is able to deliver mining access from standard smartphones with no specialized hardware. Over 11,000 users are already registered for Nova, lining up to enter a network where rewards are tied to action, not asset holding. This is what early Bitcoin looked like — real distribution, real use, and no middleman standing between you and the protocol. Presale Phase 5 Ends Today — So Does This Price At 5 USDT, BTC-S sits far below its projected listing target of 20 USDT. That pricing model isn’t arbitrary — it’s based on liquidity provisioning targets, CEX partner estimates, and the anticipated impact of mobile onboarding at scale. Once listings go live, the entire dynamic shifts. Token acquisition becomes price-driven, and mining returns become more competitive. This phase is the last time entry happens under capped, predictable conditions. The network is about to shift into full operation. Access won’t vanish — but it will get more expensive, and more crowded. BTC-S isn’t being ignored. Several independent analysts have already broken down the structure, architecture, and rollout mechanics — not from hype, but from a technical lens. In a recent breakdown, Crypto Volt walked through Bitcoin Solaris’s consensus model, mobile mining design, and presale economics, calling it “the closest thing to early Bitcoin access since 2013.” Audited, Verified, and Fully Accountable The Bitcoin Solaris ecosystem has passed two full audits. A Cyberscope review confirmed the contract integrity and presale mechanics. A Freshcoins audit tested the Nova App’s mining logic, validating its ability to operate across mobile environments. On top of that, the team has completed KYC verification , giving the project accountability that most presales avoid. These aren’t extras. They’re part of the foundation — and they’re why capital is flowing into BTC-S before it hits open markets. Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t recreate 2011. It builds on what we’ve learned since. Scarcity still drives value. Functionality still beats promises. And timing still matters more than belief. Today is the last day to access BTC-S at 5 USDT. Tomorrow, the protocol continues. The price moves. The curve steepens. What you do now is the part you control.

2025-06-01T06:02:25,"Bitcoin price prediction for June: Will BTC rise or fall in June?","Bitcoin price performed strongly in May, jumping to a record high of $111,900. At its highest point, it was up by over 50% from its lowest point in April, when Donald Trump unveiled his retaliatory tariffs. This BTC forecast looks at what to expect in June. Bitcoin recap for May May was a good month for Bitcoin in a few areas. First, Wall Street investors continued to pump money into BTC during the month. The net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs jumped by over $5.2 billion, while the total value traded during the month jumped to over $73 billion. May was Bitcoin’s best month since January, when the net inflows jumped by $5.25 billion. The surge in inflows brought the cumulative inflows to over $45 billion, making Bitcoin the most successful ETF launches ever. For example, the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) now has over $70 billion in assets under management, 18 months after its launch. In contrast, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) has less than $100 billion in assets, 21 years since its launch. The other big theme in May was the continued Bitcoin purchases by companies, a move that could accelerate following Strategy’s purchases. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, acquired thousands of coins, bringing its total holdings to over 580,235. Twenty One, a company formed between Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether, and Softbank , is acquiring Bitcoins worth over $3 billion. It plans to go public as a Bitcoin holding company. Trump Media, the parent company of TruthSocial, raised $2.5 billion to acquire Bitcoin. GameStop, the game store company, also started to accumulate Bitcoin as we recommended a few months ago. The other big Bitcoin news in May was key events like Consensus Toronto and Token2049 in Dubai. BTC price analysis for June Bitcoin’s price will likely continue doing well in June because of the soaring demand and falling supply. The supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has continued falling, moving from over 3.1 million in 2020 to 1.2 million today. More companies will likely continue acquiring Bitcoins this month, which will help boost its price. The risk, however, is that June is usually one of the worst months for Bitcoin because of the start of the summer season. The average Bitcoin return in June is usually minus 0.50%. The other risk is that the trade war between the US and other countries will continue, leading to more volatility. Also, the Federal Reserve may insist that it will not cut rates soon as inflation remains stubbornly high. Bitcoin price analysis BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Technicals suggest that the BTC price has more upside to go this month as it has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the ongoing retreat being part of the handle section. This cup has a depth of about 32%, meaning that the target price is about $143,000. Bitcoin remains above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Therefore, the most likely scenario is where BTC price rises and hits at least $120,000 this month. A drop below the support at $100,000 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-06-01T05:45:00,"In 60 days, MUTM gained more wallets than PEPE did in its first 3 months","Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has achieved a remarkable milestone by gaining more wallets in just 60 days than Pepe (PEPE) managed during its first three months. While PEPE’s rise was largely driven by hype and speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s rapid growth comes from solid development and genuine utility. This milestone clearly shows that MUTM is more than just a fleeting trend — it is building real traction with lasting potential. Why wallet growth matters Wallet growth is one of the most reliable early indicators of a project’s adoption and future success. Unlike meme tokens that often experience short bursts of hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting users because it offers real value through its decentralized lending and borrowing platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique combination of peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) lending models sets it apart. The P2P model allows users to lend and borrow tokens that are usually unavailable on P2C platforms e.g memecoins like PEPE and DOGE, increasing flexibility and choice. In the P2C model, users pool their assets together, and interest rates adjust automatically based on supply and demand. This dynamic system ensures efficient capital allocation and attractive returns for lenders. Strong passive income potential One of the biggest draws of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its passive income opportunity. Depositing cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), or stablecoins such as DAI into Mutuum’s liquidity pools lets users earn interest that grows as borrowing demand increases. Interest rates fluctuate based on pool utilization, rewarding lenders during periods of high demand with attractive yields. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at the current price of $0.03 could grow 15 to 35 times in value, turning into $15,000 to $35,000. This price appreciation is combined with ongoing passive income from interest and dividends. MUTM token holders who stake their mtTokens also receive rewards funded by protocol revenue buybacks, enhancing long-term earnings. Phase 1 to phase 5: proven growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) started its presale at $0.01 per token during Phase 1. The price has already tripled to $0.03 in Phase 5, reflecting a 200% increase and rewarding early investors handsomely. So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has generated approximately $9.70 million in liquidity with over 11,650 active holders. These figures show strong market interest and support the case for continued growth. According to the project roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a beta version of its platform alongside the live token release. This upcoming beta will allow users to experience the lending and borrowing system firsthand, further driving adoption and engagement. Additionally, ongoing initiatives like the $100,000 giveaway and the recent CertiK audit reinforce the project’s commitment to security and community trust. The CertiK audit completed in May 2025 involved manual review and static analysis, resulting in a solid Token Scan score of 70. This independent verification assures users that Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts are secure and reliable. In an industry where trust is paramount, this audit adds a crucial layer of confidence for both investors and users. Utility that drives sustainable demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s value goes beyond price speculation. Its lending and borrowing system addresses real user needs, such as accessing liquidity without selling assets. Users can deposit ETH or DAI as collateral to borrow other tokens, maintaining exposure to their original holdings while gaining liquidity for new opportunities. This approach helps avoid taxable events and supports more sophisticated trading and investment strategies. Pepe (PEPE) experienced explosive growth fueled mainly by social media hype and community memes. Although it attracted many holders quickly, its utility and long-term value remain limited. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s wallet growth reflects genuine interest fueled by its platform’s functionality, making its trajectory more sustainable and less volatile. While PEPE’s momentum has plateaued, MUTM is still in the early stages of value accumulation with strong foundations. Why now is the best time to invest The difference between Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Phase 1 price of $0.01 and the current Phase 5 price of $0.03 shows how much value has been created so far. But the greatest profit opportunities remain ahead, as later phases will likely offer smaller gains. Early investors who jump in now not only benefit from price appreciation but also start earning passive income immediately. With more than 11,650 holders and nearly $9.70 million generated in liquidity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that this is a once-in-a-cycle opportunity to build generational wealth. The combination of price upside, passive dividends, and expanding platform utility means MUTM tokens are a must-have for serious DeFi participants.

According to the blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, the funds were sent to Ulbricht’s donation wallet just a few hours ago. Crypto community fuels Ulbricht’s fresh start with millions in donations The generous donation is another line of donations Ulbricht has seen since being released. Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange , donated $111,111 in Bitcoin earlier this year to help him adjust to life outside prison. Free Ross also claims to have received over $270,000 in cryptocurrency donations to help Ulbricht prepare for life after prison. Another address associated with Ulbricht collected $4,615 in Ethereum, USDC, Tether (USDT), and Binance Coin (BNB) in the same period. On January 21, 2025, Donald Trump signed a full and unconditional pardon for Silk Road dissenter and operator after 11 years of a double life sentence without parole. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 in New York in a narcotics and money-laundering conspiracy and sentenced to life in prison. Despite his release, questions have been raised as to the financial status of Ulbricht, as reports indicate he could hold access to inactive Bitcoin wallets associated with Silk Road, believed to contain approximately $47m. Ulbricht has been in the news recently after attending the Bitcoin 2025 conference, where he thanked his staunch supporters for coming to his aid while behind bars. He stressed the need for solidarity in the crypto community, saying, “You didn’t leave me. You didn’t forget me. You wrote me letters. You raised money for my defense.” Ulbricht sells some personal items to eliminate the reminders about his arrest The founder of the infamous Silk Road darknet marketplace has also raised approximately $1.8 million in Bitcoin through an auction of personal items and artwork created during his incarceration. The auction, hosted on the Bitcoin-powered collectibles platform Scarce City, featured 13 artifacts from Ulbricht’s life before and during his imprisonment. Among the items auctioned were Ulbricht’s prison ID card, which fetched the highest bid, and an oil painting. Other notable pieces included his prison sneakers, sweatsuit, t-shirt, prison notebook, locker lock, and three ID cards. Additionally, personal items from his life prior to arrest, such as a down sleeping bag, djembe drum, backpack, and a pair of Vibram FiveFingers shoes, were also sold. “I’ve left Arizona, the state where I was in prison. It’s time to travel. That means downsizing and turning the page,” Ulbricht wrote in a message on the auction page . He continued to say that he decided to auction some personal items from before his arrest and during his time in prison. He emphasized that he didn’t need the reminders and noted that some of his supporters would fancy them. Ulbricht’s last prison ID card featuring the early Bitcoin devotee’s broad smile is fetching a winning bid of 11 BTC, now valued at more than $1.1 million. Concerning the broad smile on the ID card, he revealed on the item’s page that Ulbricht still smiled that day despite the guard’s effort to make him stop smiling for the photo. He says his joy comes from within, even though he was in prison. The painting created by Ulbricht and “Omega,” the inmate who taught him oil painting, was another item for auction. Based on reports from sources, the painting took in a high bid of 1.01 BTC. A painting entitled Archway by Ross Ulbricht and another prisoner known as Omega The bidders are set to complete their payment by Monday because the bids are due on June 2. About the painting, Ulbricht said that he was so impressed by how the archway looked in a photo that he had to paint it. He expressed the feeling behind those paintings. According to Ulbricht, the painting made him feel as if he was walking through the archway, as if something amazing was waiting on the other side.

2025-06-01T04:51:50,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is BTC Out of the Woods After 8% Correction?","Bitcoin has faced notable selling pressure at the $111K range, leading to a bearish rejection. Nevertheless, the price lacks sufficient bullish momentum and a deeper correction seems plausible in the mid-term. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Following its breakout above the previous all-time high at $109K and printing a new peak at $111K, Bitcoin met strong resistance that has sparked notable selling pressure. The failure to sustain momentum above this key psychological level has resulted in a bearish rejection, pushing the asset back below the $109K threshold. This price action coincided with the sweep of buy-side liquidity resting above the previous swing high, allowing smart money to execute sell orders efficiently. As a result, the market has entered a corrective phase, now approaching the daily fair value gap (FVG) between $97K and $100K. This zone likely holds substantial demand, potentially acting as a support zone that could trigger a bullish reaction. Should the price stabilize within this FVG, a rebound toward the $111K resistance becomes likely. Conversely, failure to hold this level could pave the way for further downside, with the next key support residing near the $95K region. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, intensified selling pressure at the $111K resistance has caused BTC to break below its previously maintained ascending price channel. The subsequent pullback toward the broken channel boundary near $108K has confirmed the bearish breakout and suggests weakening momentum. Currently, the price is consolidating within a critical support-resistance band spanning from $100K to $108K. As long as Bitcoin remains within this range, short-term volatility is expected. However, a decisive breakout, either above $108K or below $100K, will likely set the tone for the next significant move, with either a bullish recovery or an extended correction unfolding based on the breakout direction. On-chain Analysis The Realized Price of mid-term holders has consistently functioned as a pivotal support or resistance zone, making it a valuable indicator for gauging broader market sentiment. This metric, representing the average on-chain acquisition cost of UTXOs held by long-term investors, often aligns with key turning points in Bitcoin’s price cycle. Currently, Bitcoin remains positioned above the Realized Price of the 3–6 month holder cohort, a signal that this group remains in profit and has not faced significant stress. However, recent selling pressure and a rejection from the $111K level have dragged the price closer to the Realized Price of the 3–6 month holder range, which resides around the $98K zone. This places the $98K–$100K area in the spotlight as a crucial support region. A firm reaction from this zone would confirm continued confidence from mid-term holders and may act as the launchpad for a renewed bullish leg, potentially propelling Bitcoin to fresh all-time highs. Failure to hold this support, however, could shift market sentiment and open the door to deeper corrections.

All eyes are now on a crucial support level around $0.60. The big question — will Pi manage to hold this line, or are we about to see a sharper correction if it slips below this mark? Current Status of Pi Coin Launched in 2019, Pi Coin is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency that allows mining via smartphones, making it widely accessible. After years of anticipation, it was finally listed on exchanges in February 2025. Although initial expectations suggested a listing price of $50, the coin launched at around $3, only to fall to nearly $0.60 — a sharp 78% drop from its peak. Despite this, Pi Coin still commands attention due to its unique mobile-first mining model and a massive user base of over 35 million. Pi has been struggling to break past resistance levels near $0.79, while buyers are showing signs of hesitation at lower levels. Key indicators like the RSI, MACD, and Stochastic RSI reflect weakening momentum, with most metrics leaning bearish. Additionally, a descending wedge pattern has formed since mid-May, yet the price remains trapped inside it. Pi Network Price Prediction For Year End According to CoinDCX, Pi Network is expected to start November 2025 on a bullish note, reclaiming the $2.00 mark and potentially rising to around $2.38 to $2.40 by month’s end. In December, the bullish momentum may strengthen, pushing the price to $2.75 to $2.80. Challenges Facing Pi Coin Mainnet Still Pending : Despite its listing, Pi Network’s full mainnet has not been launched. This raises doubts about its real-world capabilities and long-term viability. Limited Exchange Listings : Pi Coin is available on very few exchanges, restricting access and limiting trading volume. Regulatory Uncertainty : Like many cryptocurrencies, Pi Coin faces regulatory hurdles, adding to investor caution. Overhyped Comparisons to Bitcoin : Although some claim Pi Coin could reach $1,000 or more, such projections seem far-fetched. At that price, its market cap would exceed $6 trillion — compared to its current estimated valuation of just $500 million.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-2025-year-end-price-prediction/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Following the re-start of the crypto bull market in April, Bitcoin has shown a specific price pattern marked by an estimated $10,000 price surge followed by a consolidation within a specific price range for about 7-10 days before another rally occurs. After its most recent ascent to $111,970 as a new ATH, BTC prices appeared to have settled in range bound movement between $106,000-$112,000 in preparation for another potential upswing. However, recent negative market reaction to factors including macro-economic pressure as reports suggest US-China trade talks have hit a wall have forced prices below the consolidation zone to trade as low as $103,867. According to Daan Crypto in an X post on May 30, Bitcoin bulls must reclaim the price range above $106,000 to halt the current decline and establish intentions to maintain the present uptrend. Notably, a potential rejection at this price level would indicate that Bitcoin might have hit a market top at $111,970 and is due for a further price correction over the incoming weeks. The potential of this bearish development is significantly high especially considering other factors including that the Bitcoin spot ETFs registered a negative net inflow on May 29, marking the first time in over ten trading days. Certain market analysts have opined on the potential of an overwhelming bearish pressure pinpointing price targets around $100,000-$102,000, while others believe the premier cryptocurrency could set for a major price crash in alignment with the crypto market cycle. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $103,539 reflecting a loss of 2.60% in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 2.24% indicating a slight fall in selling pressure in the market amidst the current decline. According to data from blockchain analytics firm Sentora , over 1.27 million are presently in a decline due to Bitcoin’s retracement. However, there is strong evidence to back a market rebound should prices retest the $100,000 region.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reclaim-106000-to-avoid-further-crash/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin price prediction|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Daan Crypto|Sentora",cryptocompare

2025-06-01T03:36:34,"Bitcoin Price Retreat Sparks Talk of ‘Deeper Correction’ as Bulls Pause","Bitcoin has pulled back sharply, sparking renewed caution from analysts who warn that the digital asset may be headed for a deeper correction before resuming its bullish trajectory. BTC/USD fell by 8% as of May 31, retreating to levels below its previous all-time high. This decline leaves the token nearly $9,000 below its recent record peak, putting short-term sentiment to the test. Demand Metrics Signal a Cooling Trend A report from CryptoQuant shared with Cointelegraph suggests that Bitcoin’s demand growth may be hitting a temporary ceiling. The analytics platform estimates that Bitcoin demand has increased by 229,000 BTC in the last 30 days, nearing the 279,000 BTC peak seen in December 2024. “Some of Bitcoin’s demand metrics may be reaching a short-term top, which could imply a pause in the current rally,” the report stated. It also noted that whale balances have risen by 2.8% over the past month, a pattern often followed by reduced accumulation from major holders. Additionally, average unrealized profits hovered around 30% when prices neared $111,000—another sign of an imminent slowdown. Analysts Eye Key Technical Levels Prominent trader Mags highlighted the importance of the upcoming weekly candle close. “On the daily chart, BTC has broken below the previous all-time high and is facing rejection at that same level,” Mags observed. “This might look like the start of a deeper correction.” If Bitcoin closes the week below the December 2024 high of $104,450, it may form a bearish pattern before climbing again, he added. Bull Market Outlook Remains Intact for Now Despite the current retreat, broader sentiment remains optimistic. Trader Aksel Kibar said the bull market structure is still intact, provided prices remain above $73,700. He reiterated his 2025 target of $137,000 for BTC, aligning with a midterm bullish outlook. CryptoQuant analysts see $120,000 as a key level where many investors might choose to lock in profits. While the path forward could involve further short-term losses, most analysts agree the bull market has not been derailed.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-price-retreat-sparks-talk-of-deeper-correction-as-bulls-pause/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

2025-06-01T01:00:35,"Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News","Although the past 24 hours have been characterized by heavy selloffs, Bitcoin is still currently holding above the $100,000 level, trading around $103,700 as of the time of writing. Notably, signs of exhaustion are also beginning to surface for Bitcoin, especially in the past 48 hours. While long-term indicators suggest a bullish continuation for the Bitcoin price, short-term models indicate a breakdown of bullish strength, particularly as the cryptocurrency approaches the critical $100,000 support zone. Related Reading: $10 Million Fix? SUI Network Moves Fast After Cetus Exploit Scare This sentiment is relayed by popular crypto analyst Willy Woo, who shared the good and bad news based on Bitcoin’s current technicals. Good News: A Bullish Long-Term Signal Still Intact According to Woo, one of the strongest long-term signals, the Bitcoin Risk Signal, is currently trending downwards. This drop indicates that buy-side liquidity is currently dominant in the long-term environment, setting the stage for another strong leg upward. The lower the risk reading, the safer it is to hold or accumulate Bitcoin, and this signal’s current decline shows a relatively low-risk environment for long-term investors. Woo noted that this long-term setup is intact, and with Bitcoin trading well above the psychological six-figure mark, the momentum is still in favor of the bulls in the long term. At the time of writing, the local risk model, as shown in the chart below, is currently in the mid-range, having declined from peak levels in early 2025, and is expected to continue trending downwards. In another analysis, Willy Woo noted the next significant move could push it above $114,000 and trigger liquidations of short positions. Bad News For Bitcoin Price Although the long-term picture is still favorable, the short-term models, including the Speculation and SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) metrics, are flashing caution. Using this indicator, Woo noted that the strength of the rally from $75,000 to $112,000 has started to weaken, especially with flat capital inflow in the past three days. Keeping this in mind, Bitcoin’s price action this week is critical. “If we do not get follow through, then we will be up for another consolidation period,” the analyst said. If spot buying fails to pick up strongly in the coming week, which is the first week of June, especially with U.S. markets reopening after a long weekend, there will be a chance for a bearish pivot. The good and bad news can be summed up as follows: if buying pressure opens up quickly, Bitcoin could break above $114,000 and head toward the next major liquidity zone between $118,000 and $120,000. Failure to push higher could confirm bearish divergences and set the stage for another round of consolidation. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin?

CRO is the native asset of the Cronos layer-1 blockchain, which was developed by the exchange Crypto.com. Canary filed an S-1 Form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), proposing an ETF that would offer investors exposure to CRO. If approved, the product would also stake a portion of its CRO holdings to earn rewards. The new S-1 statement represents the latest in a spree of recent ETF filings for Canary, which is also attempting to launch Solana ( SOL ), XRP , Sui ( SUI ), Litecoin ( LTC ), Axelar ( AXL ), Hedera ( HBAR ) and Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) funds. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs for trading last July. Two financial firms, Franklin Templeton and Hashdex, also launched joint BTC-ETH ETFs earlier this year. CRO is trading at $0.102 at time of writing and is up more than 8% in the past 24 hours. By comparison, the overall crypto market cap slumped by more than 4% over the same period.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-05-31T22:00:53,"Pepe Makes It To Trump’s Feed—Is A Crypto Endorsement Next?","US President Donald Trump’s brief post on Truth Social on May 29 sparked a quick burst of excitement among crypto traders. Based on reports, some users saw a hidden reference to the Pepe meme coin (PEPE). Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ In the next few hours, PEPE shot up by 5% but then fell back by 15%. Traders are now watching to see if this social push can do what Elon Musk once did for Dogecoin. Pepe Price Moves According to market data, PEPE’s price hit its upper resistance after the Trump post. A short surge brought a 5% gain. Then profit-taking and wider market pressure drove an 18% correction. The flip in momentum shows how fast things can change in meme-coin land. A small tweet or post can send prices soaring, but it only takes a bit of selling to push them down again. 🚨 Wait, what Trump just dropped a $PEPE pic on Truth Social 🚨 Is this a secret crypto endorsement or just trolling the internet? Either way the $PEPE rocket might just have a new co-pilot. What’s next a $PEPE rally or a Twitter melt down Stay tuned👀 pic.twitter.com/cu8RF7D55b — Josh Mair (@WizzOfCrypto) May 29, 2025 On Drama & Speculation Trump’s message saying he’s “on a mission from God” makes him sound like he has a special purpose, not just a political goal. The dark street scene and the words “nothing can stop what is coming” hint that something big is coming, even if he doesn’t explain it. This kind of talk can fire up his most loyal supporters – especially PEPE aficionados – because it feels dramatic and urgent. Chart Patterns In Focus Based on reports from chart watchers, PEPE appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern that began about five months ago. If the coin breaks above the handle, some say it could reach $0.000026—double its current level. Right now, the MACD line sits below the signal line after a recent death cross, hinting at a near-term downtrend. The RSI has dipped toward 52 and may cross below it soon, which could keep sellers in control. The 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level sits at $0.00001 and could act as a bounce point. If that level gives way, traders will look at $0.000008 as the next support. Tariff Ruling Adds Pressure Based on US Court of International Trade filings, the court reversed Trump’s tariff suspensions right around the same time that PEPE spiked. That move seems to have dampened the market’s risk-on mood. For many traders, broader trade news can be a bigger factor than any single tweet. If traders worry about tariffs and slower growth, they often sell off riskier assets like meme coins. That mix of social hype and market worry helped push PEPE down after its brief rally. Looking Ahead For Traders Based on this mix of social buzz and chart signals, it’ll take more than a hint in a post to keep PEPE climbing. If the coin can break above its current resistance by mid-June, $0.000026 seems to be the main target. But a falling MACD and RSI point toward more selling pressure first. Traders should watch the 0.618 level at $0.00001 for signs of a bounce. If that level breaks, they’ll likely aim for $0.000008 next.

Sellers are now aiming for a push below immediate Fib levels; however, buyers are strongly defending further declines.

Manta price chart The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and currently hovers around 42, showing that bears are controlling momentum of the price. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. Manta/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA lines The 4-hour Manta price chart suggests MANTA continues to face bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. However, buyers aim for a surge by sending the price above the EMA20 trend line. MANTA price chart The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.78, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost an upward correction. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening bearish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.256, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.327. MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.196, resulting in a correction to $0.16. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price down today? Manta price has triggered a strong bearish rally toward $0.22. This occurred after buyers failed to maintain the buying pressure around local tops. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday, describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time. MANTA price prediction May 2025 If the altcoin market witnesses a surge in buying pressure this month, we might see a rebound in the MANTA price. In May, we expect Manta’s price to record a minimum of $0.17 and a maximum of $0.37. The average price is expected to be around $0.25.

2025-05-31T21:06:19,"Czech justice minister steps down over $45M BTC gift from darknet ex-convict","Czech Republic Minister of Justice Pavel Blažek has resigned after reports emerged that the Justice Ministry collected Bitcoin donations from an ex-convict. The ministry announced the donations, stating that they had sold the BTC. According to reports , the ministry had accepted a donation of 480 Bitcoins worth around 1 billion Czech Koruna (over $45 million) from Tomáš Jiřikovský, who previously served four years in prison. Jiřikovský was convicted for operating the darknet platform Sheep Marketplace, where users bought drugs and other illegal items. However, the platform stopped operating in 2013, which many considered an exit scam, as the operators disappeared with users’ money. It was not until 2016 that Jiřikovský would be arrested for the incident with a wallet containing over 1,500 Bitcoins found on his computer, according to authorities. He was eventually sentenced to prison for drug trafficking and embezzlement. Blažek’s decision to accept the donation despite the donor’s checkered history has landed him in hot water. Opposition parties have been especially critical of his actions, with speculations of money laundering since he did not know the origin of the funds. The bad press surrounding the incident appeared to be the major factor in the minister’s resignation. Although he has continued denying any wrongdoing, he said he resigned to prevent a negative impact on Prime Minister Peter Fiala’s coalition government. Interestingly, Blažek is a close ally of Fiala, with the two belonging to the same Civic Democratic Party. With the parliamentary election set to happen in October, there are concerns that the incident could further worsen the chances of the incumbent government , which many have already predicted would lose the election. Blažek defends Bitcoin donations Despite his decision to resign, Blažek has defended the ministry’s acceptance of the funds, noting that it was fully legal and would go towards improving the justice system. He highlighted several ways the ministry would use donations, including digitizing the justice system, improving housing conditions for prison staff, and helping fight drugs. According to him, Jiřikovský likely donated the funds to show remorse. He is reported to have said: “Why should a convicted person not be allowed to give something to the state, for example, as a form of penance?” Unsurprisingly, Prime Minister Fiala said that he believed the Justice Minister had acted in good faith and praised his decision to resign. However, many suggest there might be more to the donation than Blažek claims. According to reports , Jiřikovský has been trying to recover the Bitcoins the government seized from him upon his arrest. Although he claimed that he had obtained them legally, which entitles him to keep them, investigations at the time suggested they might be connected to another darknet marketplace, Nucleus. Nucleus shut down the day Jiřikovský was arrested. Czech authorities are investigating the donation Interestingly, Jiřikovský’s lawyer had reached out to Blažek to negotiate the return of the seized assets with an agreement that one-third of the funds would be donated to the ministry. The minister reportedly agreed. This eventually led to the signing of an agreement and the movement of Bitcoin, which was connected to Nucleus, to another wallet in March after being dormant for almost 10 years. While Blažek insisted that he had no interest in the case, which happened long ago, the circumstances around the incident continue to raise eyebrows. Meanwhile, Czech legal authorities are investigating the Bitcoin donation to determine the source of the funds. Given Jiřikovský’s past, there are concerns that the funds might be part of money laundering from criminal activity. According to reports , the National Headquarters for Combating Organization is investigating the incident, while the Public Prosecutor Office for Olomouc is separately probing whether the minister, as a public official, exceeded his powers.

Altcoin bulls faced $1 billion in long liquidations due to overleveraged positions. Bitcoin is seen as an institutional asset, altcoins are still viewed as speculative..

This announcement follows the country’s establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, alongside other partnerships, in recent months. Pakistan’s pro-crypto stance has left the community elated, being among the countries to make a swift turn backing the market. IMF Wants Clarity: Report According to local news outlets, the IMF flagged Pakistan’s recent announcement by its pro-crypto task force to allocate 2000 megawatts of electricity to Bitcoin and AI data centers. The organization seeks clarity on its legality as major power shortages plague the country. This development comes amid sensitive budget talks between both parties as Pakistan looks to integrate digital assets into its economy. According to sources familiar with the matter, the government is yet to disclose a formal framework to the IMF, while the latter stressed that all policy steps under the External Fund Facility must be considered. Additionally, a delegation is expected to hold a separate session on the plan to provide electricity to Bitcoin and AI centres. “ There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative. The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the ongoing talks,” a source added. On May 25, Pakistan’s crypto task force allocated 2,000 megawatts of electricity to Bitcoin mining, seeking to attract foreign investment. Backed by the Finance Ministry, the move is expected to drive employment and generate revenue following massive global adoption of the asset class. The government also plans tax cuts and incentives for miners and AI firms. Bilal Bin Saqib, Task Force Chief Executive, explained that the decision was a turning point for the country’s economy. Pakistan’s Pro-Crypto Stance This year, Pakistan has become increasingly bullish on Bitcoin, contrary to its previous policies on the asset class. The country rolled out a Digital Asset Authority tasked with tokenizing government assets and licensing crypto platforms. Notably, the crypto task force launch and appointment of Changpeng Zhao as an adviser drew institutional attention. At the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, Saqib announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve inspired by the United States’ decision. So far, President Trump remains committed to his promise of clear and favourable policies to the sector. For most commentators, it is the driving force behind massive institutional adoption.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/imf-raises-red-flags-over-pakistans-bitcoin-mining-ai-energy-plan/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|IMF",cryptocompare
