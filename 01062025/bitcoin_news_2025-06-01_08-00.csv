2025-06-01T05:30:53,"Ethereum Climbs In Key Channel After Triple Consolidation Setup","Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction as it climbs within a well-structured ascending channel, following three distinct consolidation phases. These pauses in momentum have served as healthy resets, allowing bulls to regain strength and build a solid base . With price action now trending upward in a controlled manner, ETH appears poised for a sustained rally, provided it maintains support along the channel’s lower boundary and breaks above near-term resistance. Key Channel Unfolds As Ethereum Maintains Its Trajectory HolderStat’s post on X reveals a compelling setup on the Ethereum chart, where the price action is inching closer to a significant resistance zone around $3,100, a level typically associated with profit-taking and potential reversal pressure. This area has been marked as a sell zone, and its alignment with the upper boundary of a technical resistance band makes it a critical battleground for bulls and bears alike. However, the broader structure of the chart leans bullish. Ethereum is printing successive higher lows, a signal of upward momentum and strong buying interest on dips. The presence of breakout arrows is a visual cue used in HolderStat’s analyses to highlight key inflection points and further strengthen the narrative of an upcoming test of this ceiling. On the 2-hour chart, Ethereum’s price action is currently coiling within a well-defined ascending triangle pattern, a formation that signals a bullish continuation. According to Logan Issac Borowu, ETH is holding firmly above the lower boundary, suggesting that buyers are actively defending the trendline and maintaining pressure on the resistance overhead. The key level in focus now is $2,720, which marks the horizontal ceiling of the triangle. This level has rejected multiple breakout attempts, acting as a lid on Ethereum’s short-term upside. As the price continues to form higher lows against this resistance, bullish momentum is building. A move above $2,720 could confirm the breakout and open the door for a move toward higher levels. The next technical target , based on the height of the triangle, is the $3,200 level, which aligns with the previous supply zone and resistance. RSI Dips Toward Oversold—Bounce Incoming Or Bear Trap? Ethereum’s upward path is not without barriers. Gemxbt has revealed a critical pattern forming on Ethereum’s 1-hour chart, particularly a Descending Triangle formation. ETH is currently compressing between horizontal support near $2,550 and descending resistance around $2,700, creating a tightening range. Despite the possibility of a bounce as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) approaches oversold territory, the short-term momentum remains tilted to the downside. Ethereum is also trading below key moving averages, reinforcing the underlying weakness in trend structure. Unless bulls reclaim the resistance level with conviction , the triangle pattern suggests a potential short-term breakdown, which could push ETH down to lower support zones. Conversely, a bounce from oversold levels could see the altcoin retest the $2,700 zone, which may lead to a shift in market sentiment.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-climbs-in-key-channel/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|ascending triangle|Descending Resistance Line|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|GemXBT|HolderStat|Logan Issac Borowu|relative strength index|RSI",cryptocompare

According to the blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, the funds were sent to Ulbricht’s donation wallet just a few hours ago. Crypto community fuels Ulbricht’s fresh start with millions in donations The generous donation is another line of donations Ulbricht has seen since being released. Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange , donated $111,111 in Bitcoin earlier this year to help him adjust to life outside prison. Free Ross also claims to have received over $270,000 in cryptocurrency donations to help Ulbricht prepare for life after prison. Another address associated with Ulbricht collected $4,615 in Ethereum, USDC, Tether (USDT), and Binance Coin (BNB) in the same period. On January 21, 2025, Donald Trump signed a full and unconditional pardon for Silk Road dissenter and operator after 11 years of a double life sentence without parole. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 in New York in a narcotics and money-laundering conspiracy and sentenced to life in prison. Despite his release, questions have been raised as to the financial status of Ulbricht, as reports indicate he could hold access to inactive Bitcoin wallets associated with Silk Road, believed to contain approximately $47m. Ulbricht has been in the news recently after attending the Bitcoin 2025 conference, where he thanked his staunch supporters for coming to his aid while behind bars. He stressed the need for solidarity in the crypto community, saying, “You didn’t leave me. You didn’t forget me. You wrote me letters. You raised money for my defense.” Ulbricht sells some personal items to eliminate the reminders about his arrest The founder of the infamous Silk Road darknet marketplace has also raised approximately $1.8 million in Bitcoin through an auction of personal items and artwork created during his incarceration. The auction, hosted on the Bitcoin-powered collectibles platform Scarce City, featured 13 artifacts from Ulbricht’s life before and during his imprisonment. Among the items auctioned were Ulbricht’s prison ID card, which fetched the highest bid, and an oil painting. Other notable pieces included his prison sneakers, sweatsuit, t-shirt, prison notebook, locker lock, and three ID cards. Additionally, personal items from his life prior to arrest, such as a down sleeping bag, djembe drum, backpack, and a pair of Vibram FiveFingers shoes, were also sold. “I’ve left Arizona, the state where I was in prison. It’s time to travel. That means downsizing and turning the page,” Ulbricht wrote in a message on the auction page . He continued to say that he decided to auction some personal items from before his arrest and during his time in prison. He emphasized that he didn’t need the reminders and noted that some of his supporters would fancy them. Ulbricht’s last prison ID card featuring the early Bitcoin devotee’s broad smile is fetching a winning bid of 11 BTC, now valued at more than $1.1 million. Concerning the broad smile on the ID card, he revealed on the item’s page that Ulbricht still smiled that day despite the guard’s effort to make him stop smiling for the photo. He says his joy comes from within, even though he was in prison. The painting created by Ulbricht and “Omega,” the inmate who taught him oil painting, was another item for auction. Based on reports from sources, the painting took in a high bid of 1.01 BTC. A painting entitled Archway by Ross Ulbricht and another prisoner known as Omega The bidders are set to complete their payment by Monday because the bids are due on June 2. About the painting, Ulbricht said that he was so impressed by how the archway looked in a photo that he had to paint it. He expressed the feeling behind those paintings. According to Ulbricht, the painting made him feel as if he was walking through the archway, as if something amazing was waiting on the other side.

2025-06-01T04:51:50,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is BTC Out of the Woods After 8% Correction?","Bitcoin has faced notable selling pressure at the $111K range, leading to a bearish rejection. Nevertheless, the price lacks sufficient bullish momentum and a deeper correction seems plausible in the mid-term. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Following its breakout above the previous all-time high at $109K and printing a new peak at $111K, Bitcoin met strong resistance that has sparked notable selling pressure. The failure to sustain momentum above this key psychological level has resulted in a bearish rejection, pushing the asset back below the $109K threshold. This price action coincided with the sweep of buy-side liquidity resting above the previous swing high, allowing smart money to execute sell orders efficiently. As a result, the market has entered a corrective phase, now approaching the daily fair value gap (FVG) between $97K and $100K. This zone likely holds substantial demand, potentially acting as a support zone that could trigger a bullish reaction. Should the price stabilize within this FVG, a rebound toward the $111K resistance becomes likely. Conversely, failure to hold this level could pave the way for further downside, with the next key support residing near the $95K region. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, intensified selling pressure at the $111K resistance has caused BTC to break below its previously maintained ascending price channel. The subsequent pullback toward the broken channel boundary near $108K has confirmed the bearish breakout and suggests weakening momentum. Currently, the price is consolidating within a critical support-resistance band spanning from $100K to $108K. As long as Bitcoin remains within this range, short-term volatility is expected. However, a decisive breakout, either above $108K or below $100K, will likely set the tone for the next significant move, with either a bullish recovery or an extended correction unfolding based on the breakout direction. On-chain Analysis The Realized Price of mid-term holders has consistently functioned as a pivotal support or resistance zone, making it a valuable indicator for gauging broader market sentiment. This metric, representing the average on-chain acquisition cost of UTXOs held by long-term investors, often aligns with key turning points in Bitcoin’s price cycle. Currently, Bitcoin remains positioned above the Realized Price of the 3–6 month holder cohort, a signal that this group remains in profit and has not faced significant stress. However, recent selling pressure and a rejection from the $111K level have dragged the price closer to the Realized Price of the 3–6 month holder range, which resides around the $98K zone. This places the $98K–$100K area in the spotlight as a crucial support region. A firm reaction from this zone would confirm continued confidence from mid-term holders and may act as the launchpad for a renewed bullish leg, potentially propelling Bitcoin to fresh all-time highs. Failure to hold this support, however, could shift market sentiment and open the door to deeper corrections.

All eyes are now on a crucial support level around $0.60. The big question — will Pi manage to hold this line, or are we about to see a sharper correction if it slips below this mark? Current Status of Pi Coin Launched in 2019, Pi Coin is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency that allows mining via smartphones, making it widely accessible. After years of anticipation, it was finally listed on exchanges in February 2025. Although initial expectations suggested a listing price of $50, the coin launched at around $3, only to fall to nearly $0.60 — a sharp 78% drop from its peak. Despite this, Pi Coin still commands attention due to its unique mobile-first mining model and a massive user base of over 35 million. Pi has been struggling to break past resistance levels near $0.79, while buyers are showing signs of hesitation at lower levels. Key indicators like the RSI, MACD, and Stochastic RSI reflect weakening momentum, with most metrics leaning bearish. Additionally, a descending wedge pattern has formed since mid-May, yet the price remains trapped inside it. Pi Network Price Prediction For Year End According to CoinDCX, Pi Network is expected to start November 2025 on a bullish note, reclaiming the $2.00 mark and potentially rising to around $2.38 to $2.40 by month’s end. In December, the bullish momentum may strengthen, pushing the price to $2.75 to $2.80. Challenges Facing Pi Coin Mainnet Still Pending : Despite its listing, Pi Network’s full mainnet has not been launched. This raises doubts about its real-world capabilities and long-term viability. Limited Exchange Listings : Pi Coin is available on very few exchanges, restricting access and limiting trading volume. Regulatory Uncertainty : Like many cryptocurrencies, Pi Coin faces regulatory hurdles, adding to investor caution. Overhyped Comparisons to Bitcoin : Although some claim Pi Coin could reach $1,000 or more, such projections seem far-fetched. At that price, its market cap would exceed $6 trillion — compared to its current estimated valuation of just $500 million.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-2025-year-end-price-prediction/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

2025-06-01T03:36:34,"Bitcoin Price Retreat Sparks Talk of ‘Deeper Correction’ as Bulls Pause","Bitcoin has pulled back sharply, sparking renewed caution from analysts who warn that the digital asset may be headed for a deeper correction before resuming its bullish trajectory. BTC/USD fell by 8% as of May 31, retreating to levels below its previous all-time high. This decline leaves the token nearly $9,000 below its recent record peak, putting short-term sentiment to the test. Demand Metrics Signal a Cooling Trend A report from CryptoQuant shared with Cointelegraph suggests that Bitcoin’s demand growth may be hitting a temporary ceiling. The analytics platform estimates that Bitcoin demand has increased by 229,000 BTC in the last 30 days, nearing the 279,000 BTC peak seen in December 2024. “Some of Bitcoin’s demand metrics may be reaching a short-term top, which could imply a pause in the current rally,” the report stated. It also noted that whale balances have risen by 2.8% over the past month, a pattern often followed by reduced accumulation from major holders. Additionally, average unrealized profits hovered around 30% when prices neared $111,000—another sign of an imminent slowdown. Analysts Eye Key Technical Levels Prominent trader Mags highlighted the importance of the upcoming weekly candle close. “On the daily chart, BTC has broken below the previous all-time high and is facing rejection at that same level,” Mags observed. “This might look like the start of a deeper correction.” If Bitcoin closes the week below the December 2024 high of $104,450, it may form a bearish pattern before climbing again, he added. Bull Market Outlook Remains Intact for Now Despite the current retreat, broader sentiment remains optimistic. Trader Aksel Kibar said the bull market structure is still intact, provided prices remain above $73,700. He reiterated his 2025 target of $137,000 for BTC, aligning with a midterm bullish outlook. CryptoQuant analysts see $120,000 as a key level where many investors might choose to lock in profits. While the path forward could involve further short-term losses, most analysts agree the bull market has not been derailed.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-price-retreat-sparks-talk-of-deeper-correction-as-bulls-pause/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

Notably, signs of exhaustion are also beginning to surface for Bitcoin, especially in the past 48 hours. While long-term indicators suggest a bullish continuation for the Bitcoin price, short-term models indicate a breakdown of bullish strength, particularly as the cryptocurrency approaches the critical $100,000 support zone. Related Reading: $10 Million Fix? SUI Network Moves Fast After Cetus Exploit Scare This sentiment is relayed by popular crypto analyst Willy Woo, who shared the good and bad news based on Bitcoin’s current technicals. Good News: A Bullish Long-Term Signal Still Intact According to Woo, one of the strongest long-term signals, the Bitcoin Risk Signal, is currently trending downwards. This drop indicates that buy-side liquidity is currently dominant in the long-term environment, setting the stage for another strong leg upward. The lower the risk reading, the safer it is to hold or accumulate Bitcoin, and this signal’s current decline shows a relatively low-risk environment for long-term investors. Woo noted that this long-term setup is intact, and with Bitcoin trading well above the psychological six-figure mark, the momentum is still in favor of the bulls in the long term. At the time of writing, the local risk model, as shown in the chart below, is currently in the mid-range, having declined from peak levels in early 2025, and is expected to continue trending downwards. In another analysis, Willy Woo noted the next significant move could push it above $114,000 and trigger liquidations of short positions. Bad News For Bitcoin Price Although the long-term picture is still favorable, the short-term models, including the Speculation and SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) metrics, are flashing caution. Using this indicator, Woo noted that the strength of the rally from $75,000 to $112,000 has started to weaken, especially with flat capital inflow in the past three days. Keeping this in mind, Bitcoin’s price action this week is critical. “If we do not get follow through, then we will be up for another consolidation period,” the analyst said. If spot buying fails to pick up strongly in the coming week, which is the first week of June, especially with U.S. markets reopening after a long weekend, there will be a chance for a bearish pivot. The good and bad news can be summed up as follows: if buying pressure opens up quickly, Bitcoin could break above $114,000 and head toward the next major liquidity zone between $118,000 and $120,000. Failure to push higher could confirm bearish divergences and set the stage for another round of consolidation. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin?

The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs for trading last July. Two financial firms, Franklin Templeton and Hashdex, also launched joint BTC-ETH ETFs earlier this year. CRO is trading at $0.102 at time of writing and is up more than 8% in the past 24 hours. By comparison, the overall crypto market cap slumped by more than 4% over the same period.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T22:00:53,"Pepe Makes It To Trump’s Feed—Is A Crypto Endorsement Next?","US President Donald Trump’s brief post on Truth Social on May 29 sparked a quick burst of excitement among crypto traders. Based on reports, some users saw a hidden reference to the Pepe meme coin (PEPE). Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ In the next few hours, PEPE shot up by 5% but then fell back by 15%. Traders are now watching to see if this social push can do what Elon Musk once did for Dogecoin. Pepe Price Moves According to market data, PEPE’s price hit its upper resistance after the Trump post. A short surge brought a 5% gain. Then profit-taking and wider market pressure drove an 18% correction. The flip in momentum shows how fast things can change in meme-coin land. A small tweet or post can send prices soaring, but it only takes a bit of selling to push them down again. 🚨 Wait, what Trump just dropped a $PEPE pic on Truth Social 🚨 Is this a secret crypto endorsement or just trolling the internet? Either way the $PEPE rocket might just have a new co-pilot. What’s next a $PEPE rally or a Twitter melt down Stay tuned👀 pic.twitter.com/cu8RF7D55b — Josh Mair (@WizzOfCrypto) May 29, 2025 On Drama & Speculation Trump’s message saying he’s “on a mission from God” makes him sound like he has a special purpose, not just a political goal. The dark street scene and the words “nothing can stop what is coming” hint that something big is coming, even if he doesn’t explain it. This kind of talk can fire up his most loyal supporters – especially PEPE aficionados – because it feels dramatic and urgent. Chart Patterns In Focus Based on reports from chart watchers, PEPE appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern that began about five months ago. If the coin breaks above the handle, some say it could reach $0.000026—double its current level. Right now, the MACD line sits below the signal line after a recent death cross, hinting at a near-term downtrend. The RSI has dipped toward 52 and may cross below it soon, which could keep sellers in control. The 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level sits at $0.00001 and could act as a bounce point. If that level gives way, traders will look at $0.000008 as the next support. Tariff Ruling Adds Pressure Based on US Court of International Trade filings, the court reversed Trump’s tariff suspensions right around the same time that PEPE spiked. That move seems to have dampened the market’s risk-on mood. For many traders, broader trade news can be a bigger factor than any single tweet. If traders worry about tariffs and slower growth, they often sell off riskier assets like meme coins. That mix of social hype and market worry helped push PEPE down after its brief rally. Looking Ahead For Traders Based on this mix of social buzz and chart signals, it’ll take more than a hint in a post to keep PEPE climbing. If the coin can break above its current resistance by mid-June, $0.000026 seems to be the main target. But a falling MACD and RSI point toward more selling pressure first. Traders should watch the 0.618 level at $0.00001 for signs of a bounce. If that level breaks, they’ll likely aim for $0.000008 next.

Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future.

2025-05-31T21:06:19,"Czech justice minister steps down over $45M BTC gift from darknet ex-convict","Czech Republic Minister of Justice Pavel Blažek has resigned after reports emerged that the Justice Ministry collected Bitcoin donations from an ex-convict. The ministry announced the donations, stating that they had sold the BTC. According to reports , the ministry had accepted a donation of 480 Bitcoins worth around 1 billion Czech Koruna (over $45 million) from Tomáš Jiřikovský, who previously served four years in prison. Jiřikovský was convicted for operating the darknet platform Sheep Marketplace, where users bought drugs and other illegal items. However, the platform stopped operating in 2013, which many considered an exit scam, as the operators disappeared with users’ money. It was not until 2016 that Jiřikovský would be arrested for the incident with a wallet containing over 1,500 Bitcoins found on his computer, according to authorities. He was eventually sentenced to prison for drug trafficking and embezzlement. Blažek’s decision to accept the donation despite the donor’s checkered history has landed him in hot water. Opposition parties have been especially critical of his actions, with speculations of money laundering since he did not know the origin of the funds. The bad press surrounding the incident appeared to be the major factor in the minister’s resignation. Although he has continued denying any wrongdoing, he said he resigned to prevent a negative impact on Prime Minister Peter Fiala’s coalition government. Interestingly, Blažek is a close ally of Fiala, with the two belonging to the same Civic Democratic Party. With the parliamentary election set to happen in October, there are concerns that the incident could further worsen the chances of the incumbent government , which many have already predicted would lose the election. Blažek defends Bitcoin donations Despite his decision to resign, Blažek has defended the ministry’s acceptance of the funds, noting that it was fully legal and would go towards improving the justice system. He highlighted several ways the ministry would use donations, including digitizing the justice system, improving housing conditions for prison staff, and helping fight drugs. According to him, Jiřikovský likely donated the funds to show remorse. He is reported to have said: “Why should a convicted person not be allowed to give something to the state, for example, as a form of penance?” Unsurprisingly, Prime Minister Fiala said that he believed the Justice Minister had acted in good faith and praised his decision to resign. However, many suggest there might be more to the donation than Blažek claims. According to reports , Jiřikovský has been trying to recover the Bitcoins the government seized from him upon his arrest. Although he claimed that he had obtained them legally, which entitles him to keep them, investigations at the time suggested they might be connected to another darknet marketplace, Nucleus. Nucleus shut down the day Jiřikovský was arrested. Czech authorities are investigating the donation Interestingly, Jiřikovský’s lawyer had reached out to Blažek to negotiate the return of the seized assets with an agreement that one-third of the funds would be donated to the ministry. The minister reportedly agreed. This eventually led to the signing of an agreement and the movement of Bitcoin, which was connected to Nucleus, to another wallet in March after being dormant for almost 10 years. While Blažek insisted that he had no interest in the case, which happened long ago, the circumstances around the incident continue to raise eyebrows. Meanwhile, Czech legal authorities are investigating the Bitcoin donation to determine the source of the funds. Given Jiřikovský’s past, there are concerns that the funds might be part of money laundering from criminal activity. According to reports , the National Headquarters for Combating Organization is investigating the incident, while the Public Prosecutor Office for Olomouc is separately probing whether the minister, as a public official, exceeded his powers.

This announcement follows the country’s establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, alongside other partnerships, in recent months. Pakistan’s pro-crypto stance has left the community elated, being among the countries to make a swift turn backing the market. IMF Wants Clarity: Report According to local news outlets, the IMF flagged Pakistan’s recent announcement by its pro-crypto task force to allocate 2000 megawatts of electricity to Bitcoin and AI data centers. The organization seeks clarity on its legality as major power shortages plague the country. This development comes amid sensitive budget talks between both parties as Pakistan looks to integrate digital assets into its economy. According to sources familiar with the matter, the government is yet to disclose a formal framework to the IMF, while the latter stressed that all policy steps under the External Fund Facility must be considered. Additionally, a delegation is expected to hold a separate session on the plan to provide electricity to Bitcoin and AI centres. “ There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative. The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the ongoing talks,” a source added. On May 25, Pakistan’s crypto task force allocated 2,000 megawatts of electricity to Bitcoin mining, seeking to attract foreign investment. Backed by the Finance Ministry, the move is expected to drive employment and generate revenue following massive global adoption of the asset class. The government also plans tax cuts and incentives for miners and AI firms. Bilal Bin Saqib, Task Force Chief Executive, explained that the decision was a turning point for the country’s economy. Pakistan’s Pro-Crypto Stance This year, Pakistan has become increasingly bullish on Bitcoin, contrary to its previous policies on the asset class. The country rolled out a Digital Asset Authority tasked with tokenizing government assets and licensing crypto platforms. Notably, the crypto task force launch and appointment of Changpeng Zhao as an adviser drew institutional attention. At the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, Saqib announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve inspired by the United States’ decision. So far, President Trump remains committed to his promise of clear and favourable policies to the sector. For most commentators, it is the driving force behind massive institutional adoption.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/imf-raises-red-flags-over-pakistans-bitcoin-mining-ai-energy-plan/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|IMF",cryptocompare

At an event organized by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, Dimon told regulators that the full effect of all the money printed since 2020 remains to be seen. “You are going to see a crack in the bond market. It is going to happen. And I tell this to my regulators, some of you who are in this room, I’m telling you it’s going to happen and you’re going to panic. I’m not gonna panic. We’ll be fine. We’ll probably make more money, and then some of my friends will tell me, ‘We like crises because it’s good for JPMorgan Chase.’ Not really.'” Dimon says bond vigilantes are back, selling bonds to protest unsustainable fiscal policies and America’s ballooning debt. In the long run, Dimon says he’s not too worried about China as a potential adversary, and instead believes the US needs to self improve and erase the “enemy within.” “If we are not the preeminent military and the preeminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency. That’s a fact. Just read history… We we have to get our act together and we have to do it very quickly.” Dimon says a concerted effort to streamline regulations, immigration, taxation, healthcare and schools is needed. He also reiterated his dissatisfaction with Bitcoin’s emergence as a strategic reserve asset. “We shouldn’t be stockpiling Bitcoin.

2025-05-31T19:07:07,"Is Bitcoin’s $103,000 Plunge the Start of a Crypto Meltdown?","According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin’s price slipped to $103,700, a 2% drop over 24 hours. This comes just days after it hit an all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. At the same time, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $616 million in outflows, led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw $430.8 million redeemed, ending its 31-day inflow streak. Is this a healthy market correction or the start of a broader crypto downturn? Bitcoin ETF Outflows Signal Changing Sentiment On May 30, the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw $616.1 million leave their funds according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock’s IBIT alone accounted for $430.8 million—the largest single-day outflow since its January 2024 debut. Just a week earlier, these same ETFs pulled in $2.75 billion for the week ending May 23, a 4.5× increase from the $608 million of the prior week . ETF analyst Nate Geraci noted on X that IBIT has now amassed roughly $70 billion in Bitcoin holdings since launch, calling the recent fund flows “ridiculous.” Kyle Chasse of Master Ventures said the outflows are not driven by retail panic but rather reflect a “quiet transfer of supply to the strongest hands.” Source: X These outflows coincide with Bitcoin’s pullback from its May 22 peak. After surging to $111,970, BTC briefly traded near $108,141 on May 23 before sliding toward $103,700 on May 30. ETF flows and price action appear tightly linked; heavy redemptions placed downward pressure on spot markets, reversing mid-May gains. Bitcoin’s late-May drop also reflects broader macroeconomic factors. On May 30, the total cryptocurrency market cap fell 2.12% to $3.34 trillion. Investors cite renewed geopolitical tensions and U.S. economic concerns as reasons to reduce risk exposure. High Treasury yields and talk of inflationary headwinds have slowed appetite for volatile assets. In traditional markets, the S&P 500 slipped 0.7% on May 22 while Bitcoin hit $111,970, showing a rare decoupling between stocks and crypto. However, equities and crypto felt pressure by the month’s end. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell from 78 (“Extreme Greed”) on May 22 to 66 (“Greed”) by May 30, signaling a slight cooling of investor enthusiasm. Bitcoin has a history of sharp corrections after rapid rallies. After climbing from $60,000 to $69,000 in October 2021, BTC plunged 20% in two days, retracing gains before consolidating. Similarly, following its $69,000 peak in November 2021, BTC fell below $50,000 by January 2022—over a 27% drop. The May 2025 dip to $103,700 marks roughly a 7% pullback from the $111,970 high. That is modest compared to past corrections. Nonetheless, it underscores Bitcoin’s volatility. Analyst Crypto Dan of CryptoQuant pointed out that funding rates remain low relative to previous peaks, suggesting limited leverage-driven excess. What’s Ahead for Bitcoin Price? Traders will watch ETF flows closely in early June. If outflows persist, they may signal waning institutional demand, potentially dragging BTC lower. BTC/USDT Daily Chart| Source: TradingView However, many see the late-May redemptions as a temporary rotation rather than a wholesale exit. As Kyle Chasse noted, supply is shifting to long-term holders, which could support price stability once selling subsidies. Upcoming U.S. macro data—especially the June 13 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report—and any Federal Reserve commentary on interest rates will be crucial. A dovish Fed could buoy risk assets, including Bitcoin. Conversely, hotter-than-expected inflation data might prompt another pullback. On the technical side, traders are eyeing $100,000 as key psychological support. Below that, the next major support zone lies near $94,000, the mid-April low. If BTC holds above $100,000, it may reclaim momentum and attempt new highs. Failure to hold could open the door to a deeper correction. For now, Bitcoin’s $103,700 dip appears more like a correction than a meltdown. Institutional flows have swung rapidly, but large holders seem poised to absorb supply.

2025-05-31T19:00:04,"Can Dogecoin Price Still Rally 1,000%? Analyst Reveals End-Of-Year Prediction","A crypto analyst has forecasted a potential 1,000% rally for the Dogecoin price by the end of the year, suggesting that the leading meme coin could not only reach the coveted $1 milestone but blast past it to $2. While this target may seem bold, especially with Dogecoin still trading below $0.5, the analysis is backed by a compelling combination of historical price behavior, market structure, and accumulation patterns. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ Dogecoin Price Targets $2 By Year’s End According to a 2-day chart analysis published by crypto market expert ‘Setupsfx_‘ on TradingView, Dogecoin has been navigating a textbook accumulation phase reminiscent of previous cycles that preceded explosive price surges. Based on this distinct historical price behavior, the analyst is boldly predicting a major breakout, anticipating a 1,000% rally that could allow the meme coin to smash through $2 by the end of the year. Using the Wyckoff theory as a foundation, the TradingView expert presented a chart illustrating a clear structure of accumulation, distribution, markdown, and markup—- all of which have played out in past market movements. The chart shows that Dogecoin followed a typical Wyckoff accumulation in its early 2021 cycle, where it traded sideways and spent months consolidating in a defined range. This range, indicated by the blue box on the chart, has been highlighted as a key buy zone between roughly $0.12 and $0.16. Notably, this key zone is the final area where the Dogecoin price could be revisited before launching higher. A return to this range would complete the historical price structure and present an ideal entry point before the markup stage begins. Currently, Dogecoin has concluded its markdown phase and is approaching the final stages of accumulation, paving the way for a potential bullish breakout. If price action continues to respect this historically bullish roadmap, Setupsfx_ forecasts that Dogecoin could gradually move higher over the coming months. By late 2025, this could culminate in a full-blown rally to $2, a level that represents approximately 1,000% upside from current prices. While the TradingView analyst maintains a bullish stance on Dogecoin’s outlook, he has tempered expectations, cautioning that the journey to $2 isn’t expected to be linear. Dogecoin could still face volatility, retracement, and psychological resistance around levels like $0.25, $0.5, and $1, which could slow down its climb. A Push Above $3 Still In The Cards Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade on X (formerly Twitter) is even more bullish on Dogecoin’s future price, projecting a potential rally to $3.8. This optimistic forecast is supported by the emergence of a bullish Ascending Broadening Wedge pattern on Dogecoin’s weekly chart. Six key touch points confirm the pattern, labeled A through F, within a widening channel indicated on the price chart. The critical level to watch is the $0.47 resistance level, marked by the previous high around point E. Related Reading: $10 Million Fix? SUI Network Moves Fast After Cetus Exploit Scare A confirmed breakout above this level could validate the wedge and potentially trigger a significant price surge. Based on the measured move from the wedge’s widest point, the analyst highlights a projected path to $3.8, representing a massive 2,011% surge from current prices around $0.18.
