2025-06-01T14:54:45,"AI Trading Bots for Risk-Adjusted Returns in Crypto","While most crypto traders fixate on maximum returns, professional investors focus on risk-adjusted performance—the returns generated relative to the risks taken. Cryptocurrency markets present unique challenges with their extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and 24/7 trading cycles. AI trading systems excel in this environment by maintaining consistent risk parameters regardless of market conditions. A properly configured DeFi trading bot applies mathematical precision to risk management tasks that human traders often compromise during emotional market phases. This article examines how AI trading bots implement sophisticated risk-adjusted strategies and the metrics to evaluate their effectiveness. Risk-Adjusted Returns in Crypto Markets Risk-adjusted returns measure investment performance accounting for the risk assumed to generate those returns. Unlike absolute returns, which only show profits, risk-adjusted metrics provide context for those gains. Key risk-adjusted performance indicators include: Sharpe Ratio: Returns beyond risk-free rate divided by standard deviation of returns Sortino Ratio: Similar to Sharpe but only considers downside deviation Maximum Drawdown: Largest percentage drop from peak to subsequent trough Calmar Ratio: Annual return divided by maximum drawdown Ulcer Index: Measures drawdown pain over time Crypto markets demand specialized risk assessment due to their fat-tailed distribution patterns—extreme events occur more frequently than traditional financial models predict. While HODLing crypto assets has historically produced strong overall returns, the journey includes drawdowns exceeding 85% during bear markets. AI trading strategies typically target more modest returns with significantly reduced drawdowns, resulting in superior risk-adjusted performance. Key Risk Management Capabilities of AI Trading Bots AI trading bots implement programmatic risk management through several core capabilities: Position Sizing Algorithms: Automatically adjust trade size based on volatility metrics, reducing exposure during turbulent markets. Dynamic Stop-Loss Systems: Continuously recalculate optimal stop-loss levels using standard deviation bands, support/resistance levels, or volatility-based approaches. Correlation-Based Hedging: Monitor relationships between assets to prevent overexposure to single risk factors. Drawdown Controls: Implement trading size reductions after losses to preserve capital during drawdowns. Tail Risk Detection: Use machine learning to identify patterns preceding major market dislocations. Volatility-Responsive Trading Strategies Volatility forms the cornerstone of risk-adjusted trading systems. Advanced bots implement: Volatility Bands Trading: Only entering positions when market volatility falls within predetermined ranges, avoiding both extremely quiet markets (insufficient movement) and chaotic conditions (excessive risk). ATR-Based Position Sizing: Using Average True Range to establish position sizes proportional to market noise, reducing allocations when volatility expands. Regime-Switching Models: Implementing different parameter sets for distinct volatility regimes, automatically shifting between aggressive, moderate, and defensive postures. Volatility Trend Analysis: Analyzing directional changes in volatility to predict potential market regime shifts before they fully materialize. AI-Powered Risk Assessment Techniques AI systems continuously evaluate market conditions to adjust risk parameters using: Regime Classification: Machine learning models categorize current market conditions into distinct regimes (trending, ranging, volatile) based on dozens of technical factors. Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised learning algorithms flag unusual market behavior that doesn't match historical patterns, triggering defensive measures. NLP Sentiment Analysis : Monitoring news and social media sentiment to adjust risk exposure when negative sentiment spikes precede potential downturns. Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis: Tracking dynamic relationships between cryptocurrencies, detecting when typically uncorrelated assets move together — a warning sign of systemic risk. Machine Learning Models for Risk Profiling Specific machine learning approaches deliver superior risk assessment: Gaussian Mixture Models: Identify distinct market volatility regimes without requiring labeled data. LSTM Networks: Predict volatility spikes by recognizing temporal patterns in market data sequences. Random Forest Classifiers: Rank feature importance to identify which indicators currently drive market risk. Reinforcement Learning: Discover optimal risk-reward tradeoffs through experience, optimizing for Sharpe ratio rather than absolute returns. Implementing Risk-Adjusted Bot Strategies Practical implementation of risk-adjusted trading bots requires specific configuration approaches: Calibrate risk parameters first, then optimize for returns—not vice versa. Start with maximum drawdown limits, then adjust other parameters to maximize returns within these constraints. Backtest across multiple market regimes with emphasis on stress periods. A strategy should demonstrate resilience during crashes, not just performance during uptrends. Implement gradual capital deployment through dollar-cost averaging into positions rather than taking full-size entries. Employ time-based risk adjustments, reducing position sizes during historically volatile time periods (like weekend markets or around major economic announcements). Configure cross-market hedging to offset directional exposure when correlation between assets increases. Position Sizing and Risk Allocation Position sizing represents the most powerful risk management tool available: Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing: $Position = \frac{Account \times Risk%}{Volatility \times Stop Distance}$ Risk Parity Approach: Allocate capital inverse to asset volatility, giving more stable assets larger allocations. Correlation-Weighted Exposure: Reduce aggregate positions in highly correlated assets to prevent overexposure to single risk factors. Maximum Drawdown Recovery Sizing: Scale position sizes relative to distance from maximum equity peak, reducing exposure after drawdowns. Measuring Bot Performance Through Risk-Adjusted Metrics Evaluate bot performance using risk-adjusted metrics rather than absolute returns: Track monthly Sharpe and Sortino ratios with a target of consistently maintaining values above 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. Compare maximum drawdown percentage against absolute returns. Professional strategies typically target annual returns at least twice their maximum drawdown. Monitor recovery time after drawdowns—the period required to reach new equity highs after losses. Analyze performance variation across market regimes to identify strategy blind spots. Even slight underperformance during certain market phases is acceptable if the strategy demonstrates strong risk-adjusted returns overall. Case Study: AI Bot Performance During Market Stress During the May 2021 crypto crash, when Bitcoin fell 53% from its peak, several AI trading strategies demonstrated superior risk management: Early Reduction of Exposure: Machine learning models detected anomalous market conditions 12-24 hours before the major crash, automatically reducing position sizes. Volatility-Based Position Sizing: Strategies employing volatility-adjusted position sizing automatically reduced trade size as market turbulence increased. Correlation-Based Risk Management: Systems monitoring inter-market correlations detected unusual synchronization across assets and implemented defensive measures. Recovery Positioning: While human traders often remained sidelined after the crash, AI systems methodically re-entered positions at technical support levels, capturing the subsequent recovery. The most successful systems maintained drawdowns below 15% during this period, compared to the broader market's 50%+ decline. Conclusion: Balancing Risk and Return in Automated Trading Effective AI trading bots prioritize risk management over profit maximization. Configure systems to target consistent, moderate returns with minimal drawdowns rather than maximum possible gains. Evaluate performance through risk-adjusted metrics rather than absolute returns, and ensure your strategy performs adequately across all market regimes. Remember that the most successful automated trading approach isn't necessarily the one with the highest returns during bull markets, but the one that preserves capital during downturns while delivering acceptable performance over complete market cycles.

2025-06-01T14:45:19,"XRP Price Prediction: Price Hovering Around $2.16 – Is XRP Building the Strength Needed to Break $3?","XRP is currently trading at $2.16, up 0.66% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of over $1.82 billion. The recent price move is on the back of Bitcoin’s slight gain, but XRP’s fundamentals are quietly improving. Ripple’s active role in exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is boosting optimism.

The descending trendline is applying pressure, and the 50-period EMA at $2.2469 is acting as dynamic resistance. The price structure is exhibiting lower highs and lower lows, with strong selling momentum. But recent candlestick formations, Doji and Spinning Top patterns, are hinting at a pause. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview MACD indicators are bearish, the MACD line is below the signal line, and the histogram bars are red. XRP is currently above a key support zone between $2.0814 and $2.0209, an area of previous buying interest.

2025-06-01T14:41:30,"Expert Predicts When XRP Will Bottom for Next Rally","Renowned Crypto analyst, WatersAbove, has laid out a bold prediction for XRP’s near-term price action, sparking significant interest within the XRP community. According to WatersAbove’s statement on X, XRP is expected to hit its bottom between June 4th and June 6th, setting the stage for what could be one of the most anticipated rallies in the token’s recent history. With eyes set on a breakout to $10 by late July or early August, the XRP Army is buzzing with anticipation, but also caution, as the analyst warns of significant market manipulation in the days ahead. Dear #XRPArmy the bottom on XRP should be in by June 4th – 6th after June 18th, expect a straight line breakout to $10 by late July / early August in the meantime, watch out for this week ahead June 3rd – 6th will be heavy manipulation — WatersAbove (@WatersAbve) May 31, 2025 June Bottom: The Setup for the Next Surge WatersAbove’s forecast suggests that the XRP price floor will lock in between June 4th and 6th, a timeframe that aligns with broader market shifts anticipated across the crypto space. This bottoming phase is critical, as it may offer the last opportunity for accumulation before XRP begins a major upward trajectory. XRP’s past performance has shown cycles of price suppression followed by sudden breakouts, a trend closely monitored by traders and long-term investors. What makes this forecast particularly compelling is the specificity of the timing. Rather than offering vague “sometime this summer” predictions, WatersAbove narrows it down to a window of just a few days, suggesting that key market signals, possibly linked to on-chain data, liquidity patterns, or technical setups, are pointing to this narrow band as the inflection point. Anticipating the Breakout to $10 Following the anticipated bottom, WatersAbove predicts a straight-line breakout after June 18th, with XRP rocketing toward the $10 mark by late July or early August. If realized, this would represent a staggering multi-fold increase from current price levels, signaling a decisive shift in XRP’s market dynamics. This projection doesn’t come out of thin air. Over the past year, Ripple has seen growth in its international partnerships and the broader adoption of XRP for cross-border payments. Despite Ripple’s notable legal victories, the market hasn’t yet fully reflected these positive developments in its pricing. A breakout to $10 would signal not just speculative excitement, but a recalibration of XRP’s value in light of Ripple’s expanding global role. Short-Term Risks: Manipulation Ahead The long-term outlook from WatersAbove is bullish, but the short-term cautionary notes are equally significant. According to the analyst, the period between June 3rd and June 6th will be marked by heavy market manipulation. This warning highlights the importance of vigilance for traders and investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In past cycles, XRP has been no stranger to volatility, often whipsawing in response to news events, coordinated whale activity, or even broader market corrections tied to Bitcoin’s price movements. Heavy manipulation can manifest in sudden price dumps, fake breakouts, or misleading on-chain activity, all of which can shake out weak hands and confuse market participants. WatersAbove’s warning serves as a reminder that while the path to $10 may be paved with opportunity, it’s also lined with traps designed to derail the impatient or ill-prepared. Broader Context: Why This Rally Matters If WatersAbove’s predictions hold, XRP’s potential rally to $10 would not only be a price milestone but a symbolic one. XRP has long held a distinct place in the crypto landscape, serving both as a utility token for Ripple’s payment solutions and as a focal point in regulatory discussions around digital assets. Achieving a $10 price point would push XRP’s market capitalization deep into the top ranks of the crypto leaderboard, potentially reigniting debates about its role as a bridge currency for global finance. Moreover, such a surge would come at a time when the broader crypto market is poised for renewed institutional interest, particularly as the U.S. advances its regulatory frameworks and spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs gain traction. XRP’s rally could further spotlight altcoins with strong utility and regulatory clarity, setting the stage for a broader shift in market sentiment.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 153,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on Bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator on the weekly chart. The MACD is a technical indicator that tracks the convergence and divergence of moving averages to gauge an asset’s momentum and trend direction while pinpointing potential reversal areas. According to Dave the Wave, BTC’s weekly MACD suggests that Bitcoin is bullish and is primed to hit a diagonal resistance that has marked market tops since 2012. “On the basis of the weekly BTC MACD extension, you’d expect another push up.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that the MACD will rise to the diagonal resistance by the end of the year, just as BTC rallies to $160,000. Zooming out, Dave the Wave says the monthly time frame supports his long-term bullish outlook on BTC. “Longer-term monthly BTC MACD turning upward again…” Source: Dave the Wave/X But in the short term, the analyst thinks that Bitcoin will slide to around $98,000, where it could potentially print a local bottom before sparking new rallies. “Would it be such a terrible thing to see BTC price consolidate to just under $100,000 before moving up again?

2025-06-01T14:30:00,"Cardano support crumbles as whales hit the sell button","Cardano price has slipped in the past few weeks, and the sell-off may continue after it dropped below key support levels and as whales started to capitulate. Cardano ( ADA ) price dropped for five consecutive days, reaching a low of $0.65, its lowest level since May 8. It has dropped by over 21% from its highest point in May and by 50% from its November 2024 high. On-chain data shows that Cardano’s investors have started to capitulate. According to Santiment , the number of ADA holders has dropped to 4.49 million, down from 4.55 million at the highest point in May. More data shows that whales have continued to sell their coins, sign that they expect its price to continue falling. Whales holding between 100 million and 1 billion coins hold 3.02 billion coins today, down from a high of 3.4 billion in April. Cardano whale transactions | Source: Santiment Similarly, those holding between 1 million and 10 million have reduced their holdings to 5.7 billion from the year-to-date high of 6 billion. These sales happened as the number of ADA tokens in profit dropped to 22.69 billion from 27 billion in April. Cardano, once touted as a viable alternative to Ethereum, has continued to underperform across all areas. Its total value locked in decentralized finance has dropped to $391 million, while its cumulative DEX transactions stand at $4 billion. In contrast, Unichain has a TVL of over $702 million, and its DEX volume has jumped to over $14 billion, a few months after its launch. Cardano is now pegging its growth to its integration with Bitcoin ( BTC ), a move it expects will boost its TVL by billions . The argument is that incorporating Bitcoin will enable BTC holders to stake their holdings and earn rewards. However, this technology already exists, and Bitcoin staking platforms like SolvProtocol and Lombard Finance hold billions in assets. You might also like: Can XRP fall back to $2.20? Ripple foundation making moves Cardano price technical analysis ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ADA price has crashed in the past few days. This sell-off continued after it formed a double-top pattern at $0.839. It has now moved below this pattern’s neckline at $0.710, confirming its bearish bias. Cardano has also plunged below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and is at risk of forming a death cross. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling as sellers target the psychological point at $0.50, down by 25% below the current level. Cardano audit Cardano also finds itself on the receiving end of damning allegations made by non-fungible token artist Masato Alexander. Founder Charles Hoskinson , Alexander alleges, misappropriated $619 million in ADA tokens. Hoskinson denied the allegations. An audit is currently in the works to debunk the claims, he said. If the audit clears the project of these accusations, investors’ confidence could be restored, triggering a strong rebound in Cardano. However, if the findings raise further concerns, ADA may continue in its recent downtrend. The allegations center on a 318 million ADA transfer during the 2021 Allegra hard fork. Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, launched the project in 2015. The Cardano blockchain officially went live on Sept. 29, 2017. Hoskinson founded the Cardano protocol through IOHK, or Input Output Hong Kong, a blockchain research and engineering company he co-founded with Jeremy Wood. The project was named after Gerolamo Cardano, a 16th-century Italian mathematician, and its native cryptocurrency, ADA, was named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician often credited as the first computer programmer.

2025-06-01T13:35:16,"Crypto Weekly Roundup: SEC Eases Up On Crypto Staking and Binance","The past week in crypto saw significant actions in the shifting regulatory climate, with the SEC easing its stance on staking and dropping its lawsuit against Binance. Major business moves included 21Shares filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF, BlackRock eyeing a Circle IPO stake, and El Salvador making another Bitcoin purchase. Meanwhile, Web3 innovations and market expansions continued globally, alongside new policy moves from India, Thailand, and the UK. Let’s find out more. Bitcoin El Salvador has once again challenged the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) stance on cryptocurrency acquisitions, making a fresh Bitcoin purchase shortly after concluding a key review tied to its $1.4 billion loan agreement. Technology Dubai has formally introduced the region’s first government-backed tokenized real estate platform , a move poised to redefine property investment in the emirate. Business In a notable development for crypto-backed financial products, 21Shares has formally filed an application to launch a spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Global asset management heavyweight BlackRock is reportedly preparing to acquire a 10% stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering, marking another strategic step into the digital asset sector. Christopher Giancarlo , the former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has formally joined Sygnum, the Swiss-based crypto bank, as a senior policy advisor.

Sonic SVM , the first chain-extension platform on Solana, has continued to witness impressive growth metrics across its fledgling ecosystem following a successful mainnet launch and developer hackathon that attracted over 250 project submissions. Meta exchanges (MEXs) are transforming crypto trading by aggregating liquidity, minimizing slippage, and optimizing trade routes across centralized and decentralized platforms, with platforms like SwissBorg leading the charge through real-time price updates, MEV protection, and seamless multi-chain swaps.

Local news outlet Le Monde shared the report, citing an announcement from the Paris public prosecutor’s office. According to previous reports, there has been an increase in the number of crypto-related kidnappings targeting prominent crypto personalities and their relatives since the beginning of the year in Paris. The prosecutor’s office mentioned that the suspects are between the ages of 16 and 23, with about six minors in the mix. The report mentioned that 18 suspects have now been placed in pre-trial detention, three have requested a deferred hearing, while four remain under judicial supervision. France charges 25 suspects in connection with crypto-related kidnappings According to the report, the investigation centers on the botched abduction attempt in Paris’ 11th arrondissement, which occurred on May 13. The targets were the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of the French cryptocurrency exchange Paymium. Although the assailants were able to escape after the failed attempt, they did enough to leave visible damage in their wake, with the husband of the target being hit on the head and eyewitnesses mentioning that blood was everywhere. Authorities mentioned that that was not the first crypto-related kidnapping attempt, with a similar failed attempt being staged the previous day, and the police foiling one some days later. The suspects, according to the report, were from diverse backgrounds, including individuals born in the Paris region, Châtellerault, Senegal, Angola, and Russia. According to the defense attorneys, most of the suspects were young, describing them as “young profiles lured by money and caught in a situation beyond their control.” The Paris case is not the first, as it is part of a rise in crypto-related kidnappings across the country this year. Several high-profile individuals have been affected by the ongoing menace, including Ledger co-founder David Balland and his partner. Another one occurred on May 1, which involved the father of a crypto millionaire in the city. The criminals were said to have carried out brutal attacks on the father, mutilating him to force his son to pay the ransom for his release. Investigators also say the case is linked to the current wave of attacks. French minister convenes urgent meeting, insurance companies to cover risks According to the police, while they have been able to apprehend some of the goons used in wreaking this havoc, the mastermind behind the operations remains unidentified. The incident has also drawn national attention, with France’s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau meeting with crypto industry professionals to discuss protective measures. The ministry later released a memo mentioning enhanced cooperation between law enforcement and crypto firms, including home security checks conducted by the police and gendarmerie officers. Meanwhile, insurers are developing new protections aimed at the growing physical threat against their clients in the target demography. According to a report by NBC News, more than three firms specializing in crypto insurance and security are now preparing tailored kidnap and ransom (K&R) policies for cryptocurrency investors. At the same time, crypto executives and investors have been seeking personal security services for their protection. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-01T13:00:57,"Bitcoin Maxi Max Keiser Isn’t Buying The Hype Around New Crypto Holding Companies","Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser has questioned whether new Bitcoin treasury companies will show the same commitment as Strategy co‐founder Michael Saylor. Related Reading: Pepe Makes It To Trump’s Feed—Is A Crypto Endorsement Next? According to Keiser’s May 30 X post, Saylor kept buying Bitcoin through past market drops without selling, even when his holdings were underwater. He pointed out that Strategy’s imitators have yet to face a real bear market. Based on this, Keiser warned it might be unrealistic to assume these newer firms will stay steady if prices slide. Max Keiser Raises Doubts In a May 30 X post, Keiser wrote, “The Strategy clones have not been tested in a bear market. Saylor never sold and just kept buying, even when his BTC position was underwater. It is foolish to think the new Bitcoin Treasury Strategy clones will have the same discipline.” The @Strategy clones have not been tested in a bear market.@saylor never sold, and just kept buying, even when his BTC position was under water. It’s foolish to think the new Bitcoin Treasury @Strategy clones will have the same discipline. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) May 31, 2025 He had already compared Strategy to “the Bitcoin of BTC treasury plays,” implying that other firms will struggle to match that level of conviction. Short trades and quick flips have driven some copycats so far. Long holds in a downtrend? That’s a different story. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Soar Companies are jumping on the Bitcoin treasury train at a rapid pace. Based on reports, dozens of businesses announced plans to follow Strategy’s lead in the first half of 2025. Some analysts now believe 50% or more of all crypto could soon sit on corporate balance sheets. Strive, the asset management firm led by former political candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, joined on May 7. Trump Media and Technology Group confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin on May 27. Each fresh announcement drives more copycats, which adds to both hype and risk in the space.

Based on reports, analysts argue such high premiums can’t last forever. If Bitcoin dips or demand for stock‐based exposure weakens, those markups could evaporate. Paying $600,000 extra per Bitcoin position today might look very different if prices fall tomorrow.

2025-06-01T13:00:48,"BlackRock & Ark Invest Mulls Major Stake In Circle’s Proposed IPO","Asset manager BlackRock has shown interest in acquiring a 10% stake in USDC stablecoin issuer Circle . The highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) will attract large crypto and traditional finance firms. This follows a thickening institutional plot in the crypto market, adding an extra layer of legitimacy for the high-flying assets. Big Firms Eye Circle’s IPO BlackRock is preparing to acquire part of Circle’s shares in its upcoming IPO, Bloomberg reported , citing sources familiar with the matter. Per a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Circle’s Chief Executive, Jeremy Allaire, plans to raise about $624 million in the IPO. The deal, which is expected on June 4, has recorded multiple orders for the shares available. The sources said the deal’s details are not finalized, and the $9 trillion asset manager could swoop in for a stake through another vehicle or opt out entirely. BlackRock and Circle are not strangers, as previous deals have already been struck. BlackRock manages a money market fund for Circle that backs the USDC stablecoin. The Fund now holds approximately $53.5 billion. USDC adoption is projected to build on gains in the past three quarters. Recent institutional developments in the United States, with its user base soaring, are tipped to favor the asset. Incoming stablecoin rules will also push its compliance in multiple jurisdictions. Circle initially filed for its IPO on April 1 but delayed due to rising economic concerns amid US tariff wars. The company has attracted big crypto firms like Ripple and Coinbase as users flock to its USDC stablecoin. Fortune reported informal sale talks with Coinbase and Ripple. However, Circle insisted it was not for sale following reports of a $4 billion bid deemed too low. According to the rebuttals, Circle remains committed to its long-term goals. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is also preparing a $150 million swoop in Circle’s IPO. Community Expresses Optimism Over Soaring Adoption Digital asset traders remain thrilled as more institutional investors increase their exposure to the crypto market. According to experts, inflows have positioned assets for major upswings in Q2 2025. From investment in Bitcoin mining firms to stablecoin issuers, traditional players have raised the bar.

2025-06-01T13:00:33,"TON Bullish Pattern Signals Breakout Ahead — 40% Rally Loading?","Toncoin (TON), the native token of The Open Network (TON), has climbed over 5% in the past 24 hours, signaling renewed market demand. This rebound comes on the heels of a broader market downturn that saw TON decline alongside other major cryptocurrencies late last week. Amidst these small-scale movements, crypto analyst Ali Martinez notes the altcoin appears to be preparing for a major price breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News Toncoin Charts 40% Move As Triangle Hints At Breakout In an X post on May 31, Ali Martinez shares an insightful take on the TON market. Using the 4-hour trading chart, the expert analyst highlights that TON’s price movement over the past four months has created a symmetrical triangle pattern hinting at the strong potential of a major price breakout. The symmetrical triangle is a neutral chart pattern that reflects price compression due to the formation of higher lows and lower highs. Inherently, this chart pattern suggests neither the buyers or sellers are in affirmative control of the market, indicating there is much potential for a 40% price swing on either side. Currently, Toncoin trades around $3.16 following the recent price bounce. If market bulls force a breakout from the upper boundary around $3.28, the altcoin is expected to trade as high as $4.55-$4.65. Meanwhile, a breakdown at the lower boundary around $3.10 could result in a market price between $1.80-$1.90. Interestingly, TON’s relative strength index currently sits at 49.37 facing the upward direction which also suggests a neutral market while noting that bullish momentum is starting to build. A cross over 50 would provide bulls confirmation as TON makes its way to the overbought zone. Related Reading: Tron (TRX) Future Retail Activity Indicates More Gains Ahead – Analyst TON Market Overview As earlier stated, TON continues to trade at $3.16 reflecting market gains of 5.12% and 4.62% in the past one and seven days, respectively. Telegram LLC which served as initial developers of TON and offers a deep integration with the cryptocurrency project has registered a series of positive developments contributing to these recent price leaps. Most notably, Telegram founder Pavel Durov announced the platform’s partnership with xAI which would grant users in-app access to Grok, the prominent generative AI model. As part of this one year partnership, Telegram is to receive $300 million in cash and equity investment as well as earn 50% of all xAI revenue generated via the messaging platform. With a market cap of $7.79 billion, Toncoin ranks as the ninth largest cryptocurrency in the world despite a year-on-year loss of 49.98%.

2025-06-01T13:00:00,"Chart of the Week: Crypto May Now Have Its Own 'Inverse Cramer' and Profits Are in the Millions","Meet James Wynn, the pseudonymous trader on Hyperliquid who became famous for his $1 billion bitcoin short bet , could now be gaining a new kind of fame: as crypto’s own “Inverse Cramer.” For those unfamiliar with the Cramer lore: he’s the high-octane, loud-money mascot of CNBC’s Mad Money , a former hedge fund manager turned stock picker with a hit-or-miss track record that turned into a meme. Many retail traders started doing the exact opposite of his recommendations, and the idea became so famous that an “Inverse Cramer ETF” was launched (it was later shut down, but the meme lives on). Now, crypto traders might have found their new ""Inverse Jim Cramer"" in James Wynn's trading wallet . ""The winning strategy lately? Do the opposite of James Wynn,"" s aid blockchain sleuth Lookonchain in an X post, pointing to a trader who has been making millions by doing exactly the opposite of James Wynn's trades. ""0x2258 has been counter-trading James Wynn—shorting when James Wynn goes long, and going long when James Wynn shorts. In the past week, 0x2258 has made ~$17M, while James Wynn has lost ~$98M,"" Lookonchain said in the post. Seventeen million dollars in a week just by inverse-betting on one trader is not a bad payday. However, this might be a short-term trade, and one should be very cautious as things can change lightning fast in the trading world, leaving punters millions in losses if not hedged properly. Even James Wynn said, ""I’ll run it back, I always do. And I’ll enjoy doing it. I like playing the game,” after the trader got fully liquidated over the weekend . So, maybe this Reddit gem : ""How much money would you have made if you did the exact opposite of Jim Cramer?"" would never translate to include James Wynn.

The price has lost the 20/50/100 EMA cluster on the 4-hour chart and is now consolidating below the key resistance zone of $105,000–$106,000, a range that capped multiple bounces this week.

However, as the big bull continues its unwavering streak, alternative tokens fail to follow the asset’s direction. Ripple’s XRP , a leading altcoin, was one of many that failed to meet market expectations last week. Despite this, market analysts’ sentiments are firmly within bullish territory. Egrag Crypto, a prominent analyst in the X crypto space, has made an assertion validating multiple bullish possibilities for the asset. The analyst revisits XRP’s 2017 performance and explains that a breakout could be around the corner if the altcoin mimics historical patterns. “If XRP is repeating the last section or pattern from October 2017, we might be on the brink of a major breakout soon! Back in October 2017, XRP took roughly 63 days to explode and set a new all-time high, skyrocketing by an astonishing 1,772%!” He wrote. The analyst added that if XRP follows this pattern, the asset could reach the $27 mark in the next few months. He points to the 21-week EMA as a virtual support level and a last line of defense for the XRP. As such, remaining above the $2.30 price mark could sustain the bullish momentum. For the bullish breakout to occur, XRP bulls are expected to close above the Fib 1.414 level around the $2.70 price mark, which would be indicative of a strong bullish signal going forward. The ultimate target, however, is a break above the $3.00 high reached in February. The analyst remains convinced that this move could happen in the near term. “Cycle analysis: If we mirror October 2017’s duration, the peak might occur around July 21, 2025 — roughly two months from now! A cycle top in July suggests BTC may also challenge new ATHs within the next 40 days.” He concluded.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-27-moonshot-analyst-predicts-1772-explosion-following-2017-historical-pattern/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

He made the comment during Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, where Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, spoke about his party’s new plan. Farage said Reform UK wants the Bank of England to hold a “Bitcoin digital reserve.” He also introduced a bill that would cut capital gains tax on crypto from 24% to 10%. Saylor’s View On Bitcoin Reserves Saylor described Bitcoin as the “ultimate form of capital.” He said investors should think about moving money out of regular currencies and bonds into crypto. His firm, Strategy , has been buying Bitcoin for years. Bank of England on the Brink… of Buying Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/8mdXj0SZ5l — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 30, 2025 Based on reports, US regulators now allow banks to hold and trade crypto . That makes it more likely that big institutions will get involved. If the Bank of England does buy Bitcoin, it would mark a big shift. Central banks usually stick to gold or government bonds. Shifting even a small slice of reserves to Bitcoin could change how people view digital coins. Reform UK’s Crypto Plan Reform UK has opened up to crypto donations, making it the first UK party to do so. Farage said banks must not close accounts for people who buy or sell crypto. He suggested allowing taxpayers to pay tax bills in Bitcoin. The proposed Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill would set new rules to protect crypto users and encourage firms to offer crypto services. Reform UK’s chairman, Zia Yusuf, said cutting crypto taxes could bring rich entrepreneurs back to Britain. He pointed out that a lot of wealthy people leave for places with lower taxes on digital assets. Tax Cuts To Attract Entrepreneurs Reports disclosed that Reform UK wants to drop capital gains tax on crypto from 24% down to 10%. Yusuf said this change could reverse the flow of talent leaving the UK. If companies see they can keep more profits, they might stay or move here. That could lead to more jobs and more tech start-ups. But critics warn that cutting taxes could leave a hole in government revenue. In turn, the Treasury might have to find money elsewhere or cut services.

2025-06-01T12:29:00,"Bitcoin’s Year-End Price Prediction Comes in Hot With Experts Pointing to $200,000","Bitcoin’s rise to the $111,970 price mark has left market participants even more optimistic for the third and final quarters, with fresh bullish price forecasts frequently making the rounds. While the predictions accommodate both bullish and bearish possibilities, price forecasts are going up to $200,000 as an attainable level in 2025. Identifying the factors validating this potential outcome, prominent analyst TradingShot first observed that the BTCUSD pair is experiencing the weakest bull cycle in history, which he believes is a “product of the Theory of Diminishing Returns (TDM).” Notably, the first market cycles appeared to have been more aggressive, with incoming gains hitting rooftop levels, as the market’s upside potential seemed larger in its beginning stages. The analyst revisited the 2025 to 2017 and 2019 to 2021 bull cycles, stating that these periods were in harmony with the traditional capital market. However, the market seems to be headed in a different direction now. “ The current Cycle (2023 – 2025), following the late February 2025 divergence, is now attempting to converge again with its strong rebound in the past 6 weeks. Being however within a Channel Up throughout the entirety of the Cycle, it appears that it will do so in a structured way and as the ( Theory of Diminishing Returns) TDM suggests, will offer weaker gains.” He asserted . He conclusively deduces the timing of the Cycle Top by referring to previous market cycles, projecting that this time, the bull cycle could reach the top between October, November, or December. At this time, the asset is supposed to have hit its peak, around the $150,000 to $200,000 price range. At report time, Bitcoin is down 0.11% over the last hour but has remained above the $104,000 level since hitting a new price high.

2025-06-01T12:26:00,"Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Stuck? ChatGPT Weighs In","TL;DR Bitcoin charted a new all-time high, and even Ethereum managed to post some impressive gains in the past month. However, Ripple’s cross-border token has failed to recapture any of its previous momentum. Here’s what ChatGPT thinks about the current situation and what might be the cause of it. Also, will there be a breakout soon? Current Price Landscape Numerous prominent crypto analysts have outlined in the past several weeks how important the support levels of $2.3 and $2 are for XRP’s future price movements. The former, though, has already been broken to the downside and many of them believe the asset is primed for another retracement toward the latter. Recall that the last time XRP slumped beneath $2 was in early April as the financial world braced for the impact of Trump’s growing and constant tariffs against essentially every country. Although the economic situation improved dramatically in the following two months and many cryptocurrencies, such as the aforementioned new BTC peak and ETH’s revival, marked impressive gains, XRP remained on the sidelines to some extent and was quickly stopped during its surge toward $2.6. It was (and still remains) confined in a descending pattern that has seen another 6.5% decline on a weekly scale. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Why So? ChatGPT first listed the broader market conditions as one of the reasons behind XRP’s stagnation, but that sounds accurate only if we take into account the past week, in which many digital assets have turned red. However, XRP has been outperformed by ETH, BTC, and many, many alts, such as HYPE , on a monthly scale as well. The AI solution noted that investor sentiment and behavior have changed lately toward XRP, as the post-US election hype has evaporated. Now, even though Ripple essentially won its legal fight against the SEC, investors are “opting to sell during minor price increases rather than holding for long-term gains.” ChatGPT mentioned XRP’s tokenomics, in which a billion new coins are released monthly. According to its answer, this continues to add selling pressure for XRP and may hinder its progress. “This consistent increase in available tokens can suppress price growth, especially if demand doesn’t keep pace.” On the question of what could help XRP break out of its consolidation, the AI chatbot said it might take a significant change in investor behavior, such as whales going on a massive accumulation spree similar to the one at the end of 2024, as well as an overall improvement in the market. Additionally, big partnership or acquisitions can aso fuel a new rally. The post Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Stuck?

2025-06-01T12:16:33,"Anthony Scaramucci says Solana will Seamlessly Substitute Banks for IPOs","SkyBridge’s Anthony Scaramucci, while speaking at the Solana Accelerate conference, made some key predictions about the Solana ecosystem. Scaramucci most notably affirmed that bringing Initial public offerings (IPOs) on-chain is possible and allows non-traditional users affiliated with banks to purchase IPOs through their wallets. “You can actually crowdsource the public offering through the tokenization process.” He remarked. When asked about the state of institutional investors and their interest levels in Solana, he revealed that he was authoring a book on Solana titled “Solana Rising”. While interviewing Chief Technology Officers around Wall Street for the book, he revealed that Solana’s scale, functionality, affordability, and throughput position the network to become one of the principal rail systems. “If Bitcoin is the operating layer for money, Solana will be the operating layer for real-world assets, stocks, bonds, and tokenization.” He asserted. Speaking of skeptics, particularly Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who maintains that he is not a fan of Bitcoin and has shown almost no interest in the broader crypto market, Scaramucci believes he will “come around.” He explains that Dimon, surrounded by Senator Elizabeth Warren, tasked with regulating the financial system, is understandably “towing the line.” He further credits the Trump administration for reshaping the system. Scaramucci conclusively disclosed that he and Michael Saylor are fixed on the process of assets transitioning into yield-bearing assets. “Solana certainly, you have the staking situation, but Solana is going to be a healthy enough operating system where you’re going to be able to lend your Solana out, go to a Goldman Sachs of crypto, like a Galaxy, post up your Solana. Sure, you’ll get your staking, but you will also be able to lend it out and get yield in addition to that.” He remarked.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/anthony-scaramucci-says-solana-will-seamlessly-substitute-banks-for-ipos/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TECHNOLOGY","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare
2025-06-01T12:16:14,"European champion, PSG taps RTB Digital to launch Web3 fan platform","Football powerhouse, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), has entered into a partnership with Web3 firm RTB Digital, launching an initiative off the pitch. According to reports, the partnership has birthed a digital platform for its fans called PSG World. The launch of the PSG World platform was announced earlier, with the platform going live just before the UEFA Champions League final, where its men’s team came out victorious in a 5-0 victory over Italian side Internazionale. According to the club, the latest initiative is a push forward in its strategy to strengthen the relationship between its fans across the world. The platform was also designed to act as a forum for members. PSG launches new platform to strengthen fan relationships According to the football club, the platform will provide a home for its supporters to share their pre-match and post-match thoughts, acting as a commentary center for the fans. Users will also be able to co-create content, access exclusive media, and build global connections around their football club. Speaking at the Bitcoin Conference in 2025, Pär Helgosson, Head of PSG Labs, discussed the vision of the French club for PSG World. The discussion also involved other prominent members of the crypto community, including the founder and CEO of Roundtable, James Heckman, and Managing Partner at Blockchain Founders Fund, Aly Madhavji. “As we look ahead, our mission is to deepen our connection with fans — not just in France, but around the world,” Pär Helgosson said. “And that means meeting them where they are, online, on-chain, and in their culture.” Helgosson also added that one of the issues of today is that clubs don’t try enough to own their audience data, and PSG is planning to fix it with the new platform. “We have all these fans running for us but they’re not always on our platforms,” he said. “The challenge is to build a direct channel — to capture more data, understand our fans better, and engage them in more relevant ways.” According to the club, the platform will be powered by RTB, a SaaS technology company providing full-stack, white-label community and infrastructure for brands, journalists, and creators. RTB’s vision fulfills the dream of premium brands by uniting them under a single Web3 SaaS platform. The architecture also offers an array of features, tools, and distribution assets, which are already being used by several partners. Helgosson says the club will tap its global reach Speaking alongside Madhavji, Helgosson discussed the scale of the club’s audience, noting that the club is as big in all parts of the world as they are in France, even bigger in some places. Heckman also added contact to the club’s global footprint, noting the number of players they have from diverse countries. “A team in Paris has stars from Argentina, Brazil, Italy, England, and Germany. When you claimed half a billion fans, it sounded ludicrous — but it’s actually true,” he said. Founded in 1970, PSG has grown into one of the most recognizable brands in world football. With its digital presence expanding, the club is prepared to unveil this new model of sports engagement. However, the strategy isn’t about just the reach, it is about building a meaningful and persistent relationship with its fans. The platform adds physical, digital, and blockchain-based tools to shape that interaction. “We dominated social, online today. And we also want to dominate in on-chain and all tokenized ways,” Helgosson said. “We want to engage our fan base across what we do offline, online today — and on-chain tomorrow.” Helgosson also mentioned that the club has taken some financial bets on Bitcoin, noting that it took some of its fiat reserves and allocated it into Bitcoin last year. He added that they are the largest club doing it globally. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-06-01T11:46:43,"Bitcoin Rich List: Who’s Stacking, Who’s Slacking?","The post Bitcoin Rich List: Who’s Stacking, Who’s Slacking? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In recent months, many major companies around the world have started buying large amounts of Bitcoin. It seems like every few days, there’s news about another business joining the growing list of Bitcoin investors. One of the first big names in this space was MicroStrategy, led by its CEO, Michael Saylor. Years ago, the company began buying Bitcoin, and since then, its stock price has jumped by an incredible 3,000%. Saylor has said he believes other companies will have no choice but to follow, especially as Bitcoin prices keep rising. Why Are More Companies Buying Bitcoin? As explained by an analyst, it’s simple: when a few companies start buying Bitcoin and their stock prices rise, other businesses take notice. Soon, more companies feel pressured to join in, which pushes Bitcoin’s price even higher. As the price rises, it becomes more expensive for new buyers to enter the market, which creates a rush to buy before prices climb further. New Player From Indonesia A company called DigiAsia from Indonesia has just announced its plans to buy $100 million worth of Bitcoin. While it’s not as big as MicroStrategy’s investments, it’s still a huge amount. What’s more surprising is that DigiAsia plans to use 50% of its future profits to keep buying Bitcoin. This shows they’re serious about making cryptocurrency a key part of their financial strategy. More Big Numbers from Other Companies Another company called MetaPlanet has also been making headlines. They want to build a Bitcoin reserve of 10,000 Bitcoins by the end of this year, and 21,000 by the end of next year. Recently, they revealed they’ve already collected over 6,700 Bitcoins — much faster than expected. The big question now is: with Bitcoin’s price expected to rise to around $370,000 to $500,000 by the end of this year, will these companies still be willing to buy more at such high prices? And what will happen if Bitcoin hits $2.4 million by 2029 or 2030, as some predictions suggest? What Does This Mean for Regular Bitcoin Holders? Every time a company buys thousands of Bitcoins, it reduces the number of coins available for everyone else. Some experts have said that one day, even millionaires and billionaires won’t be able to buy a full Bitcoin because so many have been taken off the market by big companies. There’s an old idea in the crypto world that owning just 0.28 Bitcoin would put you in the top 1% of Bitcoin holders. Back then, people thought it was a small number. But with companies grabbing up huge amounts of Bitcoin, that 0.28 BTC is starting to look a lot more valuable. In Short More and more companies are buying Bitcoin as a long-term investment. As these businesses keep adding to their Bitcoin reserves, it could drive prices up and make it harder for others to buy in the future. And if Bitcoin reaches the price levels some experts predict, it’ll make the small amounts of Bitcoin owned by regular investors even more valuable.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-rich-list-whos-stacking-whos-slacking/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that BTC has until Monday to avoid printing a bearish divergence on the weekly chart. A bearish divergence happens when price makes higher highs, while an indicator like the relative strength index (RSI) makes lower highs, suggesting that an asset is losing bullish momentum. Says Woo, “Dear Mr Bitcoin, you have [until Monday] to rally or you’re gonna print a bearish divergence on weekly charts and then we will be bored for weeks and weeks.” Source: Willy Woo/X Using proprietary data from his Bitcoin analysis firm, the Bitcoin Vector, Woo says that BTC appears to be strong, but may be “equalizing” itself after rallying faster than usual in previous months. “Our Bitcoin Vector framework remains strong despite the pullback. What’s happening is technical resistance in the form of a bearish divergence playing out against strong fundamentals. Basically, BTC ran up faster than normal and is equalizing.” Source: Willy Woo/X While many traders are still betting on the traditional halving-based four-year cycles, Woo says BTC is becoming more linked to external macro forces, and that predictable, cyclical price patterns are now a thing of the past. “BTC is global macro this cycle. Which means don’t necessarily bet on nicely manicured four-year cycles. BTC is transitioning.

The items, sold exclusively via the Bitcoin-only marketplace Scarce City, offered collectors a chance to own a piece of crypto history, just months after Ulbricht was pardoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump. The auction, which included both personal effects from before Ulbricht’s 2013 arrest and memorabilia from his time behind bars, attracted strong interest from the crypto community. Items ranged from a well-worn sleeping bag and backpack to prison clothing, artwork, and even his final prison-issued ID card . “I’ve left Arizona, the state where I was in prison. It’s time to travel. That means downsizing and turning the page,” Ulbricht wrote on the auction page. “I don’t need the reminders and I’m sure some of you will love to have them.” ID Card Sells for Over $1 Million Among the most coveted items was Ulbricht’s final prison ID card, which sold for an astonishing 11 BTC — over $1.1 million at current prices. “The guard tried to get me to stop smiling for the photo, but my joy comes from within,” Ulbricht remarked in a personal note. “So I smiled that day, even though I was in prison.” Another standout was a painting co-created by Ulbricht and a fellow inmate known as “Omega,” which fetched 1.01 BTC. Ulbricht described the piece as a symbol of hope: “It gave me the feeling that, if I could pass through it, something better would be on the other side.” The auction was structured to ensure fairness, requiring a 1% collateral deposit from bidders and a resettable countdown to deter last-minute bid sniping. All payments must be finalized by June 2, with Bitcoin preferred, although small PayPal payments were accepted. Ulbricht Dormant Bitcoin Holdings Beyond the auction, Ulbricht could potentially regain access to millions in dormant Bitcoin. According to Coinbase’s Conor Grogan, about 430 BTC — currently worth around $47 million — remain untouched in wallets tied to Ulbricht that were never seized. Blockchain firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed the findings, identifying 14 such wallets . One of them alone holds over $9 million in BTC. These funds have been inactive for more than 13 years, stirring speculation about their future use following Ulbricht’s release.

Its price is stuck at the same level where it began the year, underperforming Bitcoin, which has risen 15% in 2025. Ripple ( XRP ) price was trading at $2.140 on Sunday as its volume and futures open interest remained under pressure. This article highlights the top four reasons it may jump by 50% and retest the year-to-date high of $3.4 in June. You might also like: Bitcoin price pulls back as analysts tout $1m–$2.4m potential The Securities and Exchange Commission will decide on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF by June 17. Approval would likely help boost the XRP price because of the expected inflows from Wall Street investors. JPMorgan analysts estimate the fund would attract over $8 billion in funds in the first year. However, the likely scenario is that the SEC delays the approval again, possibly until October. Polymarket traders place the odds of approval by July 31 at 21%, and by the end of the year at 83% . Crypto traders are pricing an eventual XRP price breakout in the coming weeks. The eight-hour funding rate has remained in the positive zone in the past few weeks. A positive funding rate is essential data in perpetual futures, meaning traders anticipate the price to be higher. As we wrote here , there are signs that Bitcoin will make a bullish breakout. We cited the bullish forecasts by top analysts and the fact that it is forming the handle section of the cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern points to an eventual Bitcoin surge to $143,000. A Bitcoin price breakout will likely push other cryptocurrencies, including XRP, higher. The final reason the Ripple price may break out and surge to $3.4 is its strong technicals. See below. XRP funding rate | Source: CoinGlass XRP technicals The accumulation and distribution indicators point to increased accumulation. This means that XRP may now be in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. It will move to the markup, which has higher demand than supply. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The XRP price has remained slightly above the 200-day moving average. It has also formed a giant bullish pennant pattern, comprising a vertical line and a triangle. A pennant often leads to a strong bullish breakout. XRP has also formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. As such, a breakout will see it retest the resistance at $3.3842, up almost 50% from the current level.

Specifically, Master Ananda’s analysis shows that the $100,000 to $103,000 range now serves as Bitcoin’s key support. If this level fails, traders should brace for a red week followed by sideways consolidation before any meaningful recovery, according to a May 31 post on TradingView. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Ananda noted that Bitcoin has already dipped into this zone, and the market is watching closely to see if it will hold or break under pressure. His analysis emphasized the critical nature of this range. Bitcoin recently reversed from highs near $112,000, pulling back to test support. If the level breaks, a deeper correction could follow, with downside targets near $88,000, a key Fibonacci retracement level. However, if support holds, the analyst expects a sharp rebound that could push Bitcoin to new highs above $130,000. “Between $100,000 and $103,000. If this level breaks, prepare to see Bitcoin producing another week red then consolidation, on and on, before the next high,” he said. While the short-term outlook is uncertain, Ananda remains bullish in the long run. He pointed out that retracements are typical and healthy in any uptrend. He also suggested the current pullback may offer a rare buying opportunity for those who missed earlier entries. Bitcoin’s price next key target This analysis comes as Bitcoin attempts to reclaim the $105,000 support zone , which could anchor a move to new highs. Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin ended May with its highest monthly close on record. Looking ahead, market analysts believe Bitcoin could resume its bullish trend and target new highs above $120,000. In a June 1 post on X, Pseudonymous analyst Mags noted that Bitcoin is completing a bullish “cup and handle” breakout pattern, with a potential target of $125,000. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Mags The pattern is a continuation setup where an asset forms a rounded bottom (“cup”) followed by a consolidation (“handle”). A breakout above the resistance neckline often leads to a rally roughly equal to the depth of the cup. This supports the view that Bitcoin’s breakout from the $65,000 to $70,000 resistance channel has laid the groundwork for further gains. Following the breakout, Bitcoin has already crossed the $100,000 threshold and continues to push higher. Bitcoin price analysis At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $104,009, up 0.5% over the past 24 hours, though down 5.5% on the week. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

Traders Divided as Market Cools Off","Bitcoin (BTC) smashed a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 on May 22, but the party may be over, at least for now. After rallying by more than $15,000 over the month, the king crypto has shed $9,000 in the last week alone, slipping to the $103,000 level, putting traders on edge and sparking new debate: Is this a healthy cooldown or the start of a deeper plunge? Technical Red Flags Flashing Volatility is back with a vengeance. In the last 24 hours, BTC has swung between $103,300 and $105,000, reflecting growing market uncertainty. Zooming out, it’s still up 9.1% in the last 30 days and 52.1% over the past year, but the momentum seems to be fading. According to data shared by analyst Axel Adler Jr., Bitcoin just triggered four consecutive sell signals on CryptoQuant’s Net UTXO Supply ratio. “This is a typical pattern for an overheated market phase, where profit-taking occurs and demand begins to lag supply,” he warned, highlighting the red flag that often comes before short-term tops. Further, the market watcher pointed to two possible scenarios for the asset: a sideways purgatory, with BTC drifting sideways between $95,000 and $105,000 for weeks, or a mid pullback that could see it plunge toward $92,000 in a bid to “relieve overbought conditions.” Betting Big on Bitcoin However, others are more optimistic, or delusional, depending on who you ask. According to BetIdeas in an email to CryptoPotato , there’s an 80% chance of BTC hitting $120,000 in 2025, and a 40% shot at $150,000. “The volatile nature of crypto is what will always grab the headlines but with the upwards trend in May with Bitcoin being increasingly positive, it looks as though a big run for Bitcoin holders is coming,” wrote spokesman Steve McQuillan. He stated that traders on the platform had placed a 22% chance on a run toward $200,000 before the end of the year. Meanwhile, popular analyst Daan Crypto Trades has pointed to the zone between $97,000 and $99,000 as a key level to watch for a potential bounce, citing Fibonacci retracement levels and the 200-day moving average. Elsewhere, Michaël van de Poppe doesn’t seem too fazed by the current goings on in the market, terming it “consolidation and correction,” which, in his opinion , is “very healthy and normal.” The post Bitcoin to $150K or Back to $92K?

It raised concerns over legal risks and energy strain. Pakistan advances national crypto and blockchain strategy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is pushing back on Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers as the country navigates tough financial negotiations with the Fund. The initiative, unveiled last week, is part of a broader push to attract blockchain firms, AI companies, and crypto miners to Pakistan. However, according to a report by local outlet Samaa , the IMF has flagged several concerns — primarily the legality of crypto mining in the country and the strain such a move could place on its already fragile power grid. IMF Seeks Urgent Clarification on Pakistan’s Crypto Mining Plan The IMF was reportedly not consulted ahead of the announcement and is now seeking urgent clarification from the Finance Ministry. With Pakistan facing chronic energy shortages and inflationary pressures, the Fund has also warned about potential knock-on effects on power tariffs and resource distribution. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” an official involved in the negotiations told Samaa . “The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the talks.” While I'm an optimist by nature and I really hope I'm wrong, I think Pakistan will struggle to follow through on its Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining plans Short answer why: IMF Mid-sized answer why: * Bitcoin is a huge threat to IMF in 5 ways. * Pakistan are heavily indebted… pic.twitter.com/4t4BO6Keqm — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) May 31, 2025 The IMF delegation, which is currently holding virtual discussions with Pakistani authorities, is expected to hold a dedicated session on the electricity plan for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers in the coming days. The power allocation is part of a wider national strategy to integrate digital assets into Pakistan’s economy. A key piece of this strategy is the new Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), approved by the Finance Ministry on May 21. The PDAA will oversee the regulation of exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and the tokenization of national assets in line with global standards, including those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Pakistan Launches Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The move follows Pakistan’s surprise debut of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference last week. During the event, Bilal bin Saqib, crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, unveiled plans for a national Bitcoin wallet and reaffirmed the government’s support for the digital asset sector. Pakistan began shifting its crypto policy earlier this year with the proposal of a “National Crypto Council,” tasked with building a regulatory framework and driving foreign investment into the country’s emerging crypto ecosystem. Last week, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif elevated Bilal Bin Saqib to the role of Special Assistant to the PM on Blockchain and Crypto, granting him the status of a minister of state. As Special Assistant, Saqib will be tasked with key responsibilities: drafting FATF-compliant crypto regulations, launching state-backed Bitcoin mining projects, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, land records, and finance. He will also supervise licensing of virtual asset service providers and advance investor protection measures in the Web3 space.

2025-06-01T10:31:11,"Crypto users lost $244M to scammers in May, down 40% from April: PeckShield","Crypto scammers made away with about $244 million in the month of May, a new PeckShield report has shown. According to the report, the stolen amount dropped drastically from April stats, with the largest incident making up 90% of the month’s total. According to a post by PeckShield on X, the blockchain security firm mentioned that the crypto industry recorded about 20 hacks, pushing the total amount lost to $244.1 million. “In May 2025, ~20 major crypto hacks were recorded, resulting in total losses of $244.1M — a 39.29% decrease from April,” PeckShied said. The decline comes as the crypto industry has been putting measures in place and stepping up efforts to combat these activities. Funds from the Cetus DEX hack frozen According to the blockchain security firm, the biggest hack that occurred last month happened on the Cetus decentralized exchange. The platform suffered a breach on May 22, resulting in the loss of about $223 million in users’ funds. The incident was reported by pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3, who posted on X that the Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited. According to blockchain security firm Dedaub, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MBS) check. #PeckShieldAlert In May 2025, ~20 major crypto hacks were recorded, resulting in total losses of $244.1M—a 39.29% decrease from April. Notably, @CetusProtocol & #SUI have frozen a combined $157M of stolen funds (representing 71% recovery from the $220M theft). #Top 5 Hacks in… pic.twitter.com/ZJmGZvbthS — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) June 1, 2025 The firm mentioned that the exploit allowed the threat actors to manipulate values for the liquidity parameters by orders of magnitude. It then allowed them to establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. “This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens,” the blockchain security firm said in its report. PeckShield added that Cetus and the Sui Network had frozen about $157 million in stolen funds, which represents about 71% of the entire cache. PeckShield noted that the second-largest exploit of May was the attack on the decentralized finance platform Cork Protocol . According to cybersecurity firm Cyvers, the Cork Protocol hacker used the exploit to cart away about 3,761 Wrapped States Ether (wstETH), which they converted to Ethereum. The last three of the top five hacks for the month were an MBU tokens exploit worth $2.2 million, a MapleStory Universe exploit of $1.2 million, and an attack suspected to be linked to the DPRK, worth $5.2 million. Industry steps up the war against crypto hackers The PeckShield report comes after increased efforts by the crypto industry to protect itself against bad actors. According to previous reports, the security team of crypto exchange BitMEX released a report where it mentioned that it discovered gaps in the operational security of the Lazarus group, a North Korean cybercrime group that is alleged to have ties to the government of the country. During the counter operations probe into the organization, the platform discovered IP addresses, a database, and tracking algorithms deployed by the group. According to some of the security researchers, there is a likelihood that one of the hackers in the group accidentally revealed his true IP address, which they said showed the actual location of the hacker to be in Jiaxing, China. The researchers also said they were also able to access a Supabase database, a platform for easily deploying databases with simple interfaces for applications, used by the hacking group. According to PeckShield, the crypto industry lost over $1.63 billion to hackers, with the blockchain security platform pointing out that the Bybit exploit accounted for more than 92% of the entire loss. The firm also pointed out that over $487 million in crypto was lost to hackers in January, while February saw a jump to $1.53 billion due to the Bybit incident, which has been dubbed the largest crypto heist to date.

2025-06-01T10:10:35,"SEC Challenges ETF Status of Proposed Staked Solana and Ether Funds","Key Takeaways: The SEC has questioned the structure of proposed staked Solana and Ether ETFs. The agency flagged the C-corp structure as conflicting with ETF regulations. Final decisions on staking ETFs are likely delayed until October. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised concerns about the structure of proposed Solana (SOL) and Ether (ETH) staked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), arguing that the products may not qualify as ETFs under current regulations. ETF provider REX Financial and asset manager Osprey Funds recently submitted amendments for the funds’ registration. However, according to Bloomberg, the SEC flagged the use of a c-corporation (c-corp) structure, a rare choice for ETFs, as conflicting with Rule 6C-11, commonly referred to as the “ETF rule,” which defines permitted fund structures. SEC Flags Compliance Issues in Proposed ETF Structures The SEC staff said they continue to have unresolved questions about whether the proposed funds, if structured and operated as planned, meet the definition of an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act, according to a letter dated May 30. The letter further warned that disclosures about the funds’ investment company status “may be potentially misleading.” Despite the regulatory pushback, analysts remain hopeful. “REX lawyers say they can work it out,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a May 31 post on X. “Issuers are pushing the envelope hard in an effort to get first to market.” Update: SEC sent letter to REX last night saying it was concerned SEC improperly filed. REX lawyer says they can work it out. Feels a bit like the $PRIV situation. Issuers pushing envelope hard in effort to get first to mkt. Saturday scoop from @isabelletanlee https://t.co/6fnYf5Oo2V pic.twitter.com/NHTvOQyDsO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 31, 2025 Market participants are closely tracking the progress of altcoin and staking-based ETFs, viewing them as a potential gateway for fresh institutional capital to enter the crypto sector. The SEC’s caution comes even after it clarified earlier this year that crypto staking, in itself, does not constitute a securities transaction. Still, the agency has delayed rulings on several staking and altcoin ETF applications. These delays are not unexpected. “Almost all of these filings have final due dates in October,” Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart wrote. “It is uncommon for ETF applications to be approved so early.” BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Sees Record $430M Outflows As reported, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded $430.8 million in outflows on May 30, ending a 31-day inflow streak — its longest since launch. The move marks IBIT’s largest single-day outflow to date, according to Farside data, following a month where BlackRock added $6.2 billion in Bitcoin. Despite the pullback, IBIT’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at around $70 billion. The outflows were part of a broader trend across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $616.1 million in net redemptions on May 30 — the second consecutive day of outflows. The previous day had seen $346.8 million withdrawn. Notably, BlackRock was the only issuer to post inflows on May 29, even as others saw redemptions.

2025-06-01T10:00:28,"Bitcoin Still Bullish, But $200,000 Off The Table And $137,000 In Sight","Bitcoin’s price action has drawn a sharp dividing line between long-term bullish expectations and short-term reality. After peaking above $111,000 in May, the Bitcoin price has entered a retracement phase and is now trading below $105,000. While some interpret the current downturn as a sign of a weakening trend, others see it as a textbook bullish correction. Among them is crypto analyst MasterAnanda, whose latest chart suggests that Bitcoin is structurally strong enough to reach new highs, but it might fall short of the speculated $200,000 price target this cycle. Related Reading: No Room For Doubt: Analyst’s $900K Bitcoin Forecast Follows Familiar Script MasterAnanda Predicts Higher Low And $137,000 Target In his TradingView post, MasterAnanda stated clearly that Bitcoin is still in a bullish structure, but he believes a $200,000 peak is out of reach for this cycle. Instead, he identified $137,000 as the more realistic upside target when Bitcoin finally rebounds from the ongoing correction. According to the analyst, the formation of a higher low on the larger time frame will be an important confirmation that Bitcoin’s macro uptrend remains intact. He outlined $88,888.88 as an ideal retracement level to make this perfect higher low, because it aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level and comes in well above the prior bottom at $74,500 on April 7. Despite the current sell-off, MasterAnanda argues that the broader trend is healthy. “Bitcoin will never ever trade below $80,000 in its history again,” he declared, ruling out any deep reversal below the prior low. On the other hand, the analyst also noted that if Bitcoin holds above $100,000 to $102,000, this retracement would be considered minor, with price action still classified as bullish continuation rather than a breakdown. If Bitcoin bulls manage to keep prices trading above that area, it would suggest the current move is nothing more than a short-term dip. When that moment arrives, the bias will shift from short to long, and a rally to $137,000. However, a clean break below the $100,000 price level would mark a significant shift in how long Bitcoin reaches new highs. Chart From TradingView: MasterAnanda RLinda Echoes $101,000 Support For Bitcoin Adding to the analysis, another trader, RLinda, shared a 4-hour chart perspective showing how Bitcoin is currently in a fragile recovery path. She agrees that Bitcoin is still operating within a bullish context, but flagged the $102,000 and $101,400 zones as vital structural supports. Her chart suggests that the false breakout at the key $110,000 resistance level is the end of the recent rally leg, and the current decline could be a liquidity-driven correction rather than a complete reversal of the bullish trend. Furthermore, RLinda’s analysis shows that Bitcoin has exited its upward channel. The outcome, she said, will depend heavily on whether support levels at $102,000 and $101,400 can hold. A bounce from these levels could lead to a retest of the $106,000 to $108,000 resistance zone, where market direction may become clearer. If bulls fail to hold $101,000, it could invite a more dramatic sell-off that pushes the Bitcoin price toward a local bottom or even deeper.
