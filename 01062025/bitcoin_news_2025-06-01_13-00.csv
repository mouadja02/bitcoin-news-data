2025-06-01T10:55:30,"IMF Warns Against Pakistan’s Power Push for Bitcoin Mining, AI Data Centers","Key Takeaways: The IMF has questioned Pakistan’s plan to power Bitcoin mining and AI centers. It raised concerns over legal risks and energy strain. Pakistan advances national crypto and blockchain strategy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is pushing back on Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers as the country navigates tough financial negotiations with the Fund. The initiative, unveiled last week, is part of a broader push to attract blockchain firms, AI companies, and crypto miners to Pakistan. However, according to a report by local outlet Samaa , the IMF has flagged several concerns — primarily the legality of crypto mining in the country and the strain such a move could place on its already fragile power grid. IMF Seeks Urgent Clarification on Pakistan’s Crypto Mining Plan The IMF was reportedly not consulted ahead of the announcement and is now seeking urgent clarification from the Finance Ministry. With Pakistan facing chronic energy shortages and inflationary pressures, the Fund has also warned about potential knock-on effects on power tariffs and resource distribution. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” an official involved in the negotiations told Samaa . “The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the talks.” While I'm an optimist by nature and I really hope I'm wrong, I think Pakistan will struggle to follow through on its Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining plans Short answer why: IMF Mid-sized answer why: * Bitcoin is a huge threat to IMF in 5 ways. * Pakistan are heavily indebted… pic.twitter.com/4t4BO6Keqm — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) May 31, 2025 The IMF delegation, which is currently holding virtual discussions with Pakistani authorities, is expected to hold a dedicated session on the electricity plan for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers in the coming days. The power allocation is part of a wider national strategy to integrate digital assets into Pakistan’s economy. A key piece of this strategy is the new Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), approved by the Finance Ministry on May 21. The PDAA will oversee the regulation of exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and the tokenization of national assets in line with global standards, including those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Pakistan Launches Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The move follows Pakistan’s surprise debut of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference last week. During the event, Bilal bin Saqib, crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, unveiled plans for a national Bitcoin wallet and reaffirmed the government’s support for the digital asset sector. Pakistan began shifting its crypto policy earlier this year with the proposal of a “National Crypto Council,” tasked with building a regulatory framework and driving foreign investment into the country’s emerging crypto ecosystem. Last week, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif elevated Bilal Bin Saqib to the role of Special Assistant to the PM on Blockchain and Crypto, granting him the status of a minister of state. As Special Assistant, Saqib will be tasked with key responsibilities: drafting FATF-compliant crypto regulations, launching state-backed Bitcoin mining projects, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, land records, and finance. He will also supervise licensing of virtual asset service providers and advance investor protection measures in the Web3 space.

2025-06-01T10:54:08,"De-Dollarization and Pepe Wars: 3 Best Altcoins Surging as the World Ditches USD","The crypto world is buzzing again – but this time, it’s not just memes or moonshots. There’s a perfect storm brewing, where global macro fears meet meme coin mania, and it’s shaking up what investors consider ‘safe.’ With the U.S. dollar facing growing scrutiny and meme coins staging a dramatic comeback, crypto isn’t just an alternative – it’s becoming a main event. From high-level financial warnings to playful battles between frog and dog meme coins, we’re watching two powerful narratives collide. And in the middle of it all? A wave of altcoins gaining real traction. Today’s list isn’t about hype alone. It’s about how serious shifts in the financial system are pushing people to look for opportunity – and how some of the best altcoins are stepping into the spotlight. The Dollar’s Decline and the Rise of Altcoins It’s not every day that the CEO of JPMorgan Chase sounds the alarm about the future of the U.S. dollar. But Jamie Dimon just did. In an interview with CNBC at the Reagan National Economic Forum, he warned that if the U.S. government doesn’t get its act together – specifically by fixing its mounting debt and improving relations with global allies – the dollar could lose its status as the world’s reserve currency. That would be a seismic event in finance, shaking the foundation of everything from global trade to individual savings. At the same time, meme coins are heating up again. Pepe, one of 2023’s viral sensations, is making headlines with bold plans to overtake Shiba Inu in market cap. The project’s developers have doubled down on marketing, community engagement, and token burn strategies to boost scarcity and value. But it’s not just about memes anymore. This new wave of tokens is smarter, more innovative, and backed by serious community vision – or even cutting-edge tech like AI. Between financial uncertainty and meme-driven optimism, the stage is set. Investors are eyeing altcoins that offer more than laughs. Let’s look at three of the new crypto projects gaining momentum right now. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – The First Solana Layer 2 and a Game-Changer for Web3 Solaxy ($SOLX) isn’t just another blockchain project – it’s the first-ever Layer 2 built on Solana. That’s a big deal. Solana is known for its blazing speed and low fees, but it has struggled with congestion, scalability issues, and failed transactions. Solaxy fixes all that. It neutralizes the weak points of Solana while supercharging its strengths, delivering a faster, smoother, and more reliable experience for users and developers alike. At its core, Solaxy is a Web3 infrastructure upgrade. It gives developers a powerful platform to build next-gen decentralized apps and meme coins without worrying about performance bottlenecks. Solaxy also empowers everyday meme coin traders by offering sniper bot speed – without needing any technical skills. And the best part? $SOLX is a multichain token, operating on both Solana and Ethereum. That means access to the fastest ecosystem and the most liquid one. With nearly $43M already raised and a token price of just $0.001742, investor momentum is red-hot. But the crypto presale ends in just 15 days – so if you’re looking to buy $SOLX , now’s your last chance. 2. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – Meme Mastery Meets Cutting-Edge AI Mind of Pepe ($MIND) is the world’s first meme coin with a fully autonomous AI agent driving its ecosystem. And here’s the urgent bit: the presale is almost over, and the token officially launches this Tuesday. With over $12M already raised and a final presale price of just $0.0037515, this is the last chance to grab $MIND before it hits the open market. At the center of it all is a self-evolving, self-sovereign AI. It’s not just for show. This AI spots trends before they blow up using hive-mind analysis, interacts with influencers, and delivers token-gated alpha to holders. It can even launch new tokens on the fly – giving $MIND holders first-in access to fresh opportunities. Now let’s talk numbers. If $MIND hits its forecasted 2025 high of $0.00535, that’s a 42.6% gain from today’s price. Presale buyers can also stake their $MIND for passive income. Let’s say you buy 100K $MIND today at $375.15 and stake it for 20% APY. In one year, you’ll have 120K tokens. At today’s price, that’s $450. At the 2025 prediction? That becomes $642 – a 71% return on your initial investment, just by holding and staking. Mind of Pepe isn’t just a meme – it’s a movement with brains, buzz, and built-in income, emerging right as Pepe aims to flip Shiba Inu and investors hunt for smarter meme coin plays. 3. Codename Pepe ($AGNT) – AI-Powered Trading Intelligence for the Meme Coin Era Codename Pepe ($AGNT) is taking the chaos of crypto markets and turning it into a clear, data-driven strategy. At the heart of Codename Pepe is its flagship utility token, $AGNT, which unlocks access to exclusive predictive analytics, market insights, governance, and staking rewards. What sets Codename Pepe apart is its AI agent, trained to monitor everything from on-chain activity to trending memes and sentiment across social media. It doesn’t just collect data – it interprets it and translates it into actionable trading signals. Whether it’s detecting early momentum for an obscure altcoin or sniffing out whale wallet movements before a major pump, Codename Pepe delivers an edge for those who want to stay ahead of the curve. The project has already raised $2.3M in its presale, and the token is priced at $0.111111. This early traction shows serious interest in AI-driven tools that go beyond hype and speculation. And as more retail traders look for smarter ways to play the market, Codename Pepe is positioning itself as the ultimate tool for navigating the meme coin battlefield. In a market where meme coins are battling for dominance and the dollar’s future looks shaky, $AGNT might just be your secret weapon. As the Dollar Wobbles, Altcoins Step Up With growing fears around the U.S. dollar’s long-term dominance and meme coins entering a new phase of evolution, crypto is becoming more than just a speculative play – it’s becoming a strategic hedge. New crypto projects like Solaxy , Mind of Pepe , and Codename Pepe are leading the charge, offering utility, innovation, and timely relevance in a shifting global landscape. Whether you’re chasing DeFi gains, meme coin momentum, or AI-powered edge, these are some of the best altcoins to watch right now.

2025-06-01T10:31:11,"Crypto users lost $244M to scammers in May, down 40% from April: PeckShield","Crypto scammers made away with about $244 million in the month of May, a new PeckShield report has shown. According to the report, the stolen amount dropped drastically from April stats, with the largest incident making up 90% of the month’s total. According to a post by PeckShield on X, the blockchain security firm mentioned that the crypto industry recorded about 20 hacks, pushing the total amount lost to $244.1 million. “In May 2025, ~20 major crypto hacks were recorded, resulting in total losses of $244.1M — a 39.29% decrease from April,” PeckShied said. The decline comes as the crypto industry has been putting measures in place and stepping up efforts to combat these activities. Funds from the Cetus DEX hack frozen According to the blockchain security firm, the biggest hack that occurred last month happened on the Cetus decentralized exchange. The platform suffered a breach on May 22, resulting in the loss of about $223 million in users’ funds. The incident was reported by pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3, who posted on X that the Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited. According to blockchain security firm Dedaub, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MBS) check. #PeckShieldAlert In May 2025, ~20 major crypto hacks were recorded, resulting in total losses of $244.1M—a 39.29% decrease from April. Notably, @CetusProtocol & #SUI have frozen a combined $157M of stolen funds (representing 71% recovery from the $220M theft). #Top 5 Hacks in… pic.twitter.com/ZJmGZvbthS — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) June 1, 2025 The firm mentioned that the exploit allowed the threat actors to manipulate values for the liquidity parameters by orders of magnitude. It then allowed them to establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. “This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens,” the blockchain security firm said in its report. PeckShield added that Cetus and the Sui Network had frozen about $157 million in stolen funds, which represents about 71% of the entire cache. PeckShield noted that the second-largest exploit of May was the attack on the decentralized finance platform Cork Protocol . According to cybersecurity firm Cyvers, the Cork Protocol hacker used the exploit to cart away about 3,761 Wrapped States Ether (wstETH), which they converted to Ethereum. The last three of the top five hacks for the month were an MBU tokens exploit worth $2.2 million, a MapleStory Universe exploit of $1.2 million, and an attack suspected to be linked to the DPRK, worth $5.2 million. Industry steps up the war against crypto hackers The PeckShield report comes after increased efforts by the crypto industry to protect itself against bad actors. According to previous reports, the security team of crypto exchange BitMEX released a report where it mentioned that it discovered gaps in the operational security of the Lazarus group, a North Korean cybercrime group that is alleged to have ties to the government of the country. During the counter operations probe into the organization, the platform discovered IP addresses, a database, and tracking algorithms deployed by the group. According to some of the security researchers, there is a likelihood that one of the hackers in the group accidentally revealed his true IP address, which they said showed the actual location of the hacker to be in Jiaxing, China. The researchers also said they were also able to access a Supabase database, a platform for easily deploying databases with simple interfaces for applications, used by the hacking group. According to PeckShield, the crypto industry lost over $1.63 billion to hackers, with the blockchain security platform pointing out that the Bybit exploit accounted for more than 92% of the entire loss. The firm also pointed out that over $487 million in crypto was lost to hackers in January, while February saw a jump to $1.53 billion due to the Bybit incident, which has been dubbed the largest crypto heist to date.

2025-06-01T10:10:35,"SEC Challenges ETF Status of Proposed Staked Solana and Ether Funds","Key Takeaways: The SEC has questioned the structure of proposed staked Solana and Ether ETFs. The agency flagged the C-corp structure as conflicting with ETF regulations. Final decisions on staking ETFs are likely delayed until October. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised concerns about the structure of proposed Solana (SOL) and Ether (ETH) staked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), arguing that the products may not qualify as ETFs under current regulations. ETF provider REX Financial and asset manager Osprey Funds recently submitted amendments for the funds’ registration. However, according to Bloomberg, the SEC flagged the use of a c-corporation (c-corp) structure, a rare choice for ETFs, as conflicting with Rule 6C-11, commonly referred to as the “ETF rule,” which defines permitted fund structures. SEC Flags Compliance Issues in Proposed ETF Structures The SEC staff said they continue to have unresolved questions about whether the proposed funds, if structured and operated as planned, meet the definition of an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act, according to a letter dated May 30. The letter further warned that disclosures about the funds’ investment company status “may be potentially misleading.” Despite the regulatory pushback, analysts remain hopeful. “REX lawyers say they can work it out,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a May 31 post on X. “Issuers are pushing the envelope hard in an effort to get first to market.” Update: SEC sent letter to REX last night saying it was concerned SEC improperly filed. REX lawyer says they can work it out. Feels a bit like the $PRIV situation. Issuers pushing envelope hard in effort to get first to mkt. Saturday scoop from @isabelletanlee https://t.co/6fnYf5Oo2V pic.twitter.com/NHTvOQyDsO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 31, 2025 Market participants are closely tracking the progress of altcoin and staking-based ETFs, viewing them as a potential gateway for fresh institutional capital to enter the crypto sector. The SEC’s caution comes even after it clarified earlier this year that crypto staking, in itself, does not constitute a securities transaction. Still, the agency has delayed rulings on several staking and altcoin ETF applications. These delays are not unexpected. “Almost all of these filings have final due dates in October,” Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart wrote. “It is uncommon for ETF applications to be approved so early.” BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Sees Record $430M Outflows As reported, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded $430.8 million in outflows on May 30, ending a 31-day inflow streak — its longest since launch. The move marks IBIT’s largest single-day outflow to date, according to Farside data, following a month where BlackRock added $6.2 billion in Bitcoin. Despite the pullback, IBIT’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at around $70 billion. The outflows were part of a broader trend across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $616.1 million in net redemptions on May 30 — the second consecutive day of outflows. The previous day had seen $346.8 million withdrawn. Notably, BlackRock was the only issuer to post inflows on May 29, even as others saw redemptions.

2025-06-01T10:00:28,"Bitcoin Still Bullish, But $200,000 Off The Table And $137,000 In Sight","Bitcoin’s price action has drawn a sharp dividing line between long-term bullish expectations and short-term reality. After peaking above $111,000 in May, the Bitcoin price has entered a retracement phase and is now trading below $105,000. While some interpret the current downturn as a sign of a weakening trend, others see it as a textbook bullish correction. Among them is crypto analyst MasterAnanda, whose latest chart suggests that Bitcoin is structurally strong enough to reach new highs, but it might fall short of the speculated $200,000 price target this cycle. Related Reading: No Room For Doubt: Analyst’s $900K Bitcoin Forecast Follows Familiar Script MasterAnanda Predicts Higher Low And $137,000 Target In his TradingView post, MasterAnanda stated clearly that Bitcoin is still in a bullish structure, but he believes a $200,000 peak is out of reach for this cycle. Instead, he identified $137,000 as the more realistic upside target when Bitcoin finally rebounds from the ongoing correction. According to the analyst, the formation of a higher low on the larger time frame will be an important confirmation that Bitcoin’s macro uptrend remains intact. He outlined $88,888.88 as an ideal retracement level to make this perfect higher low, because it aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level and comes in well above the prior bottom at $74,500 on April 7. Despite the current sell-off, MasterAnanda argues that the broader trend is healthy. “Bitcoin will never ever trade below $80,000 in its history again,” he declared, ruling out any deep reversal below the prior low. On the other hand, the analyst also noted that if Bitcoin holds above $100,000 to $102,000, this retracement would be considered minor, with price action still classified as bullish continuation rather than a breakdown. If Bitcoin bulls manage to keep prices trading above that area, it would suggest the current move is nothing more than a short-term dip. When that moment arrives, the bias will shift from short to long, and a rally to $137,000. However, a clean break below the $100,000 price level would mark a significant shift in how long Bitcoin reaches new highs. Chart From TradingView: MasterAnanda RLinda Echoes $101,000 Support For Bitcoin Adding to the analysis, another trader, RLinda, shared a 4-hour chart perspective showing how Bitcoin is currently in a fragile recovery path. She agrees that Bitcoin is still operating within a bullish context, but flagged the $102,000 and $101,400 zones as vital structural supports. Her chart suggests that the false breakout at the key $110,000 resistance level is the end of the recent rally leg, and the current decline could be a liquidity-driven correction rather than a complete reversal of the bullish trend. Furthermore, RLinda’s analysis shows that Bitcoin has exited its upward channel. The outcome, she said, will depend heavily on whether support levels at $102,000 and $101,400 can hold. A bounce from these levels could lead to a retest of the $106,000 to $108,000 resistance zone, where market direction may become clearer. If bulls fail to hold $101,000, it could invite a more dramatic sell-off that pushes the Bitcoin price toward a local bottom or even deeper.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah says 41-year-old Kyle Eugene Duncan-Carle has been sentenced to 72 months in prison after he admitted to committing bank fraud. Authorities say that between January and September 2023, Duncan-Carle stole US Treasury checks that were already made out to people or companies and stole their identities to open credit union accounts under their names. He subsequently deposited the checks to be able to withdraw the funds, according to prosecutors. All in all, Duncan-Carle admitted to stealing at least eight Treasury checks totaling $7.97 million. In the end, authorities say the victims, which include the US government, financial institutions and an insurance provider, sustained $3.49 million in losses. Duncan-Carle’s sentence also includes five years of supervised release after his six-year stint behind bars and an order to pay restitution to his victims. He was reportedly arrested in Lyon County, Nevada, last year and charged with bank fraud, aggravated identity theft and receipt of stolen government property.

2025-06-01T09:07:07,"Smart contracts need community intelligence | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. The most promising protocols in crypto today aren’t just algorithmic marvels. They’re designed to harness the collective intelligence of their communities. Having managed both a 5,000-acre vegetable farm and multiple crypto ventures, I’ve watched purely technical approaches consistently fail where community-integrated systems thrive. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion In northern Italy, truffle hunters work in perfect synergy with their trained pigs. The pigs detect valuable truffles through their acute sense of smell, sensing compounds humans cannot perceive. The hunters contribute expertise in identifying promising locations, interpreting signals, and extracting truffles without damage. Neither succeeds alone. This complementary intelligence offers a powerful lesson for crypto protocols. Many are still trying to replace human judgment with algorithms when they should be creating systems that combine both. Protocols that listen outperform Look at Yearn Finance. It didn’t revolutionize DeFi through better algorithms. It created a system that actively integrates community signals into its vault strategies. When unsustainable yield farms emerged during the 2021-2022 DeFi boom, Yearn’s community detected the risks months before they became obvious. The protocol amplified this intelligence, outperforming purely algorithmic approaches. Similarly, Aave’s risk management framework incorporates ongoing community governance to adjust parameters based on subtle market shifts that quantitative models miss. This integration helped Aave weather market turbulence that destroyed less adaptive protocols. The evidence is compelling. During the 2024 election, while traditional polls showed 15-point swings between candidates, prediction markets maintained signals accurate to within two percentage points. When people put actual money behind their predictions, they consistently outperform expert analysis. In protocol performance, the pattern is unmistakable. During the cascading liquidations of 2023, protocols with community-integrated risk systems experienced significantly fewer insolvencies than those relying solely on algorithms ( Gauntlet, 2023 ). Aave, for example, weathered the March 2023 USD Coin ( USDC ) crisis with only minimal bad debt, while algorithmic protocols faced cascading failures ( Chaos Labs, 2023 ). Meanwhile, protocols with active governance, like MakerDAO and Yearn Finance, delivered significantly higher risk-adjusted returns from 2020 to 2024 ( ChainCatcher, 2024 ). I’ve seen this dynamic throughout my years growing up in and around agriculture. The most resilient farming communities don’t just follow models. They draw on generational, regional knowledge to get the most out of their soil and maximize yield over the long term. They know which rotations actually restore fertility in their specific fields, how to manage nitrogen without over-relying on inputs, and which cover crops make sense given local climate and soil type. This isn’t folklore. It’s research-backed, but grounded in lived experience. Top-down agtech platforms and government policies often miss the mark because they assume one-size-fits-all answers. But soil doesn’t work that way. Neither does making a living from it. The knowledge that matters most lives in communities, passed down, adapted each season, and tested over time. Behavioral finance confirms what’s obvious to experienced market participants: algorithms excel in stable environments but falter when fundamental conditions shift. Like a truffle pig trained to find black truffles suddenly hunting white ones, these systems can only detect what they’re programmed to find. Designing for complementary intelligence Creating effective partnerships between algorithms and communities requires intentional design. The most successful protocols incorporate these principles: Transparent observability : Community participants need visibility into system operations. Dashboards, real-time metrics, and clear documentation enable the community to develop pattern recognition capabilities that algorithms might miss. Graduated response mechanisms : Rather than binary on/off switches, effective protocols provide a spectrum of intervention options. Uniswap’s three-tiered fee structure exemplifies this approach, allowing community wisdom to find the right balance for different trading pairs. Sentiment aggregation systems : Beyond formal governance votes, successful protocols capture continuous feedback through multiple channels: forums, Discord discussions, GitHub issues, on-chain behavior. These inputs form an ongoing conversation between code and community. Failure planning : The most resilient systems assume algorithmic failures will occur and design community response systems in advance. These “break glass in case of emergency” mechanisms acknowledge that human judgment becomes most valuable precisely when automated systems reach their limits. By designing with these principles, protocols create space for complementary intelligence to flourish. Algorithms handle routine operations with efficiency while community wisdom addresses complex edge cases and strategic decisions. Finding your edge as an investor For investors, the implications are clear: protocols designed to harness community intelligence offer more sustainable returns. Look for projects that: Integrate governance beyond token voting, capturing community insights continuously. Look for protocols with active forums, responsive Discord channels, and teams that engage meaningfully with user feedback outside of formal governance processes. Demonstrate adaptive strategy shifts based on community signals. Review how the protocol responded to previous market stress events. The best projects show a pattern of preemptive adjustments based on community discussions before problems become obvious to the broader market. Prioritize ecosystem health over maximum short-term yields. This typically appears as conservative risk parameters and sustainable growth rates. Examine how the team handled previous yield opportunities—did they chase maximum returns or maintain prudent safety margins? The most valuable protocols don’t replace human judgment with algorithms. They build systems that combine community wisdom with technical precision, just like the centuries-old partnership between truffle hunter and pig. When millions are at stake, would you trust only the algorithm, or would you prefer a protocol that incorporates the collective wisdom of thousands of engaged participants?

2025-06-01T09:06:00,"BitMEX Uncovers Security Flaws in North Korea’s Lazarus Group Operations","Key Takeaways: BitMEX uncovered major security flaws in North Korea’s Lazarus Group. A rare IP leak exposed a hacker’s location in China. G7 leaders plan to address North Korea’s growing crypto thefts at their upcoming summit. BitMEX’s security team has exposed significant operational weaknesses within the Lazarus Group, the North Korean state-sponsored cybercrime network responsible for a string of high-profile crypto hacks. In a recent counter-operations probe , BitMEX researchers identified technical missteps that revealed parts of the group’s infrastructure. Among the discoveries were exposed IP addresses, an accessible database, and tracking algorithms used by the group in its campaigns. Rare Slip Exposes Lazarus Hacker’s IP Address in China One key finding suggests that a hacker likely exposed his real IP address during an operation, pinpointing a location in Jiaxing, China — a rare lapse for the highly secretive group. Researchers also gained access to a Supabase database instance used by the attackers. Supabase is a platform that simplifies database deployment, and its use by Lazarus highlights the group’s evolving operational tools. BitMEX’s report underscores a growing divide in the group’s internal structure. It notes an “asymmetry” between low-skill social engineering teams, responsible for tricking users into downloading malware, and the more advanced developers creating sophisticated exploits. The fragmentation suggests that Lazarus has splintered into sub-groups with varying capabilities. While some cells rely on basic social engineering, others deploy complex technical attacks targeting the blockchain and tech sectors. North Korea is funding its weapons program with cryptocurrency stolen through cyberattacks. Hackers stole more than $50 million from at least three cryptocurrency exchanges between 2020 and mid-2021, according to a U.N. report https://t.co/EkLEJwPjdj pic.twitter.com/edPXkjsaV3 — Reuters (@Reuters) February 8, 2022 The findings come amid a wider surge in DPRK-linked cyber activity. Global law enforcement agencies continue to investigate the group’s operations. In September 2024, the FBI warned about phishing scams using fake job offers to lure crypto users. That warning was later echoed by Japan, South Korea, and U.S. officials, who labeled Lazarus a threat to financial stability. Now, international concern is growing. A Bloomberg report suggests world leaders may address the Lazarus threat at the upcoming G7 Summit, exploring coordinated strategies to mitigate damage from the group’s activities. With Lazarus remaining an active force in the crypto threat landscape, BitMEX’s findings offer new insights into the group’s operational vulnerabilities — and potential avenues for disruption. G7 to Address North Korea’s Crypto Theft Surge G7 leaders are expected to address North Korea’s escalating cyberattacks and cryptocurrency thefts at next month’s summit in Canada. While global conflicts remain high on the agenda, Pyongyang’s cyber operations, seen as a key funding source for its weapons programs, are drawing urgent attention from member states seeking coordinated action. The Lazarus Group, North Korea’s most infamous hacking collective, is believed to be behind a series of major crypto thefts, including a record $1.4 billion heist from exchange Bybit in February. Chainalysis has claimed that North Korean-linked actors stole over $1.3 billion across 47 separate incidents in 2024 alone. Beyond external hacks, the regime employs rogue IT workers to infiltrate crypto firms from within — a tactic flagged in a joint warning from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. North Korean cyber strategies continue to evolve. In April, Lazarus-linked operatives reportedly set up U.S.-based shell companies to distribute malware to crypto developers. Kraken recently thwarted an infiltration attempt by a suspected North Korean posing as a job candidate.

2025-06-01T09:00:00,"Mogul Club, Ava Labs partner to bring tokenized real estate to web3 investors","As blockchain technology continues to reshape global finance, a new frontier is emerging: tokenized real estate. Mogul Club (stylized as mogul Club)—a platform founded by former Goldman Sachs real estate professionals—is taking a bold step in that direction with the launch of Clubs, on-chain, community-powered investment groups designed to democratize access to premium, income-generating properties. One of the first major collaborations? A partnership with Ava Labs to launch the Avalanche Club, a real estate syndication initiative built for the Web3 community. Through this alliance, developers and users in the Avalanche ecosystem can now pool resources and invest in institutional-grade properties using stablecoins and digital assets—no intermediaries required. To understand how the startup is turning tokenized real estate from concept to execution, crypto.news caught up with co-founder Alex Blackwood. Alex Blackwood, co-founder of mogul Club What was the original vision behind mogul Club, and how has it evolved with the introduction of Clubs? Our original vision behind mogul Club was to democratize premium real estate, traditionally one of the most powerful vehicles for long-term wealth creation, through fractional ownership. Historically, access to institutional-grade property deals has been limited due to high capital minimums, exclusive networks, and knowledge barriers. We aimed to dismantle these barriers by enabling everyday investors and high-net-worth individuals alike to invest fractionally in professionally managed, cash-flowing blue-chip properties. With the introduction of Clubs, our vision has expanded from individual access to fostering community-powered investing. Now, groups such as friends, families, alumni networks, and others can learn and earn together while investing in real estate. Clubs bring a collaborative, social dimension to mogul, empowering communities to build wealth collectively and intentionally. What problems are you solving that traditional platforms don’t address? Clubs represent a fundamental reimagining of the traditional real estate investing model, tailored specifically for a digitally native and community-oriented generation. Traditional investing has typically been exclusive, opaque, and reliant on institutional gatekeepers. Clubs reverse this paradigm by creating a transparent, grassroots-driven approach powered by shared values and collective goals. mogul aims to lead community-led capital formation by allowing groups such as crypto ecosystems, alumni networks, and others to form or join Clubs aligned with their specific interests. Additionally, as Clubs evolve, we are developing premium, customized features designed to meet the investing needs of community organizers and participants. What’s your revenue model? Mogul currently collects revenue through fees structured around our fractional investments. We have a 3% onboarding fee and a 2% setup fee, both capitalized into the deal based on the purchase price of the property. These fees cover expenses related to finding, vetting, and onboarding properties. Additionally, we collect 2.5% of the rental income to manage coordination with property managers and to leverage institutional-level discounts. Importantly, this 2.5% minimally impacts returns and aligns our incentives closely with investors—we do not collect this fee unless investors receive returns. All returns projected on our platform, including IRR estimates, are presented net of these fees. How do you ensure liquidity for investors in tokenized real estate assets? Mogul plans to introduce secondary liquidity options by Q2 2026. Until then, investor liquidity primarily occurs when properties are sold. In the interim, investors benefit from real-time appreciation of their investment, monthly dividends distributed directly to their account, and tax benefits. Are there any regulatory safeguards in place, particularly around tokenized securities? Mogul operates as an investment club and not as a regulated security, so traditional securities regulations do not apply. We implement robust Know Your Customer (KYC) processes to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to identity verification and anti-money laundering. Additionally, our platform is built on Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain technology, using Snowtrace for transparency, and we utilize Fireblocks to securely store users’ wallets and keys. Fireblocks employ stringent security protocols and measures, including secure custody and robust key management, to protect digital assets and ensure their safe transfer and storage. Crucially, investors’ capital is placed directly into the property-owning PropCo LLCs, which means their investments are fully protected even if mogul were to experience operational disruptions.

2025-06-01T08:30:47,"$202 Million In Long Liquidations Rock Bitcoin Market — What’s Next For BTC Price?","Over the weekend, Bitcoin’s price extended its disappointing performance, falling to around $103,000 in the early hours of Saturday, May 31st. While the premier cryptocurrency seems to have recovered fine in the past day, its price is still more than 6% away from the recently achieved all-time high of $111,814. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin price could resume its upward trajectory anytime from now. Mass Long Liquidations Could Mean Sustained Upward Trend For BTC In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci shared that the Bitcoin market witnessed its third-largest long liquidation in the month of May. Data from CryptoQuant shows that $202 million in BTC long positions were liquidated on the Binance derivatives exchange on Friday, May 30th. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Price Doomed For $93K? Technical Indicators Paint A Bearish Image As highlighted by Kesmeci, leveraged trading and speculative pressure ramped up on the world’s largest crypto exchange as the price of Bitcoin rallied from around $94,000 to a new record high above $111,000. These long liquidations typically occur when derivatives traders are forced to close their positions as prices move sharply against them, leading to automatic sell-offs that can further trigger volatility in both directions. The latest event — involving $202 million worth of BTC long positions — is the third-largest in the past month, trailing only two larger liquidations in May: $211 million on May 12 and $277 million on May 23. This series of high-value liquidations reflects the increased speculative activity in the Bitcoin market over the past few weeks. While the investors who suffered this liquidation may feel hard done by the market, these mass liquidations could be positive for the flagship cryptocurrency — a healthy reset for what is starting to feel like an overheated market. By removing excessive leverage, the Bitcoin market can reestablish a more stable foundation for price discovery and a continued upward trend. Bitcoin Funding Rates Still Very Low: Analyst According to another on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost, the Bitcoin funding rates are still at extremely low levels. This trend signals the unwillingness and hesitation of traders to open new long positions, read the post on X. Darkfost added: Typically, when Bitcoin breaks above its previous all-time high, we tend to see a surge in funding rates, signaling that euphoria and risk appetite are back. But that’s not what we’re seeing right now, investors need more clarity before jumping in with conviction. The on-chain analyst stated that this cautious stance of investors could be positive for the Bitcoin price and the upward trend. Moreover, the lack of euphoria reflects a market that is yet to be overheated, with room for further upside growth. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $ 104,897, reflecting a mere 0.2% increase in the past 24 hours.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $104,896 before declining to current levels. BTC has been up almost 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $104,612, as it looks to build momentum and push above $105,000. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy Is Gaining Steam Michael Saylor’s Strategy’s Bitcoin accumulation plan is being copied by media firms, multinational conglomerates, and meme stock companies. However, Wall Street remains skeptical and isn’t buying into the hype. This week, Trump Media announced an ambitious plan to raise $2.5 billion to fund Bitcoin purchases. GameStop also made a $500 million allocation towards Bitcoin purchases, while Tether, Softbank, and Strike’s Jack Mallers announced TwentyOne, a Bitcoin-native public company. The company plans to launch with more than 42,000 BTC on its balance sheet. However, the market doesn’t see any of the firms becoming the next Strategy. Trump Media shares plunged 20% since the announcement, while GameStop is down 17%. Speaking about the market’s reaction to the announcements, Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor stated, “Maybe the market wanted them to buy more bitcoin. But these are short-term dynamics. Over the long term, bitcoin on the balance sheet has proven to be extraordinarily popular.” Saylor called Trump Media’s move aggressive and intelligent, stating, “Everywhere I go at this conference, someone says, you know, I’m working on a bitcoin treasury company in Hong Kong. I’m doing this thing in Korea. I’ve got this thing I’m working on in Abu Dhabi. We’re going to do this in the Middle East, you know, we’ve got this in the U.K.There’s an explosion of interest right now.” IMF Flags Concerns About Pakistan’s Bitcoin Plan The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The plans were announced last week amid ongoing negotiations with the IMF to extend the country’s financial program. However, the IMF has questioned the move and requested urgent clarification from the country’s Finance Ministry regarding the legality of crypto mining and power allocations as the country struggles with chronic energy shortages and fiscal pressures. According to reports, the IMF was not consulted prior to the announcement, prompting it to question the legal standing of cryptocurrencies in Pakistan. It has also voiced concerns over potential impacts on resource distribution and power tariffs. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative. The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the talks.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) continued its decline from recent highs, dipping below $105,000 as sellers gained the upper hand in recent sessions. Analysts predict a deeper pullback to $100,000 will occur before bulls find the momentum to return to the price discovery phase. The flagship cryptocurrency is almost $8,000 below its peak of $111,970. As BTC encountered resistance at multiple levels, on-chain indicators flagged a slowdown in momentum. On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant noted in a report that some Bitcoin demand metrics were reaching a short-term top, indicating a pause in the current rally. The report stated, “CryptoQuant’s estimate of Bitcoin’s demand growth in the last 30 days is at 229K, which is near the previous demand growth top of 279K Bitcoin reached in December 2024. Additionally, whale-held Bitcoin balances have increased by 2.8% over the past month, a pace that often precedes a slowdown in whale accumulation.” Bitcoin (BTC) raced to a new all-time high on Thursday (May 22), racing an intraday high of $111,970 before settling at $111,589. However, it has been downhill since, with the price nearly 4% to $107,356. BTC recovered over the weekend, registering an increase of 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to settle at $109,103. The price registered a marginal increase on Monday but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% and settling at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell .03% and settled at $107,834. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. BTC continued to decline on Friday, falling 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Saturday, rising 0.69% to $104,784. The current session sees BTC marginally down. The MACD shows sellers have the upper hand. If the current downtrend continues, BTC could test the $100,000 support level before bouncing back. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-01T07:57:35,"Bitcoin Analyst Sets $8 to $10 XRP Price. Here’s the Timeline","George Tung, founder of the crypto-focused platform CryptosRUs and a recognized analyst in the Bitcoin space, has recently voiced his expectations for XRP’s future performance. Speaking with Altcoin Daily, Tung stated that XRP could realistically rise to a price between $8 and $10 by the end of 2025. This prediction, which he described as a conservative estimate, is based on the digital asset’s market durability and the increasing involvement of institutional investors. Institutional Growth and Market Trends Tung’s outlook hinges on the belief that XRP is well-positioned to benefit from a broader trend of increased institutional engagement with digital assets. During the interview, he said that recent filings for XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be a catalyst for significant growth. According to him, if any of these products receive approval, they could channel considerable capital into XRP, thereby placing upward pressure on the token’s price. XRP has won the trust of many institutions , and these products could cement its status as highly attractive to institutions. Aaron Arnold, the host, noted that XRP has maintained relevance through multiple shifts in the crypto market. Tung believes this resilience distinguishes it from highly speculative tokens, making it a better option for those who want long-term exposure to digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 High Expectations for XRP in the Current Cycle While discussing other leading cryptocurrencies, Tung made it clear that XRP can outperform the others. He believes Bitcoin could see a 1.5x to 2x increase from current levels, while Ethereum may achieve a 3x to 4x return. However, he expects XRP to deliver up to 5x its current value under favorable market conditions. This suggests a target range of $8.76 to $10.95 based on the asset’s current price of $2.19. Tung also noted that established assets, such as XRP, will benefit from improved market sentiment and a return of capital to altcoins. His broader forecast for the cycle includes a Bitcoin peak between $200,000 and $300,000. In early 2024, veteran trader Peter Brandt predicted that BTC could hit $200,000 by Q3 of 2025 , and this move would set a strong backdrop for gains across the market. Caution on Unrealistic Expectations Tung also warned retail investors against chasing extreme short-term gains, noting that meme coin success is rare despite notable surges of meme coins like PEPE. He urged a disciplined strategy and focus on credible projects with long-term utility. Even former skeptics like Davinci Jeremie now see potential in XRP, with Jeremie suggesting it could hit $24 this year , and Tung advised beginners to allocate most of their funds to fundamentally strong projects.

2025-06-01T07:54:02,"Saylor wants to be on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast","Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor has publicly mentioned that he intends to discuss Bitcoin on one of the most listened-to podcasts in the world, The Joe Rogan Experience. The Strategy man made his intentions known on X after a fan account on the show posed the question. Michael Saylor has been a long-time proponent of Bitcoin, willing to talk about the leading digital asset with anyone who cares to listen. Even at times when it seemed like the world wasn’t listening, he continued to talk about Bitcoin. His company, Strategy has also been committed to their goal of owning more Bitcoin than any other person in the world, with a recent purchase of 4,020 BTC, worth $427 million. The firm has signaled its intention to own more, noting that it will continue to raise capital to purchase more BTC in the future if it needs to. Taking to his X handle, Saylor shot his shot toward the podcast host. “Hey @joerogan, let’s talk about Bitcoin,” Saylor said in a May 31 X post in response to a Joe Rogan fan account asking, “Who’s one guest you’d love to see Joe Rogan interview that he hasn’t had on yet?” Michael Saylor triggers community excitement with his post Saylor’s post seemed to have pumped up the Bitcoin community, with high-profile members of the community praising the move. Crypto analyst Kook told their over 164,000 followers that “Saylor is going to Bitcoin pill Joe Rogan.” While addressing the concerns of a member who mentioned that Joe Rogan might not understand Bitcoin, he said, after a second or third conversation, he expects Rogan to become a massive advocate of the token. Another crypto commentator Brandon McDougal also mentioned that he will be watching his first-ever Joe Rogan podcast if he manages to invite Saylor to the show. Meanwhile, Rogan has frequently talked about crypto and Bitcoin on his podcast, but this might be the first significant shift considering the fact that Saylor has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the sector. Aside from making pro-Bitcoin statements over the years, Rogan mentioned in an episode with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in October 2023 that out of all the digital assets that exist in the market, Bitcoin fascinates him the most. “The real fascinating crypto is Bitcoin. That’s the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency. It’s limited in the amount that it can be,” Rogan said at the time. He added that it fascinates him, saying, “I love the fact that it’s been implemented.” While Joe Rogan has yet to respond publicly to Saylor’s post about coming on the show, there is a likelihood that both of them could discuss a potential appearance on the show in the coming days. Meanwhile, this is not the first time that a personality with a wealth of experience in the Bitcoin community will be making an appearance on the show, with Rogan inviting Bitcoin entrepreneur Andreas Antonopoulos. Antonopoulos made his appearance on the show around 2014 to 2016 when Bitcoin was still eyeing a move above $1,000. Meanwhile, Saylor’s firm has been holding strong in the Bitcoin race, with Strategy now holding up to about 580,250 BTC, worth $60.56 billion according to the Saylor Tracker website . He also recently discussed why Bitcoin is yet to touch close to the $150,000 price mark. He mentioned that holders who do not plan to hold the asset long-term have been selling off their holdings while new investors are currently flooding the market. “I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.

In a chart shared on X, he identifies two symmetrical triangle formations and describes XRP’s next moves as “fantastic.” The first occurred before XRP’s major move last November, and another is currently unfolding, suggesting a repeat of XRP’s performance in November. The next move for #XRP will be fantastic! pic.twitter.com/V8mKAUWsub — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 31, 2025 The First Symmetrical Triangle The previous triangle formed between July and October 2024. XRP spent much of this time consolidating between $0.5 and $0.6 without any sustained breakouts. However, the tables turned when Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. Gary Gensler, the former Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced his resignation shortly after, ending the war against cryptocurrencies. The excitement from these developments ignited a market-wide resurgence. Bitcoin rose above $100,000 for the first time, and XRP broke through notable resistance levels despite the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Surged over 500% to $3.39. XRP’s Current Symmetrical Triangle Steph’s current analysis suggests that the structure of the ongoing consolidation bears a close resemblance to that earlier setup. The implication is that another breakout of comparable magnitude could occur if XRP decisively breaks the current resistance line. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The new symmetrical triangle pattern , shown on a 3-day Heikin Ashi chart, indicates consolidation between support at around $1.90 and resistance just below $2.70. The similarity between the two patterns could signal an imminent move. XRP is currently trading at $2.18, and if it experiences another 500% surge like it did in November, it could climb to a new all-time high of $13.08. Experts have set targets around $15 for the current market cycle, and Steph’s analysis reaffirms these double-digit targets. Whale Activity Reinforces Bullish Expectations Adding to the bullish excitement, a whale recently opened a $1.08 million long position using 12x leverage at an entry price of $2.1336. This shows confidence in the digital asset’s future and suggests whales may be preparing for something big. This combination of positive factors, including the symmetrical triangles, historical similarity, and significant whale positioning, has led many in the community to anticipate a powerful breakout. If XRP can replicate its previous pattern, the coming weeks could deliver explosive price action that mirrors or even exceeds the rally seen in late 2024.

However, it started to retrace on the next day when US President Trump outlined a new tariff recommendation against the EU and the asset slumped by several grand to around $107,000. It bounced off at the start of the business week and tapped $110,000. However, another rejection followed at that point, and BTC was pushed down to the $107,000 level once again. The situation worsened as the week progressed and BTC slipped to $105,000 on Friday after Trump blamed China that it had violated the previous trade agreement between the two. Saturday saw another leg down as bitcoin slumped to a 12-day low of $103,000. It has recovered some ground and is above $104,000 now, but it’s still over 3% down on the week. Its market cap has calmed at $2.070 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is well above 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView CRO Defies Market-Wide Trend Most altcoins have posted big losses over the past seven days. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu lead the pack, with massive declines of 15% and 12.6%, respectively. Solana, SUI, and LINK follow suit, with price drops of around 10%. ETH has managed to maintain the $2,500 level, while XRP is down to $2.16 after a 6.7% weekly slump. Further losses are evident from PI, XMR, and PEPE, while CRO has defied the market-wide trend. Cronos’ native token has jumped by 7.5% since last Sunday and sits well above $0.1. The total crypto market cap has dropped by over $250 billion since last week and is below $3.4 trillion on CG now.

In a new interview with CNBC at the Reagan National Economic Forum, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says the US government is having internal problems with the management of its finances. Dimon says that unless the government gets its act together, the country risks losing its status as a military and economic superpower. “The amount of mismanagement is extraordinary. By state, by city, for pensions – that stuff is going to kill us. I always get asked this question: ‘Are we going to be the reserve currency?’ No. If we are not the preeminent military and the preeminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency. That’s a fact, just read history.” Dimon calls on the US government to act with a sense of urgency and fix its internal issues if the country is to remain the largest economy in the world. “Now, I think we will be [on top]. Warren Buffett will tell you that we’re normally resilient, and I agree with that, [but] I think this time is different.

2025-06-01T07:01:14,"The SEC raises legal red flags over staking ETFs","The SEC is raising legal red flags over two proposed crypto ETFs tied to staking rewards, both of which had just cleared initial registration steps. The challenge came Friday evening when the Securities and Exchange Commission told ETF Opportunities Trust — the entity responsible for registering funds managed by REX Financial and Osprey Funds — that the new Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs may not qualify as legal investment companies under federal law. This call into question their ability to list on public markets. Both ETFs aim to give investors access to staking yields by tracking Ethereum and Solana, while also passing staking income back to shareholders. But the SEC said the filings were “improperly filed” and warned that the registration documents might be “potentially misleading” about the funds’ legal status. The funds had claimed they met the definition of an investment company, but the SEC says that’s not a given. In a formal letter sent on Saturday, the Commission said it might take further steps “to ensure compliance with the federal securities laws” if the situation is not resolved. While the funds had technically received effective registration earlier on Friday, meaning they could have gone live at any time, that launch is now stalled. SEC flags ETF structure and staking disclosures Greg Collett, general counsel at REX Financial, said the firm isn’t backing away. “We think we can satisfy the SEC on the investment company question, and we don’t intend to launch the funds until we do that.” REX had hoped to get the products trading by mid-June, according to Greg King, the firm’s founder. Now, everything is paused until the SEC gives a clear go-ahead. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said the Commission’s objection may be specific to the filing strategy REX used. “Even if the SEC doesn’t allow this structure to list, we still believe the more straightforward attempts to allow staking in a US ETF will ultimately be successful,” he said. “It’s a matter of when, not if. But the SEC doesn’t seem to be a fan of the way Rex tried to push these listings through.” This is the second time in just a few months that the SEC has stepped in after a fund tried to go public with a structure it didn’t like. In March, the agency publicly pushed back on a private credit ETF managed by State Street Corp. and Apollo Global Management — the first of its kind — only hours after it listed. That product had to deal with similar regulatory issues around classification. The new staking ETFs attempt to blend traditional investment products with crypto-native features like yield from validating transactions. But the SEC doesn’t consider staking returns to be straightforward income, and is clearly uncomfortable with listing a product that generates money in a way they don’t fully regulate. The legal uncertainty around staking continues to block more complex crypto offerings. Bitcoin ETFs attract billions while gold-backed funds bleed As the SEC slams the brakes on staking products, Bitcoin ETFs are pulling in serious capital. Over the past five weeks, US Bitcoin ETFs have seen more than $9 billion in inflows, led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). On the flip side, gold ETFs have been bleeding money — losing more than $2.8 billion in the same timeframe. This comes as Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,980 earlier this month. That rally followed positive movement on regulatory issues — especially new momentum around a stablecoin bill — and mounting concern over the United States’ fiscal position under President Donald Trump’s second term. Investors are seeing Bitcoin as a hedge, not just a bet. Even though gold is still up more than 25% for the year, it’s down nearly $190 from recent highs. Some analysts see this shift as long-term. Christopher Wood, global equity strategist at Jefferies, said, “I remain bullish on both gold and Bitcoin. They remain the best hedges on currency debasement in the G7 world.” But others aren’t convinced Bitcoin can be counted on during market stress. Critics point out that during major events — like the August unwinding of the yen carry trade — Bitcoin dropped sharply alongside other risky assets. That kind of volatility continues to make the SEC wary of expanding crypto exposure through mainstream investment products like ETFs.

2025-06-01T06:57:50,"Google Gemini Sets XRP Price for June 30, 2025","As the cryptocurrency market continues its recovery, we’ve checked in with Google Gemini for XRP’s trajectory, looking for a price target for June 30, 2025. XRP has risen over 1.5% from yesterday, and Gemini expects it to continue this climb, predicting a rise from its current price of $2.17 to $3.20 by June 30. According to Gemini, the projected target is based on several key considerations, most notably the current market sentiment, regulatory developments, and adoption. XRP’s Recent Performance Gemini notes that the broader crypto market is in a recovery phase, with Bitcoin leading the trend. XRP has historically moved in line with overall market performance, though often with less intensity. Assuming continued bullish momentum through June, XRP could see notable gains. Gemini’s $3.20 price target represents an increase of more than 47%, and it could set XRP up for further gains. If XRP hits this target, it will be the first time the digital asset has surpassed $3 since its decline in early February . The digital asset experienced a remarkable climb from around $0.55 in November 2024 to $3.39 in January 2025. It took things a step further, closing January above $3—its first monthly close above $3 . However, it has struggled since then. The U.S. economic policies and uncertainty around the lawsuit impacted its performance. Gemini’s prediction suggests the asset’s trajectory is about to turn around, listing some reasons for this bullish outlook. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Contributing to the Bullish Prediction The ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit remains a central factor in XRP’s future valuation. According to Gemini, the decisive end of the lawsuit could create upward momentum for the digital asset. Both parties have agreed to drop their appeals and are working for the approval of their settlement agreement. This agreement involves the removal of the permanent injunction preventing institutional XRP sales and the reduction of Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million. Gemini suggests that the legal clarity from the lawsuit’s conclusion will positively impact investor confidence and price performance. It also highlighted XRP’s role in cross-border payments as a foundational strength, particularly through Ripple’s payment network. As adoption grows , Gemini expects XRP’s price to rise significantly. However, it notes that Ripple will need more high-profile partnerships and central bank integration for long-term growth. While the crypto market is difficult to predict, the outlook remains positive for XRP, with $3.20 representing a realistic short-term target under current market conditions.

2025-06-01T06:05:22,"Missed Bitcoin at $1? Bitcoin Solaris at $5 Is the Closest You’ll Get to a Real Second Shot","The post Missed Bitcoin at $1? Bitcoin Solaris at $5 Is the Closest You’ll Get to a Real Second Shot appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Most investors who passed on Bitcoin early didn’t lack belief — they lacked access, context, or timing. The mechanics were there, but the interface was limited, and the broader market hadn’t caught up. Bitcoin Solaris reintroduces that structure with clearer terms: a locked 21 million supply, no inflation mechanics, and real entry points that don’t rely on speculation or hardware. Phase 5 of the BTC-S presale ends today. The token is priced at 5 USDT, with a supply model that mirrors Bitcoin’s original fixed-cap approach — but deployed on modern infrastructure designed to support mobile mining and rapid scaling from day one. A Supply Model That Doesn’t Move Bitcoin Solaris is permanently capped at 21 million tokens, all hard-coded and locked from future inflation. Of that, 4.2 million were allocated for the entire presale, with all phases published and traceable. No stealth wallets, no emissions model, and no post-launch minting built into the contract. The economics are static — and that’s intentional. With most new chains relying on flexible supply to game rewards or subsidize hype, Bitcoin Solaris is taking the opposite approach. Its value mechanics are front-loaded and locked in — so early access doesn’t just mean lower cost, it means better structural positioning in a closed system. Helios Architecture: The Tech Behind BTC-S Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t run on borrowed infrastructure. It’s built on Helios, a dual-layer blockchain system engineered to scale without the bottlenecks seen in other high-performance chains. At its core is a combination of Proof-of-Stake (PoS)and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), creating a secure and energy-light base for consensus. That foundation is extended by the Solaris Layer — a high-speed validation layer powered by Proof-of-History (PoH)and Proof-of-Time (PoT). This structure enables finality in under two seconds and over 10,000 transactions per second, all while consuming less than 0.05% of the energy used by Bitcoin’s legacy mining system. It’s more than a technical win. It’s what makes mobile mining viable. This system doesn’t rely on hash power — it validates based on committed storage and time. That’s why the Nova App, currently in final pre-launch testing, is able to deliver mining access from standard smartphones with no specialized hardware. Over 11,000 users are already registered for Nova, lining up to enter a network where rewards are tied to action, not asset holding. This is what early Bitcoin looked like — real distribution, real use, and no middleman standing between you and the protocol. Presale Phase 5 Ends Today — So Does This Price At 5 USDT, BTC-S sits far below its projected listing target of 20 USDT. That pricing model isn’t arbitrary — it’s based on liquidity provisioning targets, CEX partner estimates, and the anticipated impact of mobile onboarding at scale. Once listings go live, the entire dynamic shifts. Token acquisition becomes price-driven, and mining returns become more competitive. This phase is the last time entry happens under capped, predictable conditions. The network is about to shift into full operation. Access won’t vanish — but it will get more expensive, and more crowded. BTC-S isn’t being ignored. Several independent analysts have already broken down the structure, architecture, and rollout mechanics — not from hype, but from a technical lens. In a recent breakdown, Crypto Volt walked through Bitcoin Solaris’s consensus model, mobile mining design, and presale economics, calling it “the closest thing to early Bitcoin access since 2013.” Audited, Verified, and Fully Accountable The Bitcoin Solaris ecosystem has passed two full audits. A Cyberscope review confirmed the contract integrity and presale mechanics. A Freshcoins audit tested the Nova App’s mining logic, validating its ability to operate across mobile environments. On top of that, the team has completed KYC verification , giving the project accountability that most presales avoid. These aren’t extras. They’re part of the foundation — and they’re why capital is flowing into BTC-S before it hits open markets. Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t recreate 2011. It builds on what we’ve learned since. Scarcity still drives value. Functionality still beats promises. And timing still matters more than belief. Today is the last day to access BTC-S at 5 USDT. Tomorrow, the protocol continues. The price moves. The curve steepens. What you do now is the part you control.

2025-06-01T06:02:25,"Bitcoin price prediction for June: Will BTC rise or fall in June?","Bitcoin price performed strongly in May, jumping to a record high of $111,900. At its highest point, it was up by over 50% from its lowest point in April, when Donald Trump unveiled his retaliatory tariffs. This BTC forecast looks at what to expect in June. Bitcoin recap for May May was a good month for Bitcoin in a few areas. First, Wall Street investors continued to pump money into BTC during the month. The net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs jumped by over $5.2 billion, while the total value traded during the month jumped to over $73 billion. May was Bitcoin’s best month since January, when the net inflows jumped by $5.25 billion. The surge in inflows brought the cumulative inflows to over $45 billion, making Bitcoin the most successful ETF launches ever. For example, the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) now has over $70 billion in assets under management, 18 months after its launch. In contrast, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) has less than $100 billion in assets, 21 years since its launch. The other big theme in May was the continued Bitcoin purchases by companies, a move that could accelerate following Strategy’s purchases. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, acquired thousands of coins, bringing its total holdings to over 580,235. Twenty One, a company formed between Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether, and Softbank , is acquiring Bitcoins worth over $3 billion. It plans to go public as a Bitcoin holding company. Trump Media, the parent company of TruthSocial, raised $2.5 billion to acquire Bitcoin. GameStop, the game store company, also started to accumulate Bitcoin as we recommended a few months ago. The other big Bitcoin news in May was key events like Consensus Toronto and Token2049 in Dubai. BTC price analysis for June Bitcoin’s price will likely continue doing well in June because of the soaring demand and falling supply. The supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has continued falling, moving from over 3.1 million in 2020 to 1.2 million today. More companies will likely continue acquiring Bitcoins this month, which will help boost its price. The risk, however, is that June is usually one of the worst months for Bitcoin because of the start of the summer season. The average Bitcoin return in June is usually minus 0.50%. The other risk is that the trade war between the US and other countries will continue, leading to more volatility. Also, the Federal Reserve may insist that it will not cut rates soon as inflation remains stubbornly high. Bitcoin price analysis BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Technicals suggest that the BTC price has more upside to go this month as it has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the ongoing retreat being part of the handle section. This cup has a depth of about 32%, meaning that the target price is about $143,000. Bitcoin remains above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Therefore, the most likely scenario is where BTC price rises and hits at least $120,000 this month. A drop below the support at $100,000 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-06-01T05:45:00,"In 60 days, MUTM gained more wallets than PEPE did in its first 3 months","Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has achieved a remarkable milestone by gaining more wallets in just 60 days than Pepe (PEPE) managed during its first three months. While PEPE’s rise was largely driven by hype and speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s rapid growth comes from solid development and genuine utility. This milestone clearly shows that MUTM is more than just a fleeting trend — it is building real traction with lasting potential. Why wallet growth matters Wallet growth is one of the most reliable early indicators of a project’s adoption and future success. Unlike meme tokens that often experience short bursts of hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting users because it offers real value through its decentralized lending and borrowing platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique combination of peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) lending models sets it apart. The P2P model allows users to lend and borrow tokens that are usually unavailable on P2C platforms e.g memecoins like PEPE and DOGE, increasing flexibility and choice. In the P2C model, users pool their assets together, and interest rates adjust automatically based on supply and demand. This dynamic system ensures efficient capital allocation and attractive returns for lenders. Strong passive income potential One of the biggest draws of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its passive income opportunity. Depositing cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), or stablecoins such as DAI into Mutuum’s liquidity pools lets users earn interest that grows as borrowing demand increases. Interest rates fluctuate based on pool utilization, rewarding lenders during periods of high demand with attractive yields. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at the current price of $0.03 could grow 15 to 35 times in value, turning into $15,000 to $35,000. This price appreciation is combined with ongoing passive income from interest and dividends. MUTM token holders who stake their mtTokens also receive rewards funded by protocol revenue buybacks, enhancing long-term earnings. Phase 1 to phase 5: proven growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) started its presale at $0.01 per token during Phase 1. The price has already tripled to $0.03 in Phase 5, reflecting a 200% increase and rewarding early investors handsomely. So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has generated approximately $9.70 million in liquidity with over 11,650 active holders. These figures show strong market interest and support the case for continued growth. According to the project roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a beta version of its platform alongside the live token release. This upcoming beta will allow users to experience the lending and borrowing system firsthand, further driving adoption and engagement. Additionally, ongoing initiatives like the $100,000 giveaway and the recent CertiK audit reinforce the project’s commitment to security and community trust. The CertiK audit completed in May 2025 involved manual review and static analysis, resulting in a solid Token Scan score of 70. This independent verification assures users that Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts are secure and reliable. In an industry where trust is paramount, this audit adds a crucial layer of confidence for both investors and users. Utility that drives sustainable demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s value goes beyond price speculation. Its lending and borrowing system addresses real user needs, such as accessing liquidity without selling assets. Users can deposit ETH or DAI as collateral to borrow other tokens, maintaining exposure to their original holdings while gaining liquidity for new opportunities. This approach helps avoid taxable events and supports more sophisticated trading and investment strategies. Pepe (PEPE) experienced explosive growth fueled mainly by social media hype and community memes. Although it attracted many holders quickly, its utility and long-term value remain limited. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s wallet growth reflects genuine interest fueled by its platform’s functionality, making its trajectory more sustainable and less volatile. While PEPE’s momentum has plateaued, MUTM is still in the early stages of value accumulation with strong foundations. Why now is the best time to invest The difference between Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Phase 1 price of $0.01 and the current Phase 5 price of $0.03 shows how much value has been created so far. But the greatest profit opportunities remain ahead, as later phases will likely offer smaller gains. Early investors who jump in now not only benefit from price appreciation but also start earning passive income immediately. With more than 11,650 holders and nearly $9.70 million generated in liquidity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that this is a once-in-a-cycle opportunity to build generational wealth. The combination of price upside, passive dividends, and expanding platform utility means MUTM tokens are a must-have for serious DeFi participants.

According to the blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, the funds were sent to Ulbricht’s donation wallet just a few hours ago. Crypto community fuels Ulbricht’s fresh start with millions in donations The generous donation is another line of donations Ulbricht has seen since being released. Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange , donated $111,111 in Bitcoin earlier this year to help him adjust to life outside prison. Free Ross also claims to have received over $270,000 in cryptocurrency donations to help Ulbricht prepare for life after prison. Another address associated with Ulbricht collected $4,615 in Ethereum, USDC, Tether (USDT), and Binance Coin (BNB) in the same period. On January 21, 2025, Donald Trump signed a full and unconditional pardon for Silk Road dissenter and operator after 11 years of a double life sentence without parole. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 in New York in a narcotics and money-laundering conspiracy and sentenced to life in prison. Despite his release, questions have been raised as to the financial status of Ulbricht, as reports indicate he could hold access to inactive Bitcoin wallets associated with Silk Road, believed to contain approximately $47m. Ulbricht has been in the news recently after attending the Bitcoin 2025 conference, where he thanked his staunch supporters for coming to his aid while behind bars. He stressed the need for solidarity in the crypto community, saying, “You didn’t leave me. You didn’t forget me. You wrote me letters. You raised money for my defense.” Ulbricht sells some personal items to eliminate the reminders about his arrest The founder of the infamous Silk Road darknet marketplace has also raised approximately $1.8 million in Bitcoin through an auction of personal items and artwork created during his incarceration. The auction, hosted on the Bitcoin-powered collectibles platform Scarce City, featured 13 artifacts from Ulbricht’s life before and during his imprisonment. Among the items auctioned were Ulbricht’s prison ID card, which fetched the highest bid, and an oil painting. Other notable pieces included his prison sneakers, sweatsuit, t-shirt, prison notebook, locker lock, and three ID cards. Additionally, personal items from his life prior to arrest, such as a down sleeping bag, djembe drum, backpack, and a pair of Vibram FiveFingers shoes, were also sold. “I’ve left Arizona, the state where I was in prison. It’s time to travel. That means downsizing and turning the page,” Ulbricht wrote in a message on the auction page . He continued to say that he decided to auction some personal items from before his arrest and during his time in prison. He emphasized that he didn’t need the reminders and noted that some of his supporters would fancy them. Ulbricht’s last prison ID card featuring the early Bitcoin devotee’s broad smile is fetching a winning bid of 11 BTC, now valued at more than $1.1 million. Concerning the broad smile on the ID card, he revealed on the item’s page that Ulbricht still smiled that day despite the guard’s effort to make him stop smiling for the photo. He says his joy comes from within, even though he was in prison. The painting created by Ulbricht and “Omega,” the inmate who taught him oil painting, was another item for auction. Based on reports from sources, the painting took in a high bid of 1.01 BTC. A painting entitled Archway by Ross Ulbricht and another prisoner known as Omega The bidders are set to complete their payment by Monday because the bids are due on June 2. About the painting, Ulbricht said that he was so impressed by how the archway looked in a photo that he had to paint it. He expressed the feeling behind those paintings. According to Ulbricht, the painting made him feel as if he was walking through the archway, as if something amazing was waiting on the other side.

2025-06-01T04:51:50,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is BTC Out of the Woods After 8% Correction?","Bitcoin has faced notable selling pressure at the $111K range, leading to a bearish rejection. Nevertheless, the price lacks sufficient bullish momentum and a deeper correction seems plausible in the mid-term. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Following its breakout above the previous all-time high at $109K and printing a new peak at $111K, Bitcoin met strong resistance that has sparked notable selling pressure. The failure to sustain momentum above this key psychological level has resulted in a bearish rejection, pushing the asset back below the $109K threshold. This price action coincided with the sweep of buy-side liquidity resting above the previous swing high, allowing smart money to execute sell orders efficiently. As a result, the market has entered a corrective phase, now approaching the daily fair value gap (FVG) between $97K and $100K. This zone likely holds substantial demand, potentially acting as a support zone that could trigger a bullish reaction. Should the price stabilize within this FVG, a rebound toward the $111K resistance becomes likely. Conversely, failure to hold this level could pave the way for further downside, with the next key support residing near the $95K region. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, intensified selling pressure at the $111K resistance has caused BTC to break below its previously maintained ascending price channel. The subsequent pullback toward the broken channel boundary near $108K has confirmed the bearish breakout and suggests weakening momentum. Currently, the price is consolidating within a critical support-resistance band spanning from $100K to $108K. As long as Bitcoin remains within this range, short-term volatility is expected. However, a decisive breakout, either above $108K or below $100K, will likely set the tone for the next significant move, with either a bullish recovery or an extended correction unfolding based on the breakout direction. On-chain Analysis The Realized Price of mid-term holders has consistently functioned as a pivotal support or resistance zone, making it a valuable indicator for gauging broader market sentiment. This metric, representing the average on-chain acquisition cost of UTXOs held by long-term investors, often aligns with key turning points in Bitcoin’s price cycle. Currently, Bitcoin remains positioned above the Realized Price of the 3–6 month holder cohort, a signal that this group remains in profit and has not faced significant stress. However, recent selling pressure and a rejection from the $111K level have dragged the price closer to the Realized Price of the 3–6 month holder range, which resides around the $98K zone. This places the $98K–$100K area in the spotlight as a crucial support region. A firm reaction from this zone would confirm continued confidence from mid-term holders and may act as the launchpad for a renewed bullish leg, potentially propelling Bitcoin to fresh all-time highs. Failure to hold this support, however, could shift market sentiment and open the door to deeper corrections.

All eyes are now on a crucial support level around $0.60. The big question — will Pi manage to hold this line, or are we about to see a sharper correction if it slips below this mark? Current Status of Pi Coin Launched in 2019, Pi Coin is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency that allows mining via smartphones, making it widely accessible. After years of anticipation, it was finally listed on exchanges in February 2025. Although initial expectations suggested a listing price of $50, the coin launched at around $3, only to fall to nearly $0.60 — a sharp 78% drop from its peak. Despite this, Pi Coin still commands attention due to its unique mobile-first mining model and a massive user base of over 35 million. Pi has been struggling to break past resistance levels near $0.79, while buyers are showing signs of hesitation at lower levels. Key indicators like the RSI, MACD, and Stochastic RSI reflect weakening momentum, with most metrics leaning bearish. Additionally, a descending wedge pattern has formed since mid-May, yet the price remains trapped inside it. Pi Network Price Prediction For Year End According to CoinDCX, Pi Network is expected to start November 2025 on a bullish note, reclaiming the $2.00 mark and potentially rising to around $2.38 to $2.40 by month’s end. In December, the bullish momentum may strengthen, pushing the price to $2.75 to $2.80. Challenges Facing Pi Coin Mainnet Still Pending : Despite its listing, Pi Network’s full mainnet has not been launched. This raises doubts about its real-world capabilities and long-term viability. Limited Exchange Listings : Pi Coin is available on very few exchanges, restricting access and limiting trading volume. Regulatory Uncertainty : Like many cryptocurrencies, Pi Coin faces regulatory hurdles, adding to investor caution. Overhyped Comparisons to Bitcoin : Although some claim Pi Coin could reach $1,000 or more, such projections seem far-fetched. At that price, its market cap would exceed $6 trillion — compared to its current estimated valuation of just $500 million.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-2025-year-end-price-prediction/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

2025-06-01T04:00:17,"Ethereum Pulls Back 10% But Holds Monthly Gains – Is The Next Pump Loading?","Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 level, showing resilience as the broader crypto market undergoes a healthy pullback. Despite recent volatility, ETH continues to trade within a bullish structure, fueling optimism that it could lead the next leg of the market’s rally. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum’s price action, calling for a potential breakout that might set the tone for an anticipated altseason. Related Reading: Solana Flashes Buy Signal – $159 Support Key For Rebound Top analyst Ted Pillows shared key insights, noting that Ethereum is down just 10% from its local highs, yet up nearly 50% this month alone. This strong monthly performance is a clear indication that Ethereum remains in an uptrend, even as short-term corrections occur. According to Pillows, this kind of price behavior—holding steady while the market resets—often precedes aggressive moves, particularly if Ethereum can reclaim higher resistance levels in the coming days. With Bitcoin consolidating below its all-time highs and market participants eyeing renewed capital rotation into altcoins, Ethereum is well-positioned to act as a catalyst. A decisive move above $2,700 could validate the bullish outlook and trigger broader momentum across the altcoin market. For now, Ethereum’s relative strength continues to stand out amid market uncertainty. Ethereum Uptrend Holds Firm Despite Global Tensions Ethereum is facing a pivotal test as it continues to trade within a tight range since May 10th, hovering between key support and resistance zones. While macroeconomic uncertainty weighs heavily on traditional markets—driven by rising US Treasury yields and geopolitical tensions—Ethereum has shown impressive resilience. Bulls remain confident that ETH has room to push higher, supported by strong fundamentals and improving investor sentiment. Pillows highlights that despite a recent 10% pullback from local highs, Ethereum is still up nearly 50% this month. This sharp monthly gain clearly indicates that ETH remains in a strong uptrend, even as volatility tests short-term conviction. The fact that ETH has maintained higher lows throughout this range-bound structure reinforces the idea of accumulation, not distribution. Beyond price action, on-chain and institutional signals point toward sustained demand. ETF inflows for Ethereum have begun to pick up, albeit at a slower pace than Bitcoin’s. However, due to Ethereum’s smaller market cap, these flows have a more pronounced impact. Additionally, multiple firms are reportedly raising over $1 billion to acquire ETH, signaling long-term confidence in the asset’s role in the evolving digital economy. Pillows sees the stage set for Ethereum’s next major leg up. If the $2,700–$2,850 resistance zone is broken with conviction, it could trigger a strong rally that positions ETH as a leader in a potential altseason. For now, Ethereum’s steady hand in turbulent times is a bullish signal in itself. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Defend Support – Key Indicator Hints At Short-Term Rally Ethereum Weekly Chart Holds Firm Ethereum is showing resilience on the weekly chart, trading at $2,509 after reaching a high of $2,789 earlier in the week. While the price has pulled back slightly, it remains firmly above the 200-week SMA ($2,452) and the 34-week EMA ($2,498), which is a strong sign of underlying bullish structure. This area is now acting as solid support after ETH’s 50% rally off the April lows. What’s technically notable is that ETH is challenging the underside of the 100-week and 50-week SMAs, both of which have previously acted as resistance throughout this cycle. A close above $2,725 would mark a significant shift in trend, confirming bullish continuation and opening the door for a test of the $3,000–$3,200 zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Pulls Back To 20DMA After $2,700 Rejection: Testing Strength At Key Support Volume has slightly decreased from the breakout candle three weeks ago, suggesting consolidation rather than weakness.

2025-06-01T03:36:34,"Bitcoin Price Retreat Sparks Talk of ‘Deeper Correction’ as Bulls Pause","Bitcoin has pulled back sharply, sparking renewed caution from analysts who warn that the digital asset may be headed for a deeper correction before resuming its bullish trajectory. BTC/USD fell by 8% as of May 31, retreating to levels below its previous all-time high. This decline leaves the token nearly $9,000 below its recent record peak, putting short-term sentiment to the test. Demand Metrics Signal a Cooling Trend A report from CryptoQuant shared with Cointelegraph suggests that Bitcoin’s demand growth may be hitting a temporary ceiling. The analytics platform estimates that Bitcoin demand has increased by 229,000 BTC in the last 30 days, nearing the 279,000 BTC peak seen in December 2024. “Some of Bitcoin’s demand metrics may be reaching a short-term top, which could imply a pause in the current rally,” the report stated. It also noted that whale balances have risen by 2.8% over the past month, a pattern often followed by reduced accumulation from major holders. Additionally, average unrealized profits hovered around 30% when prices neared $111,000—another sign of an imminent slowdown. Analysts Eye Key Technical Levels Prominent trader Mags highlighted the importance of the upcoming weekly candle close. “On the daily chart, BTC has broken below the previous all-time high and is facing rejection at that same level,” Mags observed. “This might look like the start of a deeper correction.” If Bitcoin closes the week below the December 2024 high of $104,450, it may form a bearish pattern before climbing again, he added. Bull Market Outlook Remains Intact for Now Despite the current retreat, broader sentiment remains optimistic. Trader Aksel Kibar said the bull market structure is still intact, provided prices remain above $73,700. He reiterated his 2025 target of $137,000 for BTC, aligning with a midterm bullish outlook. CryptoQuant analysts see $120,000 as a key level where many investors might choose to lock in profits. While the path forward could involve further short-term losses, most analysts agree the bull market has not been derailed.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-price-retreat-sparks-talk-of-deeper-correction-as-bulls-pause/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

Notably, signs of exhaustion are also beginning to surface for Bitcoin, especially in the past 48 hours. While long-term indicators suggest a bullish continuation for the Bitcoin price, short-term models indicate a breakdown of bullish strength, particularly as the cryptocurrency approaches the critical $100,000 support zone. Related Reading: $10 Million Fix? SUI Network Moves Fast After Cetus Exploit Scare This sentiment is relayed by popular crypto analyst Willy Woo, who shared the good and bad news based on Bitcoin’s current technicals. Good News: A Bullish Long-Term Signal Still Intact According to Woo, one of the strongest long-term signals, the Bitcoin Risk Signal, is currently trending downwards. This drop indicates that buy-side liquidity is currently dominant in the long-term environment, setting the stage for another strong leg upward. The lower the risk reading, the safer it is to hold or accumulate Bitcoin, and this signal’s current decline shows a relatively low-risk environment for long-term investors. Woo noted that this long-term setup is intact, and with Bitcoin trading well above the psychological six-figure mark, the momentum is still in favor of the bulls in the long term. At the time of writing, the local risk model, as shown in the chart below, is currently in the mid-range, having declined from peak levels in early 2025, and is expected to continue trending downwards. In another analysis, Willy Woo noted the next significant move could push it above $114,000 and trigger liquidations of short positions. Bad News For Bitcoin Price Although the long-term picture is still favorable, the short-term models, including the Speculation and SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) metrics, are flashing caution. Using this indicator, Woo noted that the strength of the rally from $75,000 to $112,000 has started to weaken, especially with flat capital inflow in the past three days. Keeping this in mind, Bitcoin’s price action this week is critical. “If we do not get follow through, then we will be up for another consolidation period,” the analyst said. If spot buying fails to pick up strongly in the coming week, which is the first week of June, especially with U.S. markets reopening after a long weekend, there will be a chance for a bearish pivot. The good and bad news can be summed up as follows: if buying pressure opens up quickly, Bitcoin could break above $114,000 and head toward the next major liquidity zone between $118,000 and $120,000. Failure to push higher could confirm bearish divergences and set the stage for another round of consolidation. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin?
