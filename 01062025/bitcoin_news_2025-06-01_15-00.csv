2025-06-01T12:36:49,"Ripple’s XRP $27 Moonshot: Analyst Predicts 1,772% Explosion Following 2017 Historical Pattern","Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has broken previous highs and set a new record high at $111,861 . However, as the big bull continues its unwavering streak, alternative tokens fail to follow the asset’s direction. Ripple’s XRP , a leading altcoin, was one of many that failed to meet market expectations last week. Despite this, market analysts’ sentiments are firmly within bullish territory. Egrag Crypto, a prominent analyst in the X crypto space, has made an assertion validating multiple bullish possibilities for the asset. The analyst revisits XRP’s 2017 performance and explains that a breakout could be around the corner if the altcoin mimics historical patterns. “If XRP is repeating the last section or pattern from October 2017, we might be on the brink of a major breakout soon! Back in October 2017, XRP took roughly 63 days to explode and set a new all-time high, skyrocketing by an astonishing 1,772%!” He wrote. The analyst added that if XRP follows this pattern, the asset could reach the $27 mark in the next few months. He points to the 21-week EMA as a virtual support level and a last line of defense for the XRP. As such, remaining above the $2.30 price mark could sustain the bullish momentum. For the bullish breakout to occur, XRP bulls are expected to close above the Fib 1.414 level around the $2.70 price mark, which would be indicative of a strong bullish signal going forward. The ultimate target, however, is a break above the $3.00 high reached in February. The analyst remains convinced that this move could happen in the near term. “Cycle analysis: If we mirror October 2017’s duration, the peak might occur around July 21, 2025 — roughly two months from now! A cycle top in July suggests BTC may also challenge new ATHs within the next 40 days.” He concluded.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-27-moonshot-analyst-predicts-1772-explosion-following-2017-historical-pattern/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-01T12:30:19,"Bitcoin’s Next Big Buyer? Saylor Points To Bank Of England","According to Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, the Bank of England may soon add Bitcoin to its reserves. He made the comment during Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, where Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, spoke about his party’s new plan. Farage said Reform UK wants the Bank of England to hold a “Bitcoin digital reserve.” He also introduced a bill that would cut capital gains tax on crypto from 24% to 10%. Saylor’s View On Bitcoin Reserves Saylor described Bitcoin as the “ultimate form of capital.” He said investors should think about moving money out of regular currencies and bonds into crypto. His firm, Strategy , has been buying Bitcoin for years. Bank of England on the Brink… of Buying Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/8mdXj0SZ5l — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 30, 2025 Based on reports, US regulators now allow banks to hold and trade crypto . That makes it more likely that big institutions will get involved. If the Bank of England does buy Bitcoin, it would mark a big shift. Central banks usually stick to gold or government bonds. Shifting even a small slice of reserves to Bitcoin could change how people view digital coins. Reform UK’s Crypto Plan Reform UK has opened up to crypto donations, making it the first UK party to do so. Farage said banks must not close accounts for people who buy or sell crypto. He suggested allowing taxpayers to pay tax bills in Bitcoin. The proposed Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill would set new rules to protect crypto users and encourage firms to offer crypto services. Reform UK’s chairman, Zia Yusuf, said cutting crypto taxes could bring rich entrepreneurs back to Britain. He pointed out that a lot of wealthy people leave for places with lower taxes on digital assets. Tax Cuts To Attract Entrepreneurs Reports disclosed that Reform UK wants to drop capital gains tax on crypto from 24% down to 10%. Yusuf said this change could reverse the flow of talent leaving the UK. If companies see they can keep more profits, they might stay or move here. That could lead to more jobs and more tech start-ups. But critics warn that cutting taxes could leave a hole in government revenue. In turn, the Treasury might have to find money elsewhere or cut services.

2025-06-01T12:29:00,"Bitcoin’s Year-End Price Prediction Comes in Hot With Experts Pointing to $200,000","Bitcoin’s rise to the $111,970 price mark has left market participants even more optimistic for the third and final quarters, with fresh bullish price forecasts frequently making the rounds. While the predictions accommodate both bullish and bearish possibilities, price forecasts are going up to $200,000 as an attainable level in 2025. Identifying the factors validating this potential outcome, prominent analyst TradingShot first observed that the BTCUSD pair is experiencing the weakest bull cycle in history, which he believes is a “product of the Theory of Diminishing Returns (TDM).” Notably, the first market cycles appeared to have been more aggressive, with incoming gains hitting rooftop levels, as the market’s upside potential seemed larger in its beginning stages. The analyst revisited the 2025 to 2017 and 2019 to 2021 bull cycles, stating that these periods were in harmony with the traditional capital market. However, the market seems to be headed in a different direction now. “ The current Cycle (2023 – 2025), following the late February 2025 divergence, is now attempting to converge again with its strong rebound in the past 6 weeks. Being however within a Channel Up throughout the entirety of the Cycle, it appears that it will do so in a structured way and as the ( Theory of Diminishing Returns) TDM suggests, will offer weaker gains.” He asserted . He conclusively deduces the timing of the Cycle Top by referring to previous market cycles, projecting that this time, the bull cycle could reach the top between October, November, or December. At this time, the asset is supposed to have hit its peak, around the $150,000 to $200,000 price range. At report time, Bitcoin is down 0.11% over the last hour but has remained above the $104,000 level since hitting a new price high.

2025-06-01T12:26:00,"Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Stuck? ChatGPT Weighs In","TL;DR Bitcoin charted a new all-time high, and even Ethereum managed to post some impressive gains in the past month. However, Ripple’s cross-border token has failed to recapture any of its previous momentum. Here’s what ChatGPT thinks about the current situation and what might be the cause of it. Also, will there be a breakout soon? Current Price Landscape Numerous prominent crypto analysts have outlined in the past several weeks how important the support levels of $2.3 and $2 are for XRP’s future price movements. The former, though, has already been broken to the downside and many of them believe the asset is primed for another retracement toward the latter. Recall that the last time XRP slumped beneath $2 was in early April as the financial world braced for the impact of Trump’s growing and constant tariffs against essentially every country. Although the economic situation improved dramatically in the following two months and many cryptocurrencies, such as the aforementioned new BTC peak and ETH’s revival, marked impressive gains, XRP remained on the sidelines to some extent and was quickly stopped during its surge toward $2.6. It was (and still remains) confined in a descending pattern that has seen another 6.5% decline on a weekly scale. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Why So? ChatGPT first listed the broader market conditions as one of the reasons behind XRP’s stagnation, but that sounds accurate only if we take into account the past week, in which many digital assets have turned red. However, XRP has been outperformed by ETH, BTC, and many, many alts, such as HYPE , on a monthly scale as well. The AI solution noted that investor sentiment and behavior have changed lately toward XRP, as the post-US election hype has evaporated. Now, even though Ripple essentially won its legal fight against the SEC, investors are “opting to sell during minor price increases rather than holding for long-term gains.” ChatGPT mentioned XRP’s tokenomics, in which a billion new coins are released monthly. According to its answer, this continues to add selling pressure for XRP and may hinder its progress. “This consistent increase in available tokens can suppress price growth, especially if demand doesn’t keep pace.” On the question of what could help XRP break out of its consolidation, the AI chatbot said it might take a significant change in investor behavior, such as whales going on a massive accumulation spree similar to the one at the end of 2024, as well as an overall improvement in the market. Additionally, big partnership or acquisitions can aso fuel a new rally. The post Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Stuck?

2025-06-01T12:16:33,"Anthony Scaramucci says Solana will Seamlessly Substitute Banks for IPOs","SkyBridge’s Anthony Scaramucci, while speaking at the Solana Accelerate conference, made some key predictions about the Solana ecosystem. Scaramucci most notably affirmed that bringing Initial public offerings (IPOs) on-chain is possible and allows non-traditional users affiliated with banks to purchase IPOs through their wallets. “You can actually crowdsource the public offering through the tokenization process.” He remarked. When asked about the state of institutional investors and their interest levels in Solana, he revealed that he was authoring a book on Solana titled “Solana Rising”. While interviewing Chief Technology Officers around Wall Street for the book, he revealed that Solana’s scale, functionality, affordability, and throughput position the network to become one of the principal rail systems. “If Bitcoin is the operating layer for money, Solana will be the operating layer for real-world assets, stocks, bonds, and tokenization.” He asserted. Speaking of skeptics, particularly Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who maintains that he is not a fan of Bitcoin and has shown almost no interest in the broader crypto market, Scaramucci believes he will “come around.” He explains that Dimon, surrounded by Senator Elizabeth Warren, tasked with regulating the financial system, is understandably “towing the line.” He further credits the Trump administration for reshaping the system. Scaramucci conclusively disclosed that he and Michael Saylor are fixed on the process of assets transitioning into yield-bearing assets. “Solana certainly, you have the staking situation, but Solana is going to be a healthy enough operating system where you’re going to be able to lend your Solana out, go to a Goldman Sachs of crypto, like a Galaxy, post up your Solana. Sure, you’ll get your staking, but you will also be able to lend it out and get yield in addition to that.” He remarked.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/anthony-scaramucci-says-solana-will-seamlessly-substitute-banks-for-ipos/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TECHNOLOGY","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare

According to reports, the partnership has birthed a digital platform for its fans called PSG World. The launch of the PSG World platform was announced earlier, with the platform going live just before the UEFA Champions League final, where its men’s team came out victorious in a 5-0 victory over Italian side Internazionale. According to the club, the latest initiative is a push forward in its strategy to strengthen the relationship between its fans across the world. The platform was also designed to act as a forum for members. PSG launches new platform to strengthen fan relationships According to the football club, the platform will provide a home for its supporters to share their pre-match and post-match thoughts, acting as a commentary center for the fans. Users will also be able to co-create content, access exclusive media, and build global connections around their football club. Speaking at the Bitcoin Conference in 2025, Pär Helgosson, Head of PSG Labs, discussed the vision of the French club for PSG World. The discussion also involved other prominent members of the crypto community, including the founder and CEO of Roundtable, James Heckman, and Managing Partner at Blockchain Founders Fund, Aly Madhavji. “As we look ahead, our mission is to deepen our connection with fans — not just in France, but around the world,” Pär Helgosson said. “And that means meeting them where they are, online, on-chain, and in their culture.” Helgosson also added that one of the issues of today is that clubs don’t try enough to own their audience data, and PSG is planning to fix it with the new platform. “We have all these fans running for us but they’re not always on our platforms,” he said. “The challenge is to build a direct channel — to capture more data, understand our fans better, and engage them in more relevant ways.” According to the club, the platform will be powered by RTB, a SaaS technology company providing full-stack, white-label community and infrastructure for brands, journalists, and creators. RTB’s vision fulfills the dream of premium brands by uniting them under a single Web3 SaaS platform. The architecture also offers an array of features, tools, and distribution assets, which are already being used by several partners. Helgosson says the club will tap its global reach Speaking alongside Madhavji, Helgosson discussed the scale of the club’s audience, noting that the club is as big in all parts of the world as they are in France, even bigger in some places. Heckman also added contact to the club’s global footprint, noting the number of players they have from diverse countries. “A team in Paris has stars from Argentina, Brazil, Italy, England, and Germany. When you claimed half a billion fans, it sounded ludicrous — but it’s actually true,” he said. Founded in 1970, PSG has grown into one of the most recognizable brands in world football. With its digital presence expanding, the club is prepared to unveil this new model of sports engagement. However, the strategy isn’t about just the reach, it is about building a meaningful and persistent relationship with its fans. The platform adds physical, digital, and blockchain-based tools to shape that interaction. “We dominated social, online today. And we also want to dominate in on-chain and all tokenized ways,” Helgosson said. “We want to engage our fan base across what we do offline, online today — and on-chain tomorrow.” Helgosson also mentioned that the club has taken some financial bets on Bitcoin, noting that it took some of its fiat reserves and allocated it into Bitcoin last year. He added that they are the largest club doing it globally. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

It seems like every few days, there’s news about another business joining the growing list of Bitcoin investors. One of the first big names in this space was MicroStrategy, led by its CEO, Michael Saylor. Years ago, the company began buying Bitcoin, and since then, its stock price has jumped by an incredible 3,000%. Saylor has said he believes other companies will have no choice but to follow, especially as Bitcoin prices keep rising. Why Are More Companies Buying Bitcoin? As explained by an analyst, it’s simple: when a few companies start buying Bitcoin and their stock prices rise, other businesses take notice. Soon, more companies feel pressured to join in, which pushes Bitcoin’s price even higher. As the price rises, it becomes more expensive for new buyers to enter the market, which creates a rush to buy before prices climb further. New Player From Indonesia A company called DigiAsia from Indonesia has just announced its plans to buy $100 million worth of Bitcoin. While it’s not as big as MicroStrategy’s investments, it’s still a huge amount. What’s more surprising is that DigiAsia plans to use 50% of its future profits to keep buying Bitcoin. This shows they’re serious about making cryptocurrency a key part of their financial strategy. More Big Numbers from Other Companies Another company called MetaPlanet has also been making headlines. They want to build a Bitcoin reserve of 10,000 Bitcoins by the end of this year, and 21,000 by the end of next year. Recently, they revealed they’ve already collected over 6,700 Bitcoins — much faster than expected. The big question now is: with Bitcoin’s price expected to rise to around $370,000 to $500,000 by the end of this year, will these companies still be willing to buy more at such high prices? And what will happen if Bitcoin hits $2.4 million by 2029 or 2030, as some predictions suggest? What Does This Mean for Regular Bitcoin Holders? Every time a company buys thousands of Bitcoins, it reduces the number of coins available for everyone else. Some experts have said that one day, even millionaires and billionaires won’t be able to buy a full Bitcoin because so many have been taken off the market by big companies. There’s an old idea in the crypto world that owning just 0.28 Bitcoin would put you in the top 1% of Bitcoin holders. Back then, people thought it was a small number. But with companies grabbing up huge amounts of Bitcoin, that 0.28 BTC is starting to look a lot more valuable. In Short More and more companies are buying Bitcoin as a long-term investment. As these businesses keep adding to their Bitcoin reserves, it could drive prices up and make it harder for others to buy in the future. And if Bitcoin reaches the price levels some experts predict, it’ll make the small amounts of Bitcoin owned by regular investors even more valuable.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-rich-list-whos-stacking-whos-slacking/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that BTC has until Monday to avoid printing a bearish divergence on the weekly chart. A bearish divergence happens when price makes higher highs, while an indicator like the relative strength index (RSI) makes lower highs, suggesting that an asset is losing bullish momentum. Says Woo, “Dear Mr Bitcoin, you have [until Monday] to rally or you’re gonna print a bearish divergence on weekly charts and then we will be bored for weeks and weeks.” Source: Willy Woo/X Using proprietary data from his Bitcoin analysis firm, the Bitcoin Vector, Woo says that BTC appears to be strong, but may be “equalizing” itself after rallying faster than usual in previous months. “Our Bitcoin Vector framework remains strong despite the pullback. What’s happening is technical resistance in the form of a bearish divergence playing out against strong fundamentals. Basically, BTC ran up faster than normal and is equalizing.” Source: Willy Woo/X While many traders are still betting on the traditional halving-based four-year cycles, Woo says BTC is becoming more linked to external macro forces, and that predictable, cyclical price patterns are now a thing of the past. “BTC is global macro this cycle. Which means don’t necessarily bet on nicely manicured four-year cycles. BTC is transitioning.

The items, sold exclusively via the Bitcoin-only marketplace Scarce City, offered collectors a chance to own a piece of crypto history, just months after Ulbricht was pardoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump. The auction, which included both personal effects from before Ulbricht’s 2013 arrest and memorabilia from his time behind bars, attracted strong interest from the crypto community. Items ranged from a well-worn sleeping bag and backpack to prison clothing, artwork, and even his final prison-issued ID card . “I’ve left Arizona, the state where I was in prison. It’s time to travel. That means downsizing and turning the page,” Ulbricht wrote on the auction page. “I don’t need the reminders and I’m sure some of you will love to have them.” ID Card Sells for Over $1 Million Among the most coveted items was Ulbricht’s final prison ID card, which sold for an astonishing 11 BTC — over $1.1 million at current prices. “The guard tried to get me to stop smiling for the photo, but my joy comes from within,” Ulbricht remarked in a personal note. “So I smiled that day, even though I was in prison.” Another standout was a painting co-created by Ulbricht and a fellow inmate known as “Omega,” which fetched 1.01 BTC. Ulbricht described the piece as a symbol of hope: “It gave me the feeling that, if I could pass through it, something better would be on the other side.” The auction was structured to ensure fairness, requiring a 1% collateral deposit from bidders and a resettable countdown to deter last-minute bid sniping. All payments must be finalized by June 2, with Bitcoin preferred, although small PayPal payments were accepted. Ulbricht Dormant Bitcoin Holdings Beyond the auction, Ulbricht could potentially regain access to millions in dormant Bitcoin. According to Coinbase’s Conor Grogan, about 430 BTC — currently worth around $47 million — remain untouched in wallets tied to Ulbricht that were never seized. Blockchain firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed the findings, identifying 14 such wallets . One of them alone holds over $9 million in BTC. These funds have been inactive for more than 13 years, stirring speculation about their future use following Ulbricht’s release.

Its price is stuck at the same level where it began the year, underperforming Bitcoin, which has risen 15% in 2025. Ripple ( XRP ) price was trading at $2.140 on Sunday as its volume and futures open interest remained under pressure. This article highlights the top four reasons it may jump by 50% and retest the year-to-date high of $3.4 in June. You might also like: Bitcoin price pulls back as analysts tout $1m–$2.4m potential The Securities and Exchange Commission will decide on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF by June 17. Approval would likely help boost the XRP price because of the expected inflows from Wall Street investors. JPMorgan analysts estimate the fund would attract over $8 billion in funds in the first year. However, the likely scenario is that the SEC delays the approval again, possibly until October. Polymarket traders place the odds of approval by July 31 at 21%, and by the end of the year at 83% . Crypto traders are pricing an eventual XRP price breakout in the coming weeks. The eight-hour funding rate has remained in the positive zone in the past few weeks. A positive funding rate is essential data in perpetual futures, meaning traders anticipate the price to be higher. As we wrote here , there are signs that Bitcoin will make a bullish breakout. We cited the bullish forecasts by top analysts and the fact that it is forming the handle section of the cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern points to an eventual Bitcoin surge to $143,000. A Bitcoin price breakout will likely push other cryptocurrencies, including XRP, higher. The final reason the Ripple price may break out and surge to $3.4 is its strong technicals. See below.

2025-06-01T11:20:37,"Prepare to see Bitcoin produce a ‘red week’ if this level breaks, warns expert","A trading expert has highlighted the importance of Bitcoin ( BTC ) holding above the $100,000 mark, warning that a drop below could trigger a sharp correction. Specifically, Master Ananda’s analysis shows that the $100,000 to $103,000 range now serves as Bitcoin’s key support. If this level fails, traders should brace for a red week followed by sideways consolidation before any meaningful recovery, according to a May 31 post on TradingView. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Ananda noted that Bitcoin has already dipped into this zone, and the market is watching closely to see if it will hold or break under pressure. His analysis emphasized the critical nature of this range. Bitcoin recently reversed from highs near $112,000, pulling back to test support. If the level breaks, a deeper correction could follow, with downside targets near $88,000, a key Fibonacci retracement level. However, if support holds, the analyst expects a sharp rebound that could push Bitcoin to new highs above $130,000. “Between $100,000 and $103,000. If this level breaks, prepare to see Bitcoin producing another week red then consolidation, on and on, before the next high,” he said. While the short-term outlook is uncertain, Ananda remains bullish in the long run. He pointed out that retracements are typical and healthy in any uptrend. He also suggested the current pullback may offer a rare buying opportunity for those who missed earlier entries. Bitcoin’s price next key target This analysis comes as Bitcoin attempts to reclaim the $105,000 support zone , which could anchor a move to new highs. Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin ended May with its highest monthly close on record. Looking ahead, market analysts believe Bitcoin could resume its bullish trend and target new highs above $120,000. In a June 1 post on X, Pseudonymous analyst Mags noted that Bitcoin is completing a bullish “cup and handle” breakout pattern, with a potential target of $125,000. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Mags The pattern is a continuation setup where an asset forms a rounded bottom (“cup”) followed by a consolidation (“handle”). A breakout above the resistance neckline often leads to a rally roughly equal to the depth of the cup. This supports the view that Bitcoin’s breakout from the $65,000 to $70,000 resistance channel has laid the groundwork for further gains. Following the breakout, Bitcoin has already crossed the $100,000 threshold and continues to push higher. Bitcoin price analysis At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $104,009, up 0.5% over the past 24 hours, though down 5.5% on the week. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

2025-06-01T11:05:02,"Bitcoin to $150K or Back to $92K? Traders Divided as Market Cools Off","Bitcoin (BTC) smashed a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 on May 22, but the party may be over, at least for now. After rallying by more than $15,000 over the month, the king crypto has shed $9,000 in the last week alone, slipping to the $103,000 level, putting traders on edge and sparking new debate: Is this a healthy cooldown or the start of a deeper plunge? Technical Red Flags Flashing Volatility is back with a vengeance. In the last 24 hours, BTC has swung between $103,300 and $105,000, reflecting growing market uncertainty. Zooming out, it’s still up 9.1% in the last 30 days and 52.1% over the past year, but the momentum seems to be fading. According to data shared by analyst Axel Adler Jr., Bitcoin just triggered four consecutive sell signals on CryptoQuant’s Net UTXO Supply ratio. “This is a typical pattern for an overheated market phase, where profit-taking occurs and demand begins to lag supply,” he warned, highlighting the red flag that often comes before short-term tops. Further, the market watcher pointed to two possible scenarios for the asset: a sideways purgatory, with BTC drifting sideways between $95,000 and $105,000 for weeks, or a mid pullback that could see it plunge toward $92,000 in a bid to “relieve overbought conditions.” Betting Big on Bitcoin However, others are more optimistic, or delusional, depending on who you ask. According to BetIdeas in an email to CryptoPotato , there’s an 80% chance of BTC hitting $120,000 in 2025, and a 40% shot at $150,000. “The volatile nature of crypto is what will always grab the headlines but with the upwards trend in May with Bitcoin being increasingly positive, it looks as though a big run for Bitcoin holders is coming,” wrote spokesman Steve McQuillan. He stated that traders on the platform had placed a 22% chance on a run toward $200,000 before the end of the year. Meanwhile, popular analyst Daan Crypto Trades has pointed to the zone between $97,000 and $99,000 as a key level to watch for a potential bounce, citing Fibonacci retracement levels and the 200-day moving average. Elsewhere, Michaël van de Poppe doesn’t seem too fazed by the current goings on in the market, terming it “consolidation and correction,” which, in his opinion , is “very healthy and normal.” The post Bitcoin to $150K or Back to $92K?

It raised concerns over legal risks and energy strain. Pakistan advances national crypto and blockchain strategy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is pushing back on Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers as the country navigates tough financial negotiations with the Fund. The initiative, unveiled last week, is part of a broader push to attract blockchain firms, AI companies, and crypto miners to Pakistan. However, according to a report by local outlet Samaa , the IMF has flagged several concerns — primarily the legality of crypto mining in the country and the strain such a move could place on its already fragile power grid. IMF Seeks Urgent Clarification on Pakistan’s Crypto Mining Plan The IMF was reportedly not consulted ahead of the announcement and is now seeking urgent clarification from the Finance Ministry. With Pakistan facing chronic energy shortages and inflationary pressures, the Fund has also warned about potential knock-on effects on power tariffs and resource distribution. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” an official involved in the negotiations told Samaa . “The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the talks.” While I'm an optimist by nature and I really hope I'm wrong, I think Pakistan will struggle to follow through on its Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining plans Short answer why: IMF Mid-sized answer why: * Bitcoin is a huge threat to IMF in 5 ways. * Pakistan are heavily indebted… pic.twitter.com/4t4BO6Keqm — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) May 31, 2025 The IMF delegation, which is currently holding virtual discussions with Pakistani authorities, is expected to hold a dedicated session on the electricity plan for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers in the coming days. The power allocation is part of a wider national strategy to integrate digital assets into Pakistan’s economy. A key piece of this strategy is the new Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), approved by the Finance Ministry on May 21. The PDAA will oversee the regulation of exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and the tokenization of national assets in line with global standards, including those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Pakistan Launches Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The move follows Pakistan’s surprise debut of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference last week. During the event, Bilal bin Saqib, crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, unveiled plans for a national Bitcoin wallet and reaffirmed the government’s support for the digital asset sector. Pakistan began shifting its crypto policy earlier this year with the proposal of a “National Crypto Council,” tasked with building a regulatory framework and driving foreign investment into the country’s emerging crypto ecosystem. Last week, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif elevated Bilal Bin Saqib to the role of Special Assistant to the PM on Blockchain and Crypto, granting him the status of a minister of state. As Special Assistant, Saqib will be tasked with key responsibilities: drafting FATF-compliant crypto regulations, launching state-backed Bitcoin mining projects, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, land records, and finance. He will also supervise licensing of virtual asset service providers and advance investor protection measures in the Web3 space.

2025-06-01T10:31:11,"Crypto users lost $244M to scammers in May, down 40% from April: PeckShield","Crypto scammers made away with about $244 million in the month of May, a new PeckShield report has shown. According to the report, the stolen amount dropped drastically from April stats, with the largest incident making up 90% of the month’s total. According to a post by PeckShield on X, the blockchain security firm mentioned that the crypto industry recorded about 20 hacks, pushing the total amount lost to $244.1 million. “In May 2025, ~20 major crypto hacks were recorded, resulting in total losses of $244.1M — a 39.29% decrease from April,” PeckShied said. The decline comes as the crypto industry has been putting measures in place and stepping up efforts to combat these activities. Funds from the Cetus DEX hack frozen According to the blockchain security firm, the biggest hack that occurred last month happened on the Cetus decentralized exchange. The platform suffered a breach on May 22, resulting in the loss of about $223 million in users’ funds. The incident was reported by pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3, who posted on X that the Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited. According to blockchain security firm Dedaub, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MBS) check. #PeckShieldAlert In May 2025, ~20 major crypto hacks were recorded, resulting in total losses of $244.1M—a 39.29% decrease from April.

It then allowed them to establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. “This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens,” the blockchain security firm said in its report. PeckShield added that Cetus and the Sui Network had frozen about $157 million in stolen funds, which represents about 71% of the entire cache. PeckShield noted that the second-largest exploit of May was the attack on the decentralized finance platform Cork Protocol . According to cybersecurity firm Cyvers, the Cork Protocol hacker used the exploit to cart away about 3,761 Wrapped States Ether (wstETH), which they converted to Ethereum. The last three of the top five hacks for the month were an MBU tokens exploit worth $2.2 million, a MapleStory Universe exploit of $1.2 million, and an attack suspected to be linked to the DPRK, worth $5.2 million. Industry steps up the war against crypto hackers The PeckShield report comes after increased efforts by the crypto industry to protect itself against bad actors. According to previous reports, the security team of crypto exchange BitMEX released a report where it mentioned that it discovered gaps in the operational security of the Lazarus group, a North Korean cybercrime group that is alleged to have ties to the government of the country. During the counter operations probe into the organization, the platform discovered IP addresses, a database, and tracking algorithms deployed by the group. According to some of the security researchers, there is a likelihood that one of the hackers in the group accidentally revealed his true IP address, which they said showed the actual location of the hacker to be in Jiaxing, China. The researchers also said they were also able to access a Supabase database, a platform for easily deploying databases with simple interfaces for applications, used by the hacking group. According to PeckShield, the crypto industry lost over $1.63 billion to hackers, with the blockchain security platform pointing out that the Bybit exploit accounted for more than 92% of the entire loss. The firm also pointed out that over $487 million in crypto was lost to hackers in January, while February saw a jump to $1.53 billion due to the Bybit incident, which has been dubbed the largest crypto heist to date.

2025-06-01T10:10:35,"SEC Challenges ETF Status of Proposed Staked Solana and Ether Funds","Key Takeaways: The SEC has questioned the structure of proposed staked Solana and Ether ETFs. The agency flagged the C-corp structure as conflicting with ETF regulations. Final decisions on staking ETFs are likely delayed until October. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised concerns about the structure of proposed Solana (SOL) and Ether (ETH) staked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), arguing that the products may not qualify as ETFs under current regulations. ETF provider REX Financial and asset manager Osprey Funds recently submitted amendments for the funds’ registration. However, according to Bloomberg, the SEC flagged the use of a c-corporation (c-corp) structure, a rare choice for ETFs, as conflicting with Rule 6C-11, commonly referred to as the “ETF rule,” which defines permitted fund structures. SEC Flags Compliance Issues in Proposed ETF Structures The SEC staff said they continue to have unresolved questions about whether the proposed funds, if structured and operated as planned, meet the definition of an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act, according to a letter dated May 30. The letter further warned that disclosures about the funds’ investment company status “may be potentially misleading.” Despite the regulatory pushback, analysts remain hopeful. “REX lawyers say they can work it out,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a May 31 post on X. “Issuers are pushing the envelope hard in an effort to get first to market.” Update: SEC sent letter to REX last night saying it was concerned SEC improperly filed.

Saturday scoop from @isabelletanlee https://t.co/6fnYf5Oo2V pic.twitter.com/NHTvOQyDsO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 31, 2025 Market participants are closely tracking the progress of altcoin and staking-based ETFs, viewing them as a potential gateway for fresh institutional capital to enter the crypto sector. The SEC’s caution comes even after it clarified earlier this year that crypto staking, in itself, does not constitute a securities transaction. Still, the agency has delayed rulings on several staking and altcoin ETF applications. These delays are not unexpected. “Almost all of these filings have final due dates in October,” Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart wrote. “It is uncommon for ETF applications to be approved so early.” BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Sees Record $430M Outflows As reported, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded $430.8 million in outflows on May 30, ending a 31-day inflow streak — its longest since launch. The move marks IBIT’s largest single-day outflow to date, according to Farside data, following a month where BlackRock added $6.2 billion in Bitcoin. Despite the pullback, IBIT’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at around $70 billion. The outflows were part of a broader trend across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $616.1 million in net redemptions on May 30 — the second consecutive day of outflows. The previous day had seen $346.8 million withdrawn. Notably, BlackRock was the only issuer to post inflows on May 29, even as others saw redemptions.

2025-06-01T10:00:28,"Bitcoin Still Bullish, But $200,000 Off The Table And $137,000 In Sight","Bitcoin’s price action has drawn a sharp dividing line between long-term bullish expectations and short-term reality. After peaking above $111,000 in May, the Bitcoin price has entered a retracement phase and is now trading below $105,000. While some interpret the current downturn as a sign of a weakening trend, others see it as a textbook bullish correction. Among them is crypto analyst MasterAnanda, whose latest chart suggests that Bitcoin is structurally strong enough to reach new highs, but it might fall short of the speculated $200,000 price target this cycle. Related Reading: No Room For Doubt: Analyst’s $900K Bitcoin Forecast Follows Familiar Script MasterAnanda Predicts Higher Low And $137,000 Target In his TradingView post, MasterAnanda stated clearly that Bitcoin is still in a bullish structure, but he believes a $200,000 peak is out of reach for this cycle. Instead, he identified $137,000 as the more realistic upside target when Bitcoin finally rebounds from the ongoing correction. According to the analyst, the formation of a higher low on the larger time frame will be an important confirmation that Bitcoin’s macro uptrend remains intact. He outlined $88,888.88 as an ideal retracement level to make this perfect higher low, because it aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level and comes in well above the prior bottom at $74,500 on April 7. Despite the current sell-off, MasterAnanda argues that the broader trend is healthy. “Bitcoin will never ever trade below $80,000 in its history again,” he declared, ruling out any deep reversal below the prior low. On the other hand, the analyst also noted that if Bitcoin holds above $100,000 to $102,000, this retracement would be considered minor, with price action still classified as bullish continuation rather than a breakdown. If Bitcoin bulls manage to keep prices trading above that area, it would suggest the current move is nothing more than a short-term dip. When that moment arrives, the bias will shift from short to long, and a rally to $137,000. However, a clean break below the $100,000 price level would mark a significant shift in how long Bitcoin reaches new highs. Chart From TradingView: MasterAnanda RLinda Echoes $101,000 Support For Bitcoin Adding to the analysis, another trader, RLinda, shared a 4-hour chart perspective showing how Bitcoin is currently in a fragile recovery path. She agrees that Bitcoin is still operating within a bullish context, but flagged the $102,000 and $101,400 zones as vital structural supports. Her chart suggests that the false breakout at the key $110,000 resistance level is the end of the recent rally leg, and the current decline could be a liquidity-driven correction rather than a complete reversal of the bullish trend. Furthermore, RLinda’s analysis shows that Bitcoin has exited its upward channel. The outcome, she said, will depend heavily on whether support levels at $102,000 and $101,400 can hold. A bounce from these levels could lead to a retest of the $106,000 to $108,000 resistance zone, where market direction may become clearer. If bulls fail to hold $101,000, it could invite a more dramatic sell-off that pushes the Bitcoin price toward a local bottom or even deeper.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah says 41-year-old Kyle Eugene Duncan-Carle has been sentenced to 72 months in prison after he admitted to committing bank fraud. Authorities say that between January and September 2023, Duncan-Carle stole US Treasury checks that were already made out to people or companies and stole their identities to open credit union accounts under their names. He subsequently deposited the checks to be able to withdraw the funds, according to prosecutors. All in all, Duncan-Carle admitted to stealing at least eight Treasury checks totaling $7.97 million. In the end, authorities say the victims, which include the US government, financial institutions and an insurance provider, sustained $3.49 million in losses. Duncan-Carle’s sentence also includes five years of supervised release after his six-year stint behind bars and an order to pay restitution to his victims. He was reportedly arrested in Lyon County, Nevada, last year and charged with bank fraud, aggravated identity theft and receipt of stolen government property.

2025-06-01T09:07:07,"Smart contracts need community intelligence | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. The most promising protocols in crypto today aren’t just algorithmic marvels. They’re designed to harness the collective intelligence of their communities. Having managed both a 5,000-acre vegetable farm and multiple crypto ventures, I’ve watched purely technical approaches consistently fail where community-integrated systems thrive. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion In northern Italy, truffle hunters work in perfect synergy with their trained pigs. The pigs detect valuable truffles through their acute sense of smell, sensing compounds humans cannot perceive. The hunters contribute expertise in identifying promising locations, interpreting signals, and extracting truffles without damage. Neither succeeds alone. This complementary intelligence offers a powerful lesson for crypto protocols. Many are still trying to replace human judgment with algorithms when they should be creating systems that combine both. Protocols that listen outperform Look at Yearn Finance. It didn’t revolutionize DeFi through better algorithms. It created a system that actively integrates community signals into its vault strategies. When unsustainable yield farms emerged during the 2021-2022 DeFi boom, Yearn’s community detected the risks months before they became obvious. The protocol amplified this intelligence, outperforming purely algorithmic approaches. Similarly, Aave’s risk management framework incorporates ongoing community governance to adjust parameters based on subtle market shifts that quantitative models miss. This integration helped Aave weather market turbulence that destroyed less adaptive protocols. The evidence is compelling. During the 2024 election, while traditional polls showed 15-point swings between candidates, prediction markets maintained signals accurate to within two percentage points. When people put actual money behind their predictions, they consistently outperform expert analysis. In protocol performance, the pattern is unmistakable. During the cascading liquidations of 2023, protocols with community-integrated risk systems experienced significantly fewer insolvencies than those relying solely on algorithms ( Gauntlet, 2023 ). Aave, for example, weathered the March 2023 USD Coin ( USDC ) crisis with only minimal bad debt, while algorithmic protocols faced cascading failures ( Chaos Labs, 2023 ). Meanwhile, protocols with active governance, like MakerDAO and Yearn Finance, delivered significantly higher risk-adjusted returns from 2020 to 2024 ( ChainCatcher, 2024 ). I’ve seen this dynamic throughout my years growing up in and around agriculture. The most resilient farming communities don’t just follow models. They draw on generational, regional knowledge to get the most out of their soil and maximize yield over the long term. They know which rotations actually restore fertility in their specific fields, how to manage nitrogen without over-relying on inputs, and which cover crops make sense given local climate and soil type. This isn’t folklore. It’s research-backed, but grounded in lived experience. Top-down agtech platforms and government policies often miss the mark because they assume one-size-fits-all answers. But soil doesn’t work that way. Neither does making a living from it. The knowledge that matters most lives in communities, passed down, adapted each season, and tested over time. Behavioral finance confirms what’s obvious to experienced market participants: algorithms excel in stable environments but falter when fundamental conditions shift. Like a truffle pig trained to find black truffles suddenly hunting white ones, these systems can only detect what they’re programmed to find. Designing for complementary intelligence Creating effective partnerships between algorithms and communities requires intentional design. The most successful protocols incorporate these principles: Transparent observability : Community participants need visibility into system operations. Dashboards, real-time metrics, and clear documentation enable the community to develop pattern recognition capabilities that algorithms might miss. Graduated response mechanisms : Rather than binary on/off switches, effective protocols provide a spectrum of intervention options. Uniswap’s three-tiered fee structure exemplifies this approach, allowing community wisdom to find the right balance for different trading pairs. Sentiment aggregation systems : Beyond formal governance votes, successful protocols capture continuous feedback through multiple channels: forums, Discord discussions, GitHub issues, on-chain behavior. These inputs form an ongoing conversation between code and community. Failure planning : The most resilient systems assume algorithmic failures will occur and design community response systems in advance. These “break glass in case of emergency” mechanisms acknowledge that human judgment becomes most valuable precisely when automated systems reach their limits. By designing with these principles, protocols create space for complementary intelligence to flourish. Algorithms handle routine operations with efficiency while community wisdom addresses complex edge cases and strategic decisions. Finding your edge as an investor For investors, the implications are clear: protocols designed to harness community intelligence offer more sustainable returns. Look for projects that: Integrate governance beyond token voting, capturing community insights continuously. Look for protocols with active forums, responsive Discord channels, and teams that engage meaningfully with user feedback outside of formal governance processes. Demonstrate adaptive strategy shifts based on community signals. Review how the protocol responded to previous market stress events. The best projects show a pattern of preemptive adjustments based on community discussions before problems become obvious to the broader market. Prioritize ecosystem health over maximum short-term yields. This typically appears as conservative risk parameters and sustainable growth rates. Examine how the team handled previous yield opportunities—did they chase maximum returns or maintain prudent safety margins? The most valuable protocols don’t replace human judgment with algorithms. They build systems that combine community wisdom with technical precision, just like the centuries-old partnership between truffle hunter and pig. When millions are at stake, would you trust only the algorithm, or would you prefer a protocol that incorporates the collective wisdom of thousands of engaged participants? The market is delivering its verdict: the most resilient protocols aren’t just code. They’re living partnerships that blend human insight with machine execution. In a market defined by uncertainty, that partnership is becoming the only sustainable edge.

2025-06-01T09:06:00,"BitMEX Uncovers Security Flaws in North Korea’s Lazarus Group Operations","Key Takeaways: BitMEX uncovered major security flaws in North Korea’s Lazarus Group. A rare IP leak exposed a hacker’s location in China. G7 leaders plan to address North Korea’s growing crypto thefts at their upcoming summit. BitMEX’s security team has exposed significant operational weaknesses within the Lazarus Group, the North Korean state-sponsored cybercrime network responsible for a string of high-profile crypto hacks. In a recent counter-operations probe , BitMEX researchers identified technical missteps that revealed parts of the group’s infrastructure. Among the discoveries were exposed IP addresses, an accessible database, and tracking algorithms used by the group in its campaigns. Rare Slip Exposes Lazarus Hacker’s IP Address in China One key finding suggests that a hacker likely exposed his real IP address during an operation, pinpointing a location in Jiaxing, China — a rare lapse for the highly secretive group. Researchers also gained access to a Supabase database instance used by the attackers. Supabase is a platform that simplifies database deployment, and its use by Lazarus highlights the group’s evolving operational tools. BitMEX’s report underscores a growing divide in the group’s internal structure. It notes an “asymmetry” between low-skill social engineering teams, responsible for tricking users into downloading malware, and the more advanced developers creating sophisticated exploits. The fragmentation suggests that Lazarus has splintered into sub-groups with varying capabilities. While some cells rely on basic social engineering, others deploy complex technical attacks targeting the blockchain and tech sectors. North Korea is funding its weapons program with cryptocurrency stolen through cyberattacks. Hackers stole more than $50 million from at least three cryptocurrency exchanges between 2020 and mid-2021, according to a U.N. report https://t.co/EkLEJwPjdj pic.twitter.com/edPXkjsaV3 — Reuters (@Reuters) February 8, 2022 The findings come amid a wider surge in DPRK-linked cyber activity. Global law enforcement agencies continue to investigate the group’s operations. In September 2024, the FBI warned about phishing scams using fake job offers to lure crypto users. That warning was later echoed by Japan, South Korea, and U.S. officials, who labeled Lazarus a threat to financial stability. Now, international concern is growing. A Bloomberg report suggests world leaders may address the Lazarus threat at the upcoming G7 Summit, exploring coordinated strategies to mitigate damage from the group’s activities. With Lazarus remaining an active force in the crypto threat landscape, BitMEX’s findings offer new insights into the group’s operational vulnerabilities — and potential avenues for disruption. G7 to Address North Korea’s Crypto Theft Surge G7 leaders are expected to address North Korea’s escalating cyberattacks and cryptocurrency thefts at next month’s summit in Canada. While global conflicts remain high on the agenda, Pyongyang’s cyber operations, seen as a key funding source for its weapons programs, are drawing urgent attention from member states seeking coordinated action. The Lazarus Group, North Korea’s most infamous hacking collective, is believed to be behind a series of major crypto thefts, including a record $1.4 billion heist from exchange Bybit in February. Chainalysis has claimed that North Korean-linked actors stole over $1.3 billion across 47 separate incidents in 2024 alone. Beyond external hacks, the regime employs rogue IT workers to infiltrate crypto firms from within — a tactic flagged in a joint warning from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. North Korean cyber strategies continue to evolve. In April, Lazarus-linked operatives reportedly set up U.S.-based shell companies to distribute malware to crypto developers. Kraken recently thwarted an infiltration attempt by a suspected North Korean posing as a job candidate.

2025-06-01T09:00:00,"Mogul Club, Ava Labs partner to bring tokenized real estate to web3 investors","As blockchain technology continues to reshape global finance, a new frontier is emerging: tokenized real estate. Mogul Club (stylized as mogul Club)—a platform founded by former Goldman Sachs real estate professionals—is taking a bold step in that direction with the launch of Clubs, on-chain, community-powered investment groups designed to democratize access to premium, income-generating properties. One of the first major collaborations? A partnership with Ava Labs to launch the Avalanche Club, a real estate syndication initiative built for the Web3 community. Through this alliance, developers and users in the Avalanche ecosystem can now pool resources and invest in institutional-grade properties using stablecoins and digital assets—no intermediaries required. To understand how the startup is turning tokenized real estate from concept to execution, crypto.news caught up with co-founder Alex Blackwood. Alex Blackwood, co-founder of mogul Club What was the original vision behind mogul Club, and how has it evolved with the introduction of Clubs? Our original vision behind mogul Club was to democratize premium real estate, traditionally one of the most powerful vehicles for long-term wealth creation, through fractional ownership. Historically, access to institutional-grade property deals has been limited due to high capital minimums, exclusive networks, and knowledge barriers. We aimed to dismantle these barriers by enabling everyday investors and high-net-worth individuals alike to invest fractionally in professionally managed, cash-flowing blue-chip properties. With the introduction of Clubs, our vision has expanded from individual access to fostering community-powered investing. Now, groups such as friends, families, alumni networks, and others can learn and earn together while investing in real estate. Clubs bring a collaborative, social dimension to mogul, empowering communities to build wealth collectively and intentionally. What problems are you solving that traditional platforms don’t address? Clubs represent a fundamental reimagining of the traditional real estate investing model, tailored specifically for a digitally native and community-oriented generation. Traditional investing has typically been exclusive, opaque, and reliant on institutional gatekeepers. Clubs reverse this paradigm by creating a transparent, grassroots-driven approach powered by shared values and collective goals. mogul aims to lead community-led capital formation by allowing groups such as crypto ecosystems, alumni networks, and others to form or join Clubs aligned with their specific interests. Additionally, as Clubs evolve, we are developing premium, customized features designed to meet the investing needs of community organizers and participants. What’s your revenue model? Mogul currently collects revenue through fees structured around our fractional investments. We have a 3% onboarding fee and a 2% setup fee, both capitalized into the deal based on the purchase price of the property. These fees cover expenses related to finding, vetting, and onboarding properties. Additionally, we collect 2.5% of the rental income to manage coordination with property managers and to leverage institutional-level discounts. Importantly, this 2.5% minimally impacts returns and aligns our incentives closely with investors—we do not collect this fee unless investors receive returns. All returns projected on our platform, including IRR estimates, are presented net of these fees. How do you ensure liquidity for investors in tokenized real estate assets? Mogul plans to introduce secondary liquidity options by Q2 2026. Until then, investor liquidity primarily occurs when properties are sold. In the interim, investors benefit from real-time appreciation of their investment, monthly dividends distributed directly to their account, and tax benefits. Are there any regulatory safeguards in place, particularly around tokenized securities? Mogul operates as an investment club and not as a regulated security, so traditional securities regulations do not apply. We implement robust Know Your Customer (KYC) processes to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to identity verification and anti-money laundering. Additionally, our platform is built on Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain technology, using Snowtrace for transparency, and we utilize Fireblocks to securely store users’ wallets and keys. Fireblocks employ stringent security protocols and measures, including secure custody and robust key management, to protect digital assets and ensure their safe transfer and storage. Crucially, investors’ capital is placed directly into the property-owning PropCo LLCs, which means their investments are fully protected even if mogul were to experience operational disruptions.

2025-06-01T08:30:47,"$202 Million In Long Liquidations Rock Bitcoin Market — What’s Next For BTC Price?","Over the weekend, Bitcoin’s price extended its disappointing performance, falling to around $103,000 in the early hours of Saturday, May 31st. While the premier cryptocurrency seems to have recovered fine in the past day, its price is still more than 6% away from the recently achieved all-time high of $111,814. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin price could resume its upward trajectory anytime from now. Mass Long Liquidations Could Mean Sustained Upward Trend For BTC In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci shared that the Bitcoin market witnessed its third-largest long liquidation in the month of May. Data from CryptoQuant shows that $202 million in BTC long positions were liquidated on the Binance derivatives exchange on Friday, May 30th. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Price Doomed For $93K? Technical Indicators Paint A Bearish Image As highlighted by Kesmeci, leveraged trading and speculative pressure ramped up on the world’s largest crypto exchange as the price of Bitcoin rallied from around $94,000 to a new record high above $111,000. These long liquidations typically occur when derivatives traders are forced to close their positions as prices move sharply against them, leading to automatic sell-offs that can further trigger volatility in both directions. The latest event — involving $202 million worth of BTC long positions — is the third-largest in the past month, trailing only two larger liquidations in May: $211 million on May 12 and $277 million on May 23. This series of high-value liquidations reflects the increased speculative activity in the Bitcoin market over the past few weeks. While the investors who suffered this liquidation may feel hard done by the market, these mass liquidations could be positive for the flagship cryptocurrency — a healthy reset for what is starting to feel like an overheated market. By removing excessive leverage, the Bitcoin market can reestablish a more stable foundation for price discovery and a continued upward trend. Bitcoin Funding Rates Still Very Low: Analyst According to another on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost, the Bitcoin funding rates are still at extremely low levels. This trend signals the unwillingness and hesitation of traders to open new long positions, read the post on X. Darkfost added: Typically, when Bitcoin breaks above its previous all-time high, we tend to see a surge in funding rates, signaling that euphoria and risk appetite are back. But that’s not what we’re seeing right now, investors need more clarity before jumping in with conviction. The on-chain analyst stated that this cautious stance of investors could be positive for the Bitcoin price and the upward trend. Moreover, the lack of euphoria reflects a market that is yet to be overheated, with room for further upside growth. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $ 104,897, reflecting a mere 0.2% increase in the past 24 hours.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $104,896 before declining to current levels. BTC has been up almost 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $104,612, as it looks to build momentum and push above $105,000. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy Is Gaining Steam Michael Saylor’s Strategy’s Bitcoin accumulation plan is being copied by media firms, multinational conglomerates, and meme stock companies. However, Wall Street remains skeptical and isn’t buying into the hype. This week, Trump Media announced an ambitious plan to raise $2.5 billion to fund Bitcoin purchases. GameStop also made a $500 million allocation towards Bitcoin purchases, while Tether, Softbank, and Strike’s Jack Mallers announced TwentyOne, a Bitcoin-native public company. The company plans to launch with more than 42,000 BTC on its balance sheet. However, the market doesn’t see any of the firms becoming the next Strategy. Trump Media shares plunged 20% since the announcement, while GameStop is down 17%. Speaking about the market’s reaction to the announcements, Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor stated, “Maybe the market wanted them to buy more bitcoin. But these are short-term dynamics. Over the long term, bitcoin on the balance sheet has proven to be extraordinarily popular.” Saylor called Trump Media’s move aggressive and intelligent, stating, “Everywhere I go at this conference, someone says, you know, I’m working on a bitcoin treasury company in Hong Kong. I’m doing this thing in Korea. I’ve got this thing I’m working on in Abu Dhabi. We’re going to do this in the Middle East, you know, we’ve got this in the U.K.There’s an explosion of interest right now.” IMF Flags Concerns About Pakistan’s Bitcoin Plan The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The plans were announced last week amid ongoing negotiations with the IMF to extend the country’s financial program. However, the IMF has questioned the move and requested urgent clarification from the country’s Finance Ministry regarding the legality of crypto mining and power allocations as the country struggles with chronic energy shortages and fiscal pressures. According to reports, the IMF was not consulted prior to the announcement, prompting it to question the legal standing of cryptocurrencies in Pakistan. It has also voiced concerns over potential impacts on resource distribution and power tariffs. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative. The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the talks.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) continued its decline from recent highs, dipping below $105,000 as sellers gained the upper hand in recent sessions. Analysts predict a deeper pullback to $100,000 will occur before bulls find the momentum to return to the price discovery phase. The flagship cryptocurrency is almost $8,000 below its peak of $111,970. As BTC encountered resistance at multiple levels, on-chain indicators flagged a slowdown in momentum. On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant noted in a report that some Bitcoin demand metrics were reaching a short-term top, indicating a pause in the current rally. The report stated, “CryptoQuant’s estimate of Bitcoin’s demand growth in the last 30 days is at 229K, which is near the previous demand growth top of 279K Bitcoin reached in December 2024. Additionally, whale-held Bitcoin balances have increased by 2.8% over the past month, a pace that often precedes a slowdown in whale accumulation.” Bitcoin (BTC) raced to a new all-time high on Thursday (May 22), racing an intraday high of $111,970 before settling at $111,589. However, it has been downhill since, with the price nearly 4% to $107,356. BTC recovered over the weekend, registering an increase of 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to settle at $109,103. The price registered a marginal increase on Monday but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% and settling at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell .03% and settled at $107,834. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. BTC continued to decline on Friday, falling 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Saturday, rising 0.69% to $104,784. The current session sees BTC marginally down. The MACD shows sellers have the upper hand. If the current downtrend continues, BTC could test the $100,000 support level before bouncing back. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-01T07:57:35,"Bitcoin Analyst Sets $8 to $10 XRP Price. Here’s the Timeline","George Tung, founder of the crypto-focused platform CryptosRUs and a recognized analyst in the Bitcoin space, has recently voiced his expectations for XRP’s future performance. Speaking with Altcoin Daily, Tung stated that XRP could realistically rise to a price between $8 and $10 by the end of 2025. This prediction, which he described as a conservative estimate, is based on the digital asset’s market durability and the increasing involvement of institutional investors. Institutional Growth and Market Trends Tung’s outlook hinges on the belief that XRP is well-positioned to benefit from a broader trend of increased institutional engagement with digital assets. During the interview, he said that recent filings for XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be a catalyst for significant growth. According to him, if any of these products receive approval, they could channel considerable capital into XRP, thereby placing upward pressure on the token’s price. XRP has won the trust of many institutions , and these products could cement its status as highly attractive to institutions. Aaron Arnold, the host, noted that XRP has maintained relevance through multiple shifts in the crypto market. Tung believes this resilience distinguishes it from highly speculative tokens, making it a better option for those who want long-term exposure to digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 High Expectations for XRP in the Current Cycle While discussing other leading cryptocurrencies, Tung made it clear that XRP can outperform the others. He believes Bitcoin could see a 1.5x to 2x increase from current levels, while Ethereum may achieve a 3x to 4x return. However, he expects XRP to deliver up to 5x its current value under favorable market conditions. This suggests a target range of $8.76 to $10.95 based on the asset’s current price of $2.19. Tung also noted that established assets, such as XRP, will benefit from improved market sentiment and a return of capital to altcoins. His broader forecast for the cycle includes a Bitcoin peak between $200,000 and $300,000. In early 2024, veteran trader Peter Brandt predicted that BTC could hit $200,000 by Q3 of 2025 , and this move would set a strong backdrop for gains across the market. Caution on Unrealistic Expectations Tung also warned retail investors against chasing extreme short-term gains, noting that meme coin success is rare despite notable surges of meme coins like PEPE. He urged a disciplined strategy and focus on credible projects with long-term utility. Even former skeptics like Davinci Jeremie now see potential in XRP, with Jeremie suggesting it could hit $24 this year , and Tung advised beginners to allocate most of their funds to fundamentally strong projects.

2025-06-01T07:54:02,"Saylor wants to be on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast","Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor has publicly mentioned that he intends to discuss Bitcoin on one of the most listened-to podcasts in the world, The Joe Rogan Experience. The Strategy man made his intentions known on X after a fan account on the show posed the question. Michael Saylor has been a long-time proponent of Bitcoin, willing to talk about the leading digital asset with anyone who cares to listen. Even at times when it seemed like the world wasn’t listening, he continued to talk about Bitcoin. His company, Strategy has also been committed to their goal of owning more Bitcoin than any other person in the world, with a recent purchase of 4,020 BTC, worth $427 million. The firm has signaled its intention to own more, noting that it will continue to raise capital to purchase more BTC in the future if it needs to. Taking to his X handle, Saylor shot his shot toward the podcast host. “Hey @joerogan, let’s talk about Bitcoin,” Saylor said in a May 31 X post in response to a Joe Rogan fan account asking, “Who’s one guest you’d love to see Joe Rogan interview that he hasn’t had on yet?” Michael Saylor triggers community excitement with his post Saylor’s post seemed to have pumped up the Bitcoin community, with high-profile members of the community praising the move. Crypto analyst Kook told their over 164,000 followers that “Saylor is going to Bitcoin pill Joe Rogan.” While addressing the concerns of a member who mentioned that Joe Rogan might not understand Bitcoin, he said, after a second or third conversation, he expects Rogan to become a massive advocate of the token. Another crypto commentator Brandon McDougal also mentioned that he will be watching his first-ever Joe Rogan podcast if he manages to invite Saylor to the show. Meanwhile, Rogan has frequently talked about crypto and Bitcoin on his podcast, but this might be the first significant shift considering the fact that Saylor has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the sector. Aside from making pro-Bitcoin statements over the years, Rogan mentioned in an episode with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in October 2023 that out of all the digital assets that exist in the market, Bitcoin fascinates him the most. “The real fascinating crypto is Bitcoin. That’s the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency. It’s limited in the amount that it can be,” Rogan said at the time. He added that it fascinates him, saying, “I love the fact that it’s been implemented.” While Joe Rogan has yet to respond publicly to Saylor’s post about coming on the show, there is a likelihood that both of them could discuss a potential appearance on the show in the coming days. Meanwhile, this is not the first time that a personality with a wealth of experience in the Bitcoin community will be making an appearance on the show, with Rogan inviting Bitcoin entrepreneur Andreas Antonopoulos. Antonopoulos made his appearance on the show around 2014 to 2016 when Bitcoin was still eyeing a move above $1,000. Meanwhile, Saylor’s firm has been holding strong in the Bitcoin race, with Strategy now holding up to about 580,250 BTC, worth $60.56 billion according to the Saylor Tracker website . He also recently discussed why Bitcoin is yet to touch close to the $150,000 price mark. He mentioned that holders who do not plan to hold the asset long-term have been selling off their holdings while new investors are currently flooding the market. “I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.

In a chart shared on X, he identifies two symmetrical triangle formations and describes XRP’s next moves as “fantastic.” The first occurred before XRP’s major move last November, and another is currently unfolding, suggesting a repeat of XRP’s performance in November. The next move for #XRP will be fantastic! pic.twitter.com/V8mKAUWsub — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 31, 2025 The First Symmetrical Triangle The previous triangle formed between July and October 2024. XRP spent much of this time consolidating between $0.5 and $0.6 without any sustained breakouts. However, the tables turned when Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. Gary Gensler, the former Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced his resignation shortly after, ending the war against cryptocurrencies. The excitement from these developments ignited a market-wide resurgence. Bitcoin rose above $100,000 for the first time, and XRP broke through notable resistance levels despite the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Surged over 500% to $3.39. XRP’s Current Symmetrical Triangle Steph’s current analysis suggests that the structure of the ongoing consolidation bears a close resemblance to that earlier setup. The implication is that another breakout of comparable magnitude could occur if XRP decisively breaks the current resistance line. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The new symmetrical triangle pattern , shown on a 3-day Heikin Ashi chart, indicates consolidation between support at around $1.90 and resistance just below $2.70. The similarity between the two patterns could signal an imminent move. XRP is currently trading at $2.18, and if it experiences another 500% surge like it did in November, it could climb to a new all-time high of $13.08. Experts have set targets around $15 for the current market cycle, and Steph’s analysis reaffirms these double-digit targets. Whale Activity Reinforces Bullish Expectations Adding to the bullish excitement, a whale recently opened a $1.08 million long position using 12x leverage at an entry price of $2.1336. This shows confidence in the digital asset’s future and suggests whales may be preparing for something big. This combination of positive factors, including the symmetrical triangles, historical similarity, and significant whale positioning, has led many in the community to anticipate a powerful breakout. If XRP can replicate its previous pattern, the coming weeks could deliver explosive price action that mirrors or even exceeds the rally seen in late 2024.

2025-06-01T07:27:26,"These Altcoins Retrace the Most Weekly as Bitcoin (BTC) Calms at $104K (Weekend Watch)","Bitcoin’s price has bounced from the multi-day low registered on Saturday and now sits just inches above $104,000. However, its weekly performance is in the red. Many altcoins have produced even more notable price declines since this time last Sunday, led by DOGE, SOL, SUI, and LINK from the larger caps. BTC at $104K Bitcoin made history last week when it broke its January 2025 all-time high and registered a fresh peak on Pizza Day (May 22) at almost $112,000. However, it started to retrace on the next day when US President Trump outlined a new tariff recommendation against the EU and the asset slumped by several grand to around $107,000. It bounced off at the start of the business week and tapped $110,000. However, another rejection followed at that point, and BTC was pushed down to the $107,000 level once again. The situation worsened as the week progressed and BTC slipped to $105,000 on Friday after Trump blamed China that it had violated the previous trade agreement between the two. Saturday saw another leg down as bitcoin slumped to a 12-day low of $103,000. It has recovered some ground and is above $104,000 now, but it’s still over 3% down on the week. Its market cap has calmed at $2.070 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is well above 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView CRO Defies Market-Wide Trend Most altcoins have posted big losses over the past seven days. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu lead the pack, with massive declines of 15% and 12.6%, respectively. Solana, SUI, and LINK follow suit, with price drops of around 10%. ETH has managed to maintain the $2,500 level, while XRP is down to $2.16 after a 6.7% weekly slump. Further losses are evident from PI, XMR, and PEPE, while CRO has defied the market-wide trend. Cronos’ native token has jumped by 7.5% since last Sunday and sits well above $0.1. The total crypto market cap has dropped by over $250 billion since last week and is below $3.4 trillion on CG now.

2025-06-01T07:04:15,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Warns US Dollar May Fail As the Reserve Currency if These Two Things Happen","The chief executive of financial services titan JPMorgan Chase is issuing a warning about the US dollar, saying that it may fail as a reserve currency under certain conditions. In a new interview with CNBC at the Reagan National Economic Forum, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says the US government is having internal problems with the management of its finances. Dimon says that unless the government gets its act together, the country risks losing its status as a military and economic superpower. “The amount of mismanagement is extraordinary. By state, by city, for pensions – that stuff is going to kill us. I always get asked this question: ‘Are we going to be the reserve currency?’ No. If we are not the preeminent military and the preeminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency. That’s a fact, just read history.” Dimon calls on the US government to act with a sense of urgency and fix its internal issues if the country is to remain the largest economy in the world. “Now, I think we will be [on top]. Warren Buffett will tell you that we’re normally resilient, and I agree with that, [but] I think this time is different. This time, we have to get our act together; we have to do it very quickly.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-01T07:01:14,"The SEC raises legal red flags over staking ETFs","The SEC is raising legal red flags over two proposed crypto ETFs tied to staking rewards, both of which had just cleared initial registration steps. The challenge came Friday evening when the Securities and Exchange Commission told ETF Opportunities Trust — the entity responsible for registering funds managed by REX Financial and Osprey Funds — that the new Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs may not qualify as legal investment companies under federal law. This call into question their ability to list on public markets. Both ETFs aim to give investors access to staking yields by tracking Ethereum and Solana, while also passing staking income back to shareholders. But the SEC said the filings were “improperly filed” and warned that the registration documents might be “potentially misleading” about the funds’ legal status. The funds had claimed they met the definition of an investment company, but the SEC says that’s not a given. In a formal letter sent on Saturday, the Commission said it might take further steps “to ensure compliance with the federal securities laws” if the situation is not resolved. While the funds had technically received effective registration earlier on Friday, meaning they could have gone live at any time, that launch is now stalled. SEC flags ETF structure and staking disclosures Greg Collett, general counsel at REX Financial, said the firm isn’t backing away. “We think we can satisfy the SEC on the investment company question, and we don’t intend to launch the funds until we do that.” REX had hoped to get the products trading by mid-June, according to Greg King, the firm’s founder. Now, everything is paused until the SEC gives a clear go-ahead. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said the Commission’s objection may be specific to the filing strategy REX used. “Even if the SEC doesn’t allow this structure to list, we still believe the more straightforward attempts to allow staking in a US ETF will ultimately be successful,” he said. “It’s a matter of when, not if. But the SEC doesn’t seem to be a fan of the way Rex tried to push these listings through.” This is the second time in just a few months that the SEC has stepped in after a fund tried to go public with a structure it didn’t like. In March, the agency publicly pushed back on a private credit ETF managed by State Street Corp. and Apollo Global Management — the first of its kind — only hours after it listed. That product had to deal with similar regulatory issues around classification. The new staking ETFs attempt to blend traditional investment products with crypto-native features like yield from validating transactions. But the SEC doesn’t consider staking returns to be straightforward income, and is clearly uncomfortable with listing a product that generates money in a way they don’t fully regulate. The legal uncertainty around staking continues to block more complex crypto offerings. Bitcoin ETFs attract billions while gold-backed funds bleed As the SEC slams the brakes on staking products, Bitcoin ETFs are pulling in serious capital. Over the past five weeks, US Bitcoin ETFs have seen more than $9 billion in inflows, led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). On the flip side, gold ETFs have been bleeding money — losing more than $2.8 billion in the same timeframe. This comes as Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,980 earlier this month. That rally followed positive movement on regulatory issues — especially new momentum around a stablecoin bill — and mounting concern over the United States’ fiscal position under President Donald Trump’s second term. Investors are seeing Bitcoin as a hedge, not just a bet. Even though gold is still up more than 25% for the year, it’s down nearly $190 from recent highs. Some analysts see this shift as long-term. Christopher Wood, global equity strategist at Jefferies, said, “I remain bullish on both gold and Bitcoin. They remain the best hedges on currency debasement in the G7 world.” But others aren’t convinced Bitcoin can be counted on during market stress. Critics point out that during major events — like the August unwinding of the yen carry trade — Bitcoin dropped sharply alongside other risky assets. That kind of volatility continues to make the SEC wary of expanding crypto exposure through mainstream investment products like ETFs.
