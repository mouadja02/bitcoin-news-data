CRO is the native asset of the Cronos layer-1 blockchain, which was developed by the exchange Crypto.com. Canary filed an S-1 Form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), proposing an ETF that would offer investors exposure to CRO. If approved, the product would also stake a portion of its CRO holdings to earn rewards. The new S-1 statement represents the latest in a spree of recent ETF filings for Canary, which is also attempting to launch Solana ( SOL ), XRP , Sui ( SUI ), Litecoin ( LTC ), Axelar ( AXL ), Hedera ( HBAR ) and Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) funds. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs for trading last July. Two financial firms, Franklin Templeton and Hashdex, also launched joint BTC-ETH ETFs earlier this year. CRO is trading at $0.102 at time of writing and is up more than 8% in the past 24 hours. By comparison, the overall crypto market cap slumped by more than 4% over the same period.

Pakistan’s Bitcoin integration plans mirror El Salvador’s crypto push, raising concerns. The outcome of the IMF discussions will decide Pakistan’s future in digital asset adoption. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is concerned about Pakistan’s recent plan to hold Bitcoin as a long-term investment. The Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference was the first time the country officially revealed its strategic Bitcoin reserve . This is seen as a significant move for Pakistan in the digital finance sector, although it has raised questions from the IMF. Many have begun discussing if this is the start of “El Salvador 2.0” for Pakistan. The government is investing significant resources in supporting the digital asset industry.

2025-05-31T23:30:08,"Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Dominance Reaches Critical Level Above 64%","Despite the ongoing correction from its recent all-time high, Bitcoin’s dominance over the rest of the market has continued to hold steady in recent days. Notably, Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market has increased steadily in recent days, recently surpassing a significant threshold of 64% and exerting pressure on altcoins across the board. Although Bitcoin itself recently lost the $105,000 support level in the past 24 hours, the altcoin market witnessed dips throughout last week. However, this period of imbalance between Bitcoin and altcoins may not last much longer, especially as technical analysis suggests the dominance reaching 64% might be a turning point. Bitcoin Dominance Taps Resistance: Exhaustion Ahead? Crypto trader Astronomer shared an analysis on X, highlighting the 64% region as a crucial turning point for BTC.D. His chart, which outlines a possible path for Bitcoin dominance, shows that the metric has now entered a wide resistance block between 64.00% and 64.40%. This is important because this is a level that has rejected previous upside attempts throughout the past month. Even with Bitcoin being the only cryptocurrency to print a new all-time high in recent times, the Bitcoin dominance has found it hard to break above 64% in May, which shows that the trend might be becoming exhausted. Notably, after bouncing just above 63.5% on May 28, Bitcoin’s dominance printed a lower high. The current price behavior mirrors those earlier moves, lacking the bullish strength needed to break higher. If the projected path in the chart below plays out, the dominance could range slightly before beginning a rollover that takes it into the lower 63% zone and beyond. The trajectory on the chart suggests the decline could steepen in early June and finally open up the door for altcoins to thrive. Altcoin Momentum Soon With Fading Bitcoin Dominance? The chart outlook indicates that the Bitcoin dominance rally is nearing exhaustion. Despite recent losses across many altcoins, the projection structure suggests an imminent shift and a potential decline in Bitcoin dominance to 63.45%. From here, the next step will depend on how Bitcoin reacts at this level. As it begins to unwind, this decline in Bitcoin dominance will likely coincide with an increase in the price of major altcoins, particularly in large market-cap altcoins like Ethereum , Solana, and Dogecoin. As such, this moment of topping out could finally be the early stages of a broader altcoin season. At the time of writing, data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin’s dominance is currently at 63.5%, just above the crucial 63.45% point. A breakdown of Bitcoin’s dominance at this point could cascade into an altcoin season. Ethereum, on the other hand, has seen its dominance increase by 2.01% in the past 24 hours to 9.4% at the time of writing. However, the notion of a close altcoin season could crumble if Bitcoin dominance manages to make a monthly close above 64%.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/altcoin-season-incoming/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Altcoins|Altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin Season|altcoins|Altcoins news|Astronomer|bitcoin|Bitcoin dominance|BTC.D|Coinmarketcap|dogecoin|Ethereum|solana",cryptocompare

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T22:00:53,"Pepe Makes It To Trump’s Feed—Is A Crypto Endorsement Next?","US President Donald Trump’s brief post on Truth Social on May 29 sparked a quick burst of excitement among crypto traders. Based on reports, some users saw a hidden reference to the Pepe meme coin (PEPE). Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ In the next few hours, PEPE shot up by 5% but then fell back by 15%. Traders are now watching to see if this social push can do what Elon Musk once did for Dogecoin. Pepe Price Moves According to market data, PEPE’s price hit its upper resistance after the Trump post. A short surge brought a 5% gain. Then profit-taking and wider market pressure drove an 18% correction. The flip in momentum shows how fast things can change in meme-coin land. A small tweet or post can send prices soaring, but it only takes a bit of selling to push them down again. 🚨 Wait, what Trump just dropped a $PEPE pic on Truth Social 🚨 Is this a secret crypto endorsement or just trolling the internet? Either way the $PEPE rocket might just have a new co-pilot. What’s next a $PEPE rally or a Twitter melt down Stay tuned👀 pic.twitter.com/cu8RF7D55b — Josh Mair (@WizzOfCrypto) May 29, 2025 On Drama & Speculation Trump’s message saying he’s “on a mission from God” makes him sound like he has a special purpose, not just a political goal. The dark street scene and the words “nothing can stop what is coming” hint that something big is coming, even if he doesn’t explain it. This kind of talk can fire up his most loyal supporters – especially PEPE aficionados – because it feels dramatic and urgent. Chart Patterns In Focus Based on reports from chart watchers, PEPE appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern that began about five months ago. If the coin breaks above the handle, some say it could reach $0.000026—double its current level. Right now, the MACD line sits below the signal line after a recent death cross, hinting at a near-term downtrend. The RSI has dipped toward 52 and may cross below it soon, which could keep sellers in control. The 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level sits at $0.00001 and could act as a bounce point. If that level gives way, traders will look at $0.000008 as the next support. Tariff Ruling Adds Pressure Based on US Court of International Trade filings, the court reversed Trump’s tariff suspensions right around the same time that PEPE spiked. That move seems to have dampened the market’s risk-on mood. For many traders, broader trade news can be a bigger factor than any single tweet. If traders worry about tariffs and slower growth, they often sell off riskier assets like meme coins. That mix of social hype and market worry helped push PEPE down after its brief rally. Looking Ahead For Traders Based on this mix of social buzz and chart signals, it’ll take more than a hint in a post to keep PEPE climbing. If the coin can break above its current resistance by mid-June, $0.000026 seems to be the main target. But a falling MACD and RSI point toward more selling pressure first. Traders should watch the 0.618 level at $0.00001 for signs of a bounce. If that level breaks, they’ll likely aim for $0.000008 next.

MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.196, resulting in a correction to $0.16. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price down today? Manta price has triggered a strong bearish rally toward $0.22. This occurred after buyers failed to maintain the buying pressure around local tops. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option.

2025-05-31T21:06:19,"Czech justice minister steps down over $45M BTC gift from darknet ex-convict","Czech Republic Minister of Justice Pavel Blažek has resigned after reports emerged that the Justice Ministry collected Bitcoin donations from an ex-convict. The ministry announced the donations, stating that they had sold the BTC. According to reports , the ministry had accepted a donation of 480 Bitcoins worth around 1 billion Czech Koruna (over $45 million) from Tomáš Jiřikovský, who previously served four years in prison. Jiřikovský was convicted for operating the darknet platform Sheep Marketplace, where users bought drugs and other illegal items. However, the platform stopped operating in 2013, which many considered an exit scam, as the operators disappeared with users’ money. It was not until 2016 that Jiřikovský would be arrested for the incident with a wallet containing over 1,500 Bitcoins found on his computer, according to authorities. He was eventually sentenced to prison for drug trafficking and embezzlement. Blažek’s decision to accept the donation despite the donor’s checkered history has landed him in hot water. Opposition parties have been especially critical of his actions, with speculations of money laundering since he did not know the origin of the funds. The bad press surrounding the incident appeared to be the major factor in the minister’s resignation. Although he has continued denying any wrongdoing, he said he resigned to prevent a negative impact on Prime Minister Peter Fiala’s coalition government. Interestingly, Blažek is a close ally of Fiala, with the two belonging to the same Civic Democratic Party. With the parliamentary election set to happen in October, there are concerns that the incident could further worsen the chances of the incumbent government , which many have already predicted would lose the election. Blažek defends Bitcoin donations Despite his decision to resign, Blažek has defended the ministry’s acceptance of the funds, noting that it was fully legal and would go towards improving the justice system. He highlighted several ways the ministry would use donations, including digitizing the justice system, improving housing conditions for prison staff, and helping fight drugs. According to him, Jiřikovský likely donated the funds to show remorse. He is reported to have said: “Why should a convicted person not be allowed to give something to the state, for example, as a form of penance?” Unsurprisingly, Prime Minister Fiala said that he believed the Justice Minister had acted in good faith and praised his decision to resign. However, many suggest there might be more to the donation than Blažek claims. According to reports , Jiřikovský has been trying to recover the Bitcoins the government seized from him upon his arrest. Although he claimed that he had obtained them legally, which entitles him to keep them, investigations at the time suggested they might be connected to another darknet marketplace, Nucleus. Nucleus shut down the day Jiřikovský was arrested. Czech authorities are investigating the donation Interestingly, Jiřikovský’s lawyer had reached out to Blažek to negotiate the return of the seized assets with an agreement that one-third of the funds would be donated to the ministry. The minister reportedly agreed. This eventually led to the signing of an agreement and the movement of Bitcoin, which was connected to Nucleus, to another wallet in March after being dormant for almost 10 years. While Blažek insisted that he had no interest in the case, which happened long ago, the circumstances around the incident continue to raise eyebrows. Meanwhile, Czech legal authorities are investigating the Bitcoin donation to determine the source of the funds. Given Jiřikovský’s past, there are concerns that the funds might be part of money laundering from criminal activity. According to reports , the National Headquarters for Combating Organization is investigating the incident, while the Public Prosecutor Office for Olomouc is separately probing whether the minister, as a public official, exceeded his powers.

2025-05-31T20:29:28,"IMF Raises Red Flags Over Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining & AI Energy Plan","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns over Pakistan’s latest Bitcoin (BTC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) energy plan. This announcement follows the country’s establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, alongside other partnerships, in recent months. Pakistan’s pro-crypto stance has left the community elated, being among the countries to make a swift turn backing the market. IMF Wants Clarity: Report According to local news outlets, the IMF flagged Pakistan’s recent announcement by its pro-crypto task force to allocate 2000 megawatts of electricity to Bitcoin and AI data centers. The organization seeks clarity on its legality as major power shortages plague the country. This development comes amid sensitive budget talks between both parties as Pakistan looks to integrate digital assets into its economy. According to sources familiar with the matter, the government is yet to disclose a formal framework to the IMF, while the latter stressed that all policy steps under the External Fund Facility must be considered. Additionally, a delegation is expected to hold a separate session on the plan to provide electricity to Bitcoin and AI centres. “ There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative. The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the ongoing talks,” a source added. On May 25, Pakistan’s crypto task force allocated 2,000 megawatts of electricity to Bitcoin mining, seeking to attract foreign investment. Backed by the Finance Ministry, the move is expected to drive employment and generate revenue following massive global adoption of the asset class. The government also plans tax cuts and incentives for miners and AI firms. Bilal Bin Saqib, Task Force Chief Executive, explained that the decision was a turning point for the country’s economy. Pakistan’s Pro-Crypto Stance This year, Pakistan has become increasingly bullish on Bitcoin, contrary to its previous policies on the asset class. The country rolled out a Digital Asset Authority tasked with tokenizing government assets and licensing crypto platforms. Notably, the crypto task force launch and appointment of Changpeng Zhao as an adviser drew institutional attention. At the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, Saqib announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve inspired by the United States’ decision. So far, President Trump remains committed to his promise of clear and favourable policies to the sector. For most commentators, it is the driving force behind massive institutional adoption.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/imf-raises-red-flags-over-pakistans-bitcoin-mining-ai-energy-plan/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|IMF",cryptocompare

Bitcoin experienced a significant decline of -37.28% in June 2022, one of its worst drops. The recurring weak performance in June has led to cautious behavior among Bitcoin investors. June is a challenging month for Bitcoin, raising concerns among traders. Historical data shows that the cryptocurrency often brings disappointing returns in June. Many investors have become concerned about this trend. Since this has happened many times, traders are wondering if it will keep going. According to historical data, Bitcoin’s price fell by 3.18% in June 2020, and in June 2021, it decreased by 5.95%. The situation worsened in June 2022, when the price of Bitcoin declined by 37.28%.

At an event organized by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, Dimon told regulators that the full effect of all the money printed since 2020 remains to be seen. “You are going to see a crack in the bond market. It is going to happen. And I tell this to my regulators, some of you who are in this room, I’m telling you it’s going to happen and you’re going to panic. I’m not gonna panic. We’ll be fine. We’ll probably make more money, and then some of my friends will tell me, ‘We like crises because it’s good for JPMorgan Chase.’ Not really.'” Dimon says bond vigilantes are back, selling bonds to protest unsustainable fiscal policies and America’s ballooning debt. In the long run, Dimon says he’s not too worried about China as a potential adversary, and instead believes the US needs to self improve and erase the “enemy within.” “If we are not the preeminent military and the preeminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency. That’s a fact. Just read history… We we have to get our act together and we have to do it very quickly.” Dimon says a concerted effort to streamline regulations, immigration, taxation, healthcare and schools is needed. He also reiterated his dissatisfaction with Bitcoin’s emergence as a strategic reserve asset. “We shouldn’t be stockpiling Bitcoin.

2025-05-31T19:07:07,"Is Bitcoin’s $103,000 Plunge the Start of a Crypto Meltdown?","According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin’s price slipped to $103,700, a 2% drop over 24 hours. This comes just days after it hit an all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. At the same time, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $616 million in outflows, led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw $430.8 million redeemed, ending its 31-day inflow streak. Is this a healthy market correction or the start of a broader crypto downturn? Bitcoin ETF Outflows Signal Changing Sentiment On May 30, the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw $616.1 million leave their funds according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock’s IBIT alone accounted for $430.8 million—the largest single-day outflow since its January 2024 debut. Just a week earlier, these same ETFs pulled in $2.75 billion for the week ending May 23, a 4.5× increase from the $608 million of the prior week . ETF analyst Nate Geraci noted on X that IBIT has now amassed roughly $70 billion in Bitcoin holdings since launch, calling the recent fund flows “ridiculous.” Kyle Chasse of Master Ventures said the outflows are not driven by retail panic but rather reflect a “quiet transfer of supply to the strongest hands.” Source: X These outflows coincide with Bitcoin’s pullback from its May 22 peak. After surging to $111,970, BTC briefly traded near $108,141 on May 23 before sliding toward $103,700 on May 30. ETF flows and price action appear tightly linked; heavy redemptions placed downward pressure on spot markets, reversing mid-May gains. Bitcoin’s late-May drop also reflects broader macroeconomic factors. On May 30, the total cryptocurrency market cap fell 2.12% to $3.34 trillion. Investors cite renewed geopolitical tensions and U.S. economic concerns as reasons to reduce risk exposure. High Treasury yields and talk of inflationary headwinds have slowed appetite for volatile assets. In traditional markets, the S&P 500 slipped 0.7% on May 22 while Bitcoin hit $111,970, showing a rare decoupling between stocks and crypto. However, equities and crypto felt pressure by the month’s end. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell from 78 (“Extreme Greed”) on May 22 to 66 (“Greed”) by May 30, signaling a slight cooling of investor enthusiasm. Bitcoin has a history of sharp corrections after rapid rallies. After climbing from $60,000 to $69,000 in October 2021, BTC plunged 20% in two days, retracing gains before consolidating. Similarly, following its $69,000 peak in November 2021, BTC fell below $50,000 by January 2022—over a 27% drop. The May 2025 dip to $103,700 marks roughly a 7% pullback from the $111,970 high. That is modest compared to past corrections. Nonetheless, it underscores Bitcoin’s volatility. Analyst Crypto Dan of CryptoQuant pointed out that funding rates remain low relative to previous peaks, suggesting limited leverage-driven excess. What’s Ahead for Bitcoin Price? Traders will watch ETF flows closely in early June. If outflows persist, they may signal waning institutional demand, potentially dragging BTC lower. BTC/USDT Daily Chart| Source: TradingView However, many see the late-May redemptions as a temporary rotation rather than a wholesale exit. As Kyle Chasse noted, supply is shifting to long-term holders, which could support price stability once selling subsidies. Upcoming U.S. macro data—especially the June 13 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report—and any Federal Reserve commentary on interest rates will be crucial. A dovish Fed could buoy risk assets, including Bitcoin. Conversely, hotter-than-expected inflation data might prompt another pullback. On the technical side, traders are eyeing $100,000 as key psychological support. Below that, the next major support zone lies near $94,000, the mid-April low. If BTC holds above $100,000, it may reclaim momentum and attempt new highs. Failure to hold could open the door to a deeper correction. For now, Bitcoin’s $103,700 dip appears more like a correction than a meltdown. Institutional flows have swung rapidly, but large holders seem poised to absorb supply.

2025-05-31T19:00:04,"Can Dogecoin Price Still Rally 1,000%? Analyst Reveals End-Of-Year Prediction","A crypto analyst has forecasted a potential 1,000% rally for the Dogecoin price by the end of the year, suggesting that the leading meme coin could not only reach the coveted $1 milestone but blast past it to $2. While this target may seem bold, especially with Dogecoin still trading below $0.5, the analysis is backed by a compelling combination of historical price behavior, market structure, and accumulation patterns. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ Dogecoin Price Targets $2 By Year’s End According to a 2-day chart analysis published by crypto market expert ‘Setupsfx_‘ on TradingView, Dogecoin has been navigating a textbook accumulation phase reminiscent of previous cycles that preceded explosive price surges. Based on this distinct historical price behavior, the analyst is boldly predicting a major breakout, anticipating a 1,000% rally that could allow the meme coin to smash through $2 by the end of the year. Using the Wyckoff theory as a foundation, the TradingView expert presented a chart illustrating a clear structure of accumulation, distribution, markdown, and markup—- all of which have played out in past market movements. The chart shows that Dogecoin followed a typical Wyckoff accumulation in its early 2021 cycle, where it traded sideways and spent months consolidating in a defined range. This range, indicated by the blue box on the chart, has been highlighted as a key buy zone between roughly $0.12 and $0.16. Notably, this key zone is the final area where the Dogecoin price could be revisited before launching higher. A return to this range would complete the historical price structure and present an ideal entry point before the markup stage begins. Currently, Dogecoin has concluded its markdown phase and is approaching the final stages of accumulation, paving the way for a potential bullish breakout. If price action continues to respect this historically bullish roadmap, Setupsfx_ forecasts that Dogecoin could gradually move higher over the coming months. By late 2025, this could culminate in a full-blown rally to $2, a level that represents approximately 1,000% upside from current prices. While the TradingView analyst maintains a bullish stance on Dogecoin’s outlook, he has tempered expectations, cautioning that the journey to $2 isn’t expected to be linear. Dogecoin could still face volatility, retracement, and psychological resistance around levels like $0.25, $0.5, and $1, which could slow down its climb. A Push Above $3 Still In The Cards Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade on X (formerly Twitter) is even more bullish on Dogecoin’s future price, projecting a potential rally to $3.8. This optimistic forecast is supported by the emergence of a bullish Ascending Broadening Wedge pattern on Dogecoin’s weekly chart. Six key touch points confirm the pattern, labeled A through F, within a widening channel indicated on the price chart. The critical level to watch is the $0.47 resistance level, marked by the previous high around point E. Related Reading: $10 Million Fix? SUI Network Moves Fast After Cetus Exploit Scare A confirmed breakout above this level could validate the wedge and potentially trigger a significant price surge.

In 2027, it will range between $9.26 and $11.49, with an average price of $9.60. In 2030, it will range between $28.31 and $34.81, with an average price of $29.16. Toncoin (TON) has risen 20.32% over the last 30 days and is up 662% since its inception. Looking ahead, TON is anticipated to trade higher. It will cross the $10 mark in 2027 and the $20 mark in 2029. TON (The Open Network) is a decentralized protocol designed by Telegram and created by the community. The protocol is designed as a distributed supercomputer, or “super server,” that consists of TON Blockchain , TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. The native token for the network is called Toncoin. “Will TON ever go up? Can TON reach the $10 mark? Where will TON be in five years?” These are the questions traders and investors ask. Let’s answer them and more in our Toncoin price prediction.

The move came as Bitcoin retreated from $105,000. After reaching the local high of $6 in early December, the TON price steadily declined. On Tuesday, March 11, it dropped beneath the $2.5 mark for the first time in over a year. Afterwards, it started recovering, albeit gradually. It recovered this month and reached a high of $3.50. Looking at its DeFi ecosystem, TON’s Total Value Locked (TVL) dropped by 4.73% in the last 24 hours to $157 M. TON/USD 1-day chart price analysis TON/USD 1-day chart. Image Source: TradingView Despite a falling TVL and low price momentum, Toncoin remained range-bound this week, closing above the $3.0 mark. Notably, the relative strength index is at 47.76 in neutral territory. TON/USD 4-hour chart price analysis TON/USD 4-hour chart. Image Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that TON is in a bear run as it corrects from the month’s high. The downward trend of the moving averages suggests it will drop over the short term. The William Alligator trendlines show that the coin’s volatility is rising. Notably, its negative momentum is dropping.

Our chart analysis shows the current sentiment is neutral and that its negative momentum is dropping, meaning it should move sideways over the short term. Recent news Telegram’s deal with xAI, which would see Elon Musk’s AI company integrate into Telegram is a work in progress despite an announcement from Pavel Durov. While Durov confirmed that the deal is yet to be signed, the Telegram founder said there is an “agreement in principle,” which might be why TON still has significant support at the $3.0. Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Why is TON up? The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market, which saw Bitcoin rise above $100,000. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Will TON reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. Does Toncoin have a future? TON has had a bullish run since its inception despite seasonal market corrections.

Vance spoke at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, outlining how he plans to turn the country into the “cryptocurrency capital of the world.” Vice President Vance stated that the Trump administration will fire officials who hinder the crypto industry, describing the crypto market as a key sector for the U.S. economy. Want to stay up to date with the top crypto events? Subscribe to our weekly newsletter and get the most important news straight to your inbox! Gensler isn’t the first official to be dismissed, and he likely won’t be the last According to Vance, the lack of clear regulation for the crypto market could lead to trillions of dollars flowing to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Vance emphasized that the U.S. needs to draft legislation to fully integrate cryptocurrencies into the national economy, rather than restricting the industry. “If we don’t create transparent rules now, this $3 trillion industry will go overseas,” he said. The vice president said there should be no officials remaining in government positions who oppose digital assets. He mentioned Gary Gensler, the former head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who left the agency immediately after Trump’s inauguration in January. “We’ve already fired Gary Gensler, and we’re going to fire anyone who shares his stance,” Vance said, hinting at upcoming personnel changes among financial regulators. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, known for his friendly approach to the crypto market, as the new head of the SEC. Atkins has already announced that the agency will overhaul its approach to regulating the crypto industry and will seek to make the U.S. the “cryptocurrency capital of the world.” The Commission recently created a task force on cryptocurrencies, headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce. She is known in the crypto community as “Crypto Mom.” Peirce said that the SEC will first focus on revising the classification of crypto assets. The regulator’s Digital Asset Working Group has already held three roundtables on digital assets. During the most recent one, which took place on May 12, commissioners discussed moving assets to blockchain and tokenization. The next meeting is scheduled for June 6. The main topic will be the development of decentralized finance in the U.S. Key Facts The Bitcoin 2025 conference was held in Las Vegas, where crypto industry leaders and government officials met. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance said that the Trump administration will fire all officials hindering the development of the crypto market.

The Minneapolis-based sports marketing company is joining others attempting to mirror the Bitcoin strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy). SharpLink Is Amassing Ether As A Treasury Reserve Asset In a May 30 filing, SharpLink Gaming said it plans to sell up to $1 billion in shares of common stock to purchase more ether for its treasury. “We intend to use substantially all of the proceeds from this offering to acquire Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain commonly referred to as ‘ETH,’” the filing reads. SharpLink also aims to use some proceeds from this offering for working capital, general operating expenses, and affiliate marketing operations. The capital raise follows the company’s May 27 announcement that it would be creating an Ether-based corporate treasury strategy. SharpLink Gaming nominated Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lupin as chairman of its board of directors. The MicroStrategy Of Ethereum SharpLink joins a growing roster of microcap companies trying to mimic the success of Strategy, the first publicly traded company to adopt a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy, leading to an over 2,400% growth of its share price since it started buying the leading cryptocurrency in 2020. Before spot Bitcoin ETFs became a multi-billion-dollar hit on Wall Street, MicroStrategy (now known as simply Strategy) embarked on a quest to become one of the asset’s largest corporate holders. The Michael Saylor-led company currently owns 580,250 Bitcoin , valued at $60.7 billion, as the price of BTC now hovers around $114,400. This is equivalent to 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Crypto analyst 0xBoboShanti quipped in an X post, “Ethereum finally has its own Saylor.” Meanwhile, Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano posited , “You are not bullish enough.” Ether is trading at $2,541 at press time, down 2.3% on the day, according to CoinGecko data.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/sharplink-gaming-is-raising-1-billion-to-buy-more-ethereum-for-its-massive-treasury-bet/,"BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX","Cryptocurrency|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

Two new Ethereum and Solana-focused ETFs planned to be launched by REX Financial and Osprey Funds have received initial registration approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), raising new questions about the funds’ legal status. The SEC said the funds in question may not meet the definition of an “investment company” under federal securities laws, meaning they fail to meet one of the basic legal requirements for being listed on an exchange. SEC officials said in a letter to the issuer of the ETF Opportunities Trust that the two ETFs may have been falsely registered as “investment companies” and that the statements they made may have been misleading. The funds aimed to allow investors to earn staking rewards on cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana. Related News: What to Expect in Bitcoin in June? Expert Analysts Share Their Predictions “We believe we can address the SEC’s concerns regarding the investment company definition and do not plan to float the funds until this issue is resolved,” REX Financial General Counsel Greg Collett said in a statement. The SEC declined to comment beyond the letter’s content. “Even if the SEC doesn’t allow this structure to be listed, we believe that simpler ETF attempts that include staking will eventually be successful. It’s just a matter of time. But the SEC doesn’t seem to like the way REX is moving these applications forward,” said James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. This is the SEC’s second overt crackdown on ETFs that invest in alternative asset classes in recent months. In March, the SEC publicly criticized the world’s first ETF investing in the private credit market, offered by State Street Corp. and Apollo Global Management, just hours after it began listing. REX announced yesterday that it had received “active registration” for the two ETFs in question and that the funds could now be traded on the exchange. REX founder Greg King stated that both funds were planned to be launched in mid-June. “Until these concerns are addressed, appropriate steps will be considered to ensure compliance with the federal securities laws,” the SEC said in its letter. *This is not investment advice.

Dimon stated during a May 30 appearance at the Reagan National Economic Forum in California that the United States should prioritize defense logistics over stockpiling Bitcoin. US Should Focus On Essential Resources Like Ammunition and Rare Earths “We shouldn’t be stockpiling Bitcoins,” Jamie Dimon opined, reiterating his long-standing criticism of the foremost cryptocurrency. This comes after President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order in March, mandating the establishment of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. The Bitcoin Reserve will initially consist of the coins seized by the government in civil and criminal forfeitures. The president also called for a crypto stockpile of other types of assets beyond Bitcoin. But according to the anti-crypto billionaire banker, real-world defense logistics, not crypto assets, should take priority. Specifically, he suggested the US should prioritise “guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, and rare earths.” “If there’s a war in the South China Sea, we’ve got missiles for seven days. That’s not something we should be saying with a straight face,” Dimon explained. Dimon’s Bitcoin Bashing History Dimon has long been critical of Bitcoin, asserting at one point that the OG crypto’s “true use case” was for criminals. He also dubbed Bitcoin “a fraud,” and last year described it as a “pet rock,” before declaring he’d “shut it down” if he were the government. But now, likely due to client demands, the bank will allow customers to buy it. He announced earlier this month that JPMorgan clients will soon be able to buy it, though the bank will not custody the asset. At the time, he clarified that he’s still “not a fan” of Bitcoin, mainly because of its use for illegal activities, including sex trafficking and money laundering. He also dismissed the industry’s hype around blockchain technology, claiming it’s less important than it’s made out to be.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-detractor-jamie-dimon-urges-us-government-to-stockpile-missiles-instead-of-btc/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Jamie Dimon",cryptocompare

This bold move signals a dramatic shift in corporate treasury strategy and has reignited speculation about the next wave of institutional crypto adoption. GameStop’s $513 Million Bitcoin (BTC) Move Redefines The Corporate Treasury Game GameStop’s declaration on May 28 that it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoin (BTC) for $513 million has aligned it with major players, such as MicroStrategy and Tesla. This decision followed a March update to its treasury policy and a $1.3 billion convertible notes issuance. GameStop's CEO, Ryan Cohen, during the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, dubbed Bitcoin (BTC) superior to gold, citing its fixed supply and digital security. The market reaction was volatile as GameStop stock surged 6.6% in pre-market trading but closed the day down by nearly 11%. At $107,883 as of May 29, Bitcoin (BTC) remains relatively stable, with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump forecasting highs exceeding $170,000 if corporate adoption continues. Crypto Twitter lit up, memes flourished, and financial analysts began drawing parallels between Bitcoin’s (BTC) institutional acceptance and the early dot-com boom. GameStop’s pivot has added fresh momentum to crypto’s march into mainstream finance.

IBIT witnessed over $430 million in outflows on May 30, a reversal after 31 consecutive days of positive accumulation. Investors Pull $430.8 Million From BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Investors pulled $430.8 million from BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF on Friday amid flaring tensions between the U.S. and China over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. It was IBIT’s biggest single-day net outflow since its launch, according to data from U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Before this, IBIT’s largest outflow day was on Feb. 26, bleeding $418.1 million in investor money. Nate Geraci, the president of investment advisor ETFStore, observed in a May 31 post on X, “What a run over the past 30+ days, though.” Geraci pointed out that BlackRock’s IBIT is now pushing approximately $70 billion in Bitcoin assets under management since its debut — continuing to assert its dominance in the market. “Not sure I have words to describe how ridiculous this is,” he posited. Overall, the dozen US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs as a whole posted net outflows for the second consecutive day on May 30, totaling $616.1 million. The latest pullback came as global economic tensions rattled financial markets, triggering a cascade of liquidations and pulling prices below key support levels. Bitcoin was trading hands at around $104,140 at publication time, according to CoinMarketCap data. Just nine days ago, the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency was trading at all-time highs of nearly $112,000. The volatility comes after U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating a bilateral trade pact, forcing him to double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% to protect domestic industries. Trump claimed China broke a May agreement to ease trade tensions, adding that he might discuss the issue with President Xi Jinping. The President also announced new tariffs on Canada and Mexico, reigniting trade war fears and sending ripples across financial markets.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-ibit-snaps-31-day-winning-streak-with-largest-outflow-ever-amid-tariff-angst/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Blackrock",cryptocompare

In a new press release , the DOJ is announcing charges against six individuals connected to a “sprawling” scheme that hauled in $66 million in food stamps by allegedly abusing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The suspects – Michael Kehoe, Mohamad Nawafleh, Omar Alrawashdeh, Gamal Obaid, Emad Alrawashdeh, and Arlasa Davis – are charged with conspiracy to steal government funds and with misappropriating U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) benefits, among other charges. Authorities say that starting in 2019, Kehoe and his co-conspirators allegedly submitted fraudulent applications to obtain machine terminals that accepted payments from SNAP recipients for unauthorized places, such as smoke shops. SNAP recipients use specialized payment cards to purchase food at stores. According to the press release, Kehoe set up 160 illegal terminals across New York and processed millions of dollars worth of fraudulent EBT (Electronic Benefit Transfer) transactions. One of the members of the group – Davis – worked for the USDA and is suspected of using her position to acquire and distribute a list of license numbers for qualifying stores, which allowed the thieves to illegally obtain EBT terminals for stores not authorized by the USDA. In return, she received bribes disguised as gifts. As stated by U.S. Attorney Perry Carbone, “Michael Kehoe and his co-conspirators misappropriated tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds meant to help low-income families put food on the table. This fraud was made possible when USDA employee Arlasa Davis betrayed the public trust by selling confidential government information to the very criminals she was supposed to catch. Their actions undermined a program that vulnerable New Yorkers depend on for basic nutrition. These charges should be a reminder that those who exploit anti-poverty programs for personal gain will be held accountable for their crimes.” If convicted, the suspects face decades behind bars.

2025-05-31T18:35:11,"BlackRock IBIT's 30-day streak ends with $400 million outflow, BTC ends May on a low","BlackRock iShares Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) IBIT has experienced its first day of outflow in more than 30 days, with $400 million in value exiting from the ETF and ending its streak. The outflow followed a recent decline in BTC value, which saw its price below $105,000. According to data from Farside Investors , IBIT saw a total of $430.8 million outflows on a day that other spot Bitcoin ETFs also bled funds. Fidelity FBTC and Bitwise BITB recorded $13.7 million and $35,3 million outflows, respectively, while Ark Investments 21 Shares ARKB had a negative $120.1 million flow. While the IBIT outflow ends its no-outflow streak, analysts consider the run impressive for the product, which has been around for less than 18 months. ETF Foundation president Nate Geraci praised it. He said: “What a run over the past 30+ days though. Not sure I have words to describe how ridiculous this is.” However, IBIT’s outflow was unsurprising, given that all the other funds have experienced multiple days of outflows this month. In fact, the combined net outflow of $347 million for Bitcoin ETFs on May 29 had already ended the two-week streak of consecutive inflows for the asset class, making the eventuality of an IBIT outflow inevitable. With the massive outflows from IBIT , the 11 Bitcoin ETFs finished May 30 with a combined outflow of $616.1 million, one of the biggest daily outflows in over a month. Still, the streak of inflows and the few outflows highlights Bitcoin’s positive performance in May, during which it reached a new peak. IBIT AUM is now above $70 billion despite the BTC decline Meanwhile, IBIT now has over $70 billion in assets under management (AUM) despite the recent outflows, enough to rank 23rd on the list of top 100 ETFs. This performance has shattered all expectations about spot Bitcoin ETFs and shows how the product has outdone even the most bullish prediction at the time of their approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the next youngest ETF in the top 25 has been around for 12 years, showing IBIT’s significance. The around $6.5 billion in inflows in May for IBIT is a monthly inflow record and contributed to the over $70 billion AUM milestone. Interestingly, spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively pulled in over $9 billion in inflows over the last five weeks. This sharply contrasts with the almost $3 billion that flowed out of gold ETFs, further showing that investors view Bitcoin as a hedge asset different from gold. Cumulatively, Bitcoin ETFs have seen a net inflow of around $45 billion since their launch. This is still impressive, given that Grayscale GBTC has seen an outflow of $23.21 billion since its conversion into an ETF. What is next for Bitcoin? With Bitcoin down more than 4% in the last seven days and dropping to $104,000 after peaking around $112,000, investors are observing the crypto market’s next move. The general sentiment among analysts is that the bull run is not over yet, and BTC might still have more room to run. According to Cryptoquant analysts, the conditions for Bitcoin are still bullish even though some metrics are already overheating. The firm stated that its Bull Score Index is currently at 80 and expects the flagship asset to keep rallying until the score is below 50. However, the analysts noted that Bitcoin demand growth seems to have reached a local top after the 30-day demand growth estimate reached 229,000 BTC, close to 279,000 BTC, which marked the top in December 2024. Interestingly, the Bitcoin balance held by whales also increased by 2.8% last month. Such rapid increase has historically preceded reduced accumulation, which could mean less buying pressure to push prices further up. Nevertheless, many believe that the demand for BTC remains very strong. Appolo Sats founder Thomas Fahrer noted that the Bitcoin double-top in 2025 is nothing compared to similar double peaks in price in 2021. This is because BTC’s recent performance is supported by demand from the ETF, treasury companies , and sovereign states that have established BTC reserves. Bitcoin Net Realized Profit & Loss remains limited despite recent peak (Source: CryptoQuant) Crypto analyst Crypto Dan also believes Bitcoin will continue the upward cycle and points to the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit and Loss (NPRL) metric as evidence. He stated that the current level of profit-taking is lower compared to previous highs in 2024. Thus, its effect would likely be a price correction in the short term rather than a complete reversal of the upward cycle.
