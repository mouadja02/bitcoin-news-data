2025-07-11T22:30:51,"Bitcoin Price Dominance: Decoding the Altcoin Lag and Future Crypto Market Rally","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing, but not in the way many might expect. While Bitcoin price has once again defied expectations, smashing through its previous all-time highs and setting new records, a curious phenomenon is unfolding across the broader market. Despite Bitcoin’s triumphant ascent, a significant portion of the altcoin market remains surprisingly subdued, exhibiting what many are calling a distinct altcoin lag . This unusual divergence raises crucial questions for investors and enthusiasts alike: Is this a sign of a healthier, more sustainable rally, or a precursor to further market shifts? Let’s delve into the data and unravel what this unique market dynamic truly signifies for the future of cryptocurrency trends . Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Phenomenon Bitcoin’s journey to a new all-time high has been nothing short of spectacular. This latest surge has cemented its position as the undisputed leader of the crypto realm. Data cited by The Kobeissi Letter, referencing Sentimentrader on X, highlights this dominance starkly: despite Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high, nearly 0% of other cryptocurrencies are trading within 5% of their respective 252-day highs. This statistic underscores a highly concentrated rally, where capital seems to be flowing almost exclusively into Bitcoin. What’s driving this singular focus on Bitcoin? Several factors are at play: Institutional Inflow: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large investment firms, pension funds, and wealth managers now have a regulated, accessible vehicle to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which was previously challenging. This influx of significant capital naturally prioritizes the most liquid and established asset. Halving Narrative: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, continues to be a powerful narrative. Historically, halvings have preceded major bull runs, creating anticipation and driving demand. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a ‘digital gold’ – a hedge against inflation and traditional financial instability. This perception attracts a broader range of investors seeking a safe haven. First-Mover Advantage: As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin possesses unparalleled brand recognition, network security, and liquidity, making it the primary choice for new capital entering the crypto space. The Curious Case of Altcoin Lag : Why Aren’t They Following? The stark contrast between Bitcoin’s stellar performance and the subdued state of altcoins is perplexing to many. In previous bull cycles, a Bitcoin rally typically served as a precursor, pulling the entire market upwards, with altcoins eventually experiencing even larger percentage gains. So, why the current altcoin lag ? The Sentimentrader statistic – almost zero altcoins within 5% of their 252-day highs – paints a clear picture of underperformance. Here are key reasons contributing to this divergence: Liquidity Concentration: The immense capital flowing into Bitcoin ETFs has absorbed a significant portion of the new money entering the crypto market. This means less liquidity is immediately available to trickle down into altcoins. Investors are opting for the most direct and regulated exposure to the asset class, which is currently Bitcoin. Risk Aversion: During the initial stages of a bull market, or when macroeconomic conditions are uncertain, investors tend to be more risk-averse. They prefer to allocate capital to Bitcoin, perceived as the safest and most established crypto asset, before venturing into the higher-risk, higher-reward altcoin space. Lack of Dominant Altcoin Narratives (Yet): While some altcoin sectors like AI, DePIN, or Real World Assets (RWAs) are gaining traction, a broad, compelling narrative that captures widespread retail and institutional attention for altcoins, similar to Bitcoin’s ETF story, has not fully materialized. Market Maturity: The crypto market is maturing. Institutional participants are more discerning. They conduct deeper due diligence, focusing on fundamental value, regulatory clarity, and sustainable tokenomics, rather than simply chasing speculative gains across all altcoins. Phased Market Cycles: Historically, crypto bull markets unfold in phases. Bitcoin often leads the charge, followed by large-cap altcoins (like Ethereum), and then smaller-cap altcoins and meme coins. The current market might simply be in the ‘Bitcoin-first’ phase. Historical Context: Past Rallies and Bitcoin All-Time High Behaviors To understand the current market, it’s crucial to look at historical precedents. Past rallies often provide clues, though every cycle has its unique characteristics. The original report notes that in previous rallies, Bitcoin highs coincided with stronger altcoin performance, citing examples where 75% (likely referring to the Feb 2021 period) and 40% (perhaps Nov 2021) of altcoins showed robust gains. Consider the 2017 and 2021 bull runs: 2017 Bull Run: Bitcoin’s initial surge to its then all-time high was followed by an explosive ‘altcoin season’ in early 2018, where many altcoins saw parabolic gains, some even outperforming Bitcoin significantly. 2020-2021 Bull Run: Bitcoin broke its 2017 high in late 2020 and continued its ascent into 2021. This was again followed by a broad altcoin rally, particularly strong in spring 2021, driven by DeFi, NFTs, and other emerging narratives. Ethereum, in particular, saw substantial growth. The current cycle, while exhibiting Bitcoin’s leadership, shows a more pronounced and prolonged altcoin lag at this stage. This suggests a potentially more deliberate and perhaps more institutionally-driven market. The ‘smart money’ might be consolidating positions in Bitcoin before strategically diversifying into select altcoins with strong fundamentals or compelling narratives. Navigating the Crypto Market Analysis : What Does This Divergence Mean? This unusual divergence between Bitcoin and altcoins presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. A thorough crypto market analysis is essential to interpret these signals correctly. Potential Interpretations: More Upside for Bitcoin: The initial report suggests that the current divergence implies Bitcoin’s rally may still have room to run. If altcoins haven’t caught up yet, it could mean that the broader market has not yet reached its peak euphoria phase, and Bitcoin’s ascent is still in its primary stage. A Healthier, More Sustainable Rally: Some analysts argue that a Bitcoin-led rally, rather than a speculative altcoin frenzy, indicates a more mature and sustainable market. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin provides a strong foundation, potentially leading to less volatile, more gradual growth across the ecosystem. Impending Altcoin Season: Many seasoned investors view the current lag as a sign that an ‘altcoin season’ is merely delayed, not canceled. Once Bitcoin consolidates its gains or its momentum slows, capital could rotate into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Increased Market Bifurcation: It’s also possible that the market is becoming more bifurcated, with Bitcoin establishing itself as a premier, lower-risk asset, while altcoins remain a higher-risk, higher-reward play. This could lead to a permanent shift in how different segments of the crypto market behave. Actionable Insights for Investors: Patience is Key: For altcoin holders, patience may be paramount. Historical patterns suggest that altcoins often follow Bitcoin’s lead, albeit with a delay. Strategic Rebalancing: Consider rebalancing portfolios. If Bitcoin has significantly outperformed, taking some profits and reallocating to fundamentally strong altcoins that have lagged could be a strategy, assuming you believe in their long-term potential. Focus on Fundamentals: When considering altcoins, prioritize projects with strong technology, clear use cases, active development, and robust communities. Avoid purely speculative plays. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to use DCA strategies to accumulate positions in both Bitcoin and chosen altcoins, mitigating volatility risks. Risk Management: Understand that altcoins carry higher risk. Diversify your altcoin holdings and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Future Cryptocurrency Trends : What to Expect Next? Predicting the future of cryptocurrency trends is always challenging, but the current market dynamics offer some clues about potential paths forward. The divergence between Bitcoin and altcoins sets the stage for several interesting scenarios: Rotation into Large-Cap Altcoins: Once Bitcoin’s initial surge cools, capital may first rotate into established large-cap altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and others with significant ecosystems and development activity. Ethereum’s upcoming upgrades, particularly those related to scalability and efficiency, could serve as a major catalyst. Sector-Specific Rallies: Instead of a broad altcoin season, we might see more targeted rallies in specific sectors that are gaining traction. This could include AI-related tokens, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), GameFi, or Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization projects. Investors will need to be highly selective. Increased Volatility for Altcoins: As capital moves more strategically, altcoins might experience more pronounced swings. Those with weak fundamentals or limited utility could struggle to regain their previous highs, while strong projects could see significant gains. Regulatory Impact: The evolving regulatory landscape will play a crucial role. Clearer regulations could attract more institutional money into altcoins, while uncertainty could continue to dampen enthusiasm. Innovation Driving Adoption: Continued innovation in blockchain technology, such as advancements in layer-2 solutions, cross-chain interoperability, and user-friendly applications, will be critical for driving broader adoption and, consequently, altcoin growth. The market is constantly evolving, and staying informed about these potential shifts is paramount. The current Bitcoin-led rally could be laying the groundwork for a broader market expansion, but it may unfold differently than in past cycles, demanding a more nuanced investment approach. In conclusion, while Bitcoin’s ascent to new highs is a cause for celebration among its holders, the accompanying altcoin lag is a notable characteristic of the current market cycle. This divergence, as highlighted by Sentimentrader, suggests that while Bitcoin may still have significant upside potential, the broader market’s full rally might be yet to come, or it may unfold in a more selective and mature manner than previously observed. Understanding the forces driving Bitcoin’s dominance and the reasons behind altcoin’s current underperformance is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto landscape. Patience, strategic analysis, and a focus on fundamental value will be key for investors looking to capitalize on the next phase of cryptocurrency trends .

2025-07-11T22:30:41,"XRP ETF Race Heats Up: Why July 14, July 21, And July 25 Are Important","The XRP ETF conversation is no longer just speculation , and many industry participants and investors are on high alert. Interestingly, there are a string of important regulatory deadlines falling in July that might influence when and how an XRP ETF will hit the market. A recent post by Crypto Crusader Nick on the social media platform X draws attention to the significance of this month. The post highlights the flurry of ETF activity and upcoming XRP fund filings. At the heart of the discussion are three major dates: July 14, July 21, and July 25, each marking the potential debut or decision deadline for different XRP futures and spot ETFs. ProShares Leads XRP Futures ETF Push ProShares is at the forefront with three XRP futures ETF proposals, all pending regulatory greenlights. Particularly, the ETF issuer is planning to launch three XRP futures ETFs, aiming for a July 14 debut, following an April postponement. The products, the Ultra XRP ETF, UltraShort XRP ETF, and Short XRP ETF, had initially been postponed but are now back on track, as confirmed by the SEC’s acknowledgement of their filings. These ETFs are designed to give both long and inverse exposure to XRP price movements. Unless the SEC raises objections before the deadline, ProShares expects to move forward with all three ETFs on July 14. If approved on schedule, ProShares could set a precedent for futures-based XRP investment products in the United States, making this date the first critical checkpoint in the July ETF rush. The second wave arrives on July 21, with two issuers entering the spotlight. Volatility Shares is preparing to launch its 2X XRP ETF, which aims to provide an amplified 2x exposure to XRP’s daily price movements. July 21 also marks the first listing and trade day for Volatility Shares’ standard XRP ETF. Simultaneously, Tuttle Capital is aiming to bring its 2X Long XRP Daily Target ETF to market. According to filings and updates, both firms have received SEC acknowledgment, with the necessary forms filed and effective for launch by the target date. When Spot XRP ETFs? Although the SEC has allowed several XRP futures-based ETFs to start trading, it has yet to approve any spot-based versions. The final and perhaps most critical date for XRP ETFs in July is on July 25, when the SEC is expected to decide on the REX-Osprey XRP ETF, which is a spot ETF, rather than a futures-based one. This is notable because a green light would mark one of the first Spot XRP ETFs approved in the US market. However, the first Spot XRT ETF could start trading this month unless the SEC steps in. That would represent a major shift in regulatory tone, especially given the SEC’s prior resistance to XRP’s legal status . Other major players such as Bitwise, 21Shares, and CoinShares are also in line with their spot XRP ETF filings, which could follow suit if the REX-Osprey decision sets a favorable precedent.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-race-heats-up/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|21Shares|Bitwise|CoinShares|Crypto Crusader Nick|Proshares|REX-Osprey|ripple|ripple news|Spot XRT ETF|Ultra XRP ETF|US SEC|XRP futures ETF|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

Pulte has reacted to reports that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is considering resigning. Pulte posted on his official X account that he is encouraged by the reports of Chair Powell considering to resign. “I’m encouraged by reports that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. I think this will be the right decision for America, and the economy will boom,” Pulte noted . The Beef Between Chair Powell and President Donald Trump Although not officially confirmed, the reports that Fed Chair Powell is considering to resign stems from the misalignment with the Donald Trump administration. In the past few months, President Trump has urged Chair Powell to lower the interest rates to bolster the country’s economic growth. “Tech Stocks, Industrial Stocks, Nasdaq, hit all-time high, record high! Crypto through is the roof, Nvidia is up 47% since Trump tariffs. USA is taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs … .The Fed should rapidly lower rates to reflect this strength,” Trump noted on TruthSocial. According to President Trump, the Fed ought to have cut its benchmark rate by 3 points, since the inflation has declined. However, the Fed Chair has reiterated several times that the tariffs will likely increase inflation amid weakening U.S. dollar. What Next for Crypto? If Fed Chair Powell resigns in the coming days as predicted by Pulte, President Trump will replace him with his team members.

2025-07-11T22:20:11,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Reveals Explosive Upside Potential","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as Bitcoin continues its remarkable journey. After reaching an unprecedented all-time high, many are wondering: what’s next for the king of crypto? A recent insightful observation from a prominent industry expert suggests that the stage might be set for even greater heights. This isn’t just about celebrating past achievements; it’s about understanding the underlying market dynamics that could propel Bitcoin into a new phase of growth. Prepare to delve into the fascinating world of market indicators and expert analysis that points towards significant Bitcoin upside potential . Unlocking the Mystery: What Drives Bitcoin Upside Potential? In a recent revelation that has sparked considerable discussion across the crypto community, Jeff Park, the astute head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, shared a compelling perspective on Bitcoin’s current market standing. Despite Bitcoin unit price recently establishing a new all-time high, Park highlighted several intriguing observations on X (formerly Twitter): Low Open Interest: This suggests that there isn’t an excessive amount of speculative capital currently tied up in Bitcoin derivatives contracts. A low open interest can indicate that the market isn’t overheated with leveraged bets, leaving room for fresh capital to enter. Low Implied Volatility: Implied volatility reflects the market’s expectation of future price swings. When it’s low, it suggests that options traders are not anticipating large, sudden movements. While counterintuitive, this can sometimes precede significant price action, as the market might be underestimating an impending shift. Low Liquidity: A market with low liquidity means that large orders can have a more significant impact on price. While it can lead to increased volatility during sell-offs, it can also amplify upward movements if strong buying pressure emerges. Park succinctly summarized his analysis, stating, “All you need is a catalyst. No promises, but the probability is [Bitcoin goes] higher now than at any point this year.” This statement is a powerful beacon of hope for many investors, suggesting that the current calm might be the precursor to a storm of positive price action. It implies that the foundational elements for a substantial move are in place, awaiting the right trigger. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Outlook: What Do the Indicators Say? Understanding the broader crypto market outlook requires more than just glancing at price charts. It involves deciphering complex market indicators that offer clues about investor sentiment and potential future movements. Jeff Park’s analysis zeroes in on three critical metrics that, when combined, paint a picture of a market poised for a significant shift, rather than one on the verge of exhaustion. Why Low Open Interest Matters Open interest (OI) represents the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts (like futures or options) that have not yet been settled. High open interest often correlates with high speculative activity and can sometimes signal an overheated market, vulnerable to a sharp correction. Conversely, a low open interest, as observed by Park, can indicate a less crowded trade, meaning there’s less leveraged money that needs to be flushed out. This leaves ample room for new capital inflows to drive prices higher without immediate resistance from over-leveraged positions. The Significance of Low Implied Volatility Implied volatility (IV) is derived from the prices of options contracts and reflects the market’s expectation of future price fluctuations. When IV is low, it means options are cheaper, and traders are not pricing in large swings. Historically, periods of low implied volatility have often preceded significant price movements in Bitcoin. It’s akin to a coiled spring – a period of relative calm before a powerful release. This “calm before the storm” scenario suggests that the market might be underestimating Bitcoin’s true potential for an upward surge. The Double-Edged Sword of Low Liquidity Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without significantly impacting its price. Low liquidity means that even relatively small buy or sell orders can cause noticeable price movements. While this can exacerbate downward pressure during corrections, in an environment ripe for a catalyst, low liquidity can amplify upward momentum. If a wave of buying interest emerges, the limited supply available at current prices can quickly push Bitcoin’s value higher, creating a powerful virtuous cycle. Decoding Bitcoin Price Prediction: Are We Headed Higher? The core of Jeff Park’s statement lies in his Bitcoin price prediction : the probability of Bitcoin going higher now is greater than at any point this year. This isn’t just a hopeful wish; it’s an assessment based on the confluence of these specific market conditions. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding the methodology behind such predictions is crucial. Analysts like Park often look for divergences between price action and underlying market health indicators. When Bitcoin hits a new all-time high, but speculative metrics like open interest and implied volatility remain subdued, it suggests that the rally isn’t fueled by irrational exuberance or excessive leverage. Instead, it implies a more organic, sustainable growth, potentially driven by spot market demand and long-term conviction. Consider the following: Healthy Consolidation: The current market structure might be a period of healthy consolidation after reaching an ATH, rather than a top. This allows new buyers to enter and previous holders to take profits without crashing the market. Reduced Speculative Overhang: With low open interest, there’s less risk of a massive cascade of liquidations if the price were to dip slightly, making the market more resilient to minor corrections. Anticipation of Catalysts: The market is effectively a dry tinderbox, waiting for a spark. Potential catalysts could include: Further institutional adoption (e.g., new ETF approvals, corporate treasury allocations). Significant regulatory clarity or positive legislative developments. Macroeconomic shifts favoring scarce assets (e.g., inflation concerns, weakening fiat currencies). Technological advancements or network upgrades (though less direct for BTC price action, it can boost overall crypto sentiment). Embracing the BTC All-Time High: A Foundation for Future Growth? Reaching a BTC All-Time High is often seen as a significant psychological and technical milestone. For some, it signals the peak, while for others, it’s merely a stepping stone. Jeff Park’s analysis suggests the latter. Instead of being a point of exhaustion, this ATH, coupled with the subdued derivatives market, might represent a robust foundation for the next leg up. Historically, Bitcoin has often consolidated after hitting new highs before embarking on further parabolic runs. What makes this particular ATH different, according to Park, is the absence of the typical speculative frenzy that often accompanies such milestones. This indicates that the current price discovery is perhaps more fundamentally driven, allowing for a more sustainable climb. Key takeaways from the current ATH scenario: Indicator Current State (per Park) Implication for Upside Open Interest Low Less leverage, more room for fresh capital. Implied Volatility Low Market underestimating future price moves, coiled spring. Liquidity Low Amplifies price movements with strong buying pressure. Price Action New All-Time High Strong underlying demand, not overleveraged. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Analysis? The insights from Jeff Park, coming from Bitwise – a prominent institutional crypto asset manager – carry significant weight. His perspective offers a glimpse into how sophisticated players conduct their institutional crypto analysis . For institutional investors, risk management and understanding market structure are paramount. The observations of low open interest, implied volatility, and liquidity are not just technical points; they are crucial signals for deployment of large capital. Institutions typically seek markets that offer both potential for growth and manageable risk. A market that has hit an ATH but isn’t showing signs of speculative overheating can be particularly attractive. It suggests that the price appreciation is more “real” and less prone to sudden, violent corrections driven by leveraged liquidations. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor not just price, but also key on-chain and derivatives metrics. Risk Management: While the outlook is positive, market volatility is inherent. Always practice sound risk management, including setting stop-losses and only investing what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s journey is often characterized by significant corrections within broader bull markets. A long-term perspective often yields the best results. Identify Catalysts: Keep an eye on potential catalysts mentioned earlier, as these could be the triggers for the next major move. Are There Any Challenges or Counterarguments? While Jeff Park’s analysis is compelling, it’s essential to consider potential challenges. The crypto market is inherently unpredictable. A “catalyst” might not materialize as expected, or unforeseen macroeconomic events could shift sentiment. Regulatory crackdowns, significant exchange hacks, or sustained FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) could also impact price action. Moreover, low liquidity, while amplifying upside, can also amplify downside if a strong selling wave emerges. Investors should always conduct their own due diligence and consider a balanced perspective. Conclusion: The Path Ahead for Bitcoin Jeff Park’s insightful analysis from Bitwise provides a powerful bullish argument for Bitcoin’s immediate future. By highlighting the subdued nature of speculative indicators despite a new all-time high, he paints a picture of a market that is consolidating healthily and preparing for its next major move. The low open interest, implied volatility, and liquidity suggest a market that is not over-leveraged, but rather poised for an “explosive” surge once the right catalyst emerges. While no one can promise future returns, the confluence of these factors significantly enhances the probability of further Bitcoin upside potential . As Bitcoin continues to mature and gain wider acceptance, understanding these nuanced market signals becomes increasingly vital for navigating its exciting journey.

2025-07-11T22:00:17,"BTC Digital Unveils Bold $1M Ethereum Reserve for Strategic Growth","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant news as Nasdaq-listed blockchain firm , BTC Digital (BTCT), makes a strategic leap forward. In a move that underscores growing institutional confidence in digital assets, the company has announced the establishment of a substantial $1 million Ethereum reserve . This bold step isn’t just about accumulating digital currency; it’s a clear signal of their ambitious digital asset strategy aimed at scaling operations and solidifying their position in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. What Does a $1 Million Ethereum Reserve Mean? For a publicly traded company like BTC Digital , setting up an Ethereum reserve signifies more than just holding a cryptocurrency. It represents a calculated investment and a diversification of their treasury assets. Historically, companies have held traditional fiat currencies or gold as reserves. However, as the digital economy matures, forward-thinking entities are increasingly looking to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) for various strategic advantages. Strategic Asset Holding: ETH is not just a digital currency; it’s the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain, a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and NFTs. Holding ETH provides exposure to this vast ecosystem. Operational Flexibility: An Ethereum reserve can potentially be used for future investments, liquidity provisions for decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives, or even as collateral for borrowing in the crypto space. Market Confidence: Such a move from a Nasdaq-listed blockchain firm can instill confidence among investors, signaling a long-term commitment to the digital asset space and a belief in its future growth. Why is BTC Digital Betting on Ethereum? The decision by BTC Digital to allocate $1 million specifically to Ethereum is particularly noteworthy. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines for institutional adoption, Ethereum’s ecosystem offers unique functionalities that appeal to companies focused on technological innovation and scaling. Ethereum’s robust network, active developer community, and its pivotal role in the DeFi and NFT sectors make it an attractive asset for a blockchain firm looking to expand its operational capabilities and embrace future trends. This strategic allocation reflects a nuanced understanding of the crypto market beyond mere price speculation. It suggests that BTC Digital sees Ethereum as a foundational technology for their scaling efforts, potentially integrating ETH into their services or using it to fuel future blockchain-based projects. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption BTC Digital ‘s move is part of a broader trend of increasing institutional crypto adoption. What was once considered a niche or speculative asset class is now becoming a legitimate component of corporate treasuries and investment portfolios. From MicroStrategy’s significant Bitcoin holdings to Tesla’s past forays into crypto, and now BTC Digital ‘s Ethereum reserve , the landscape is shifting. This trend is driven by several factors: Factor Description Inflation Hedge Some institutions view cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Diversification Adding digital assets can diversify traditional portfolios, potentially reducing overall risk. Technological Innovation Companies want to be at the forefront of emerging technologies like blockchain and Web3. Market Opportunity The potential for significant returns in a rapidly expanding market. The entry of more regulated and publicly traded entities like BTC Digital lends credibility to the entire digital asset space, paving the way for even wider acceptance. Crafting a Resilient Digital Asset Strategy For any company venturing into cryptocurrencies, a well-defined digital asset strategy is paramount. BTC Digital ‘s establishment of an Ethereum reserve is a prime example of a deliberate and calculated approach. This isn’t a speculative gamble; it’s an integration of digital assets into their core business plan for scaling and future growth. Key components of a robust digital asset strategy often include: Clear Objectives: Defining why the assets are being acquired (e.g., treasury diversification, operational use, investment). Risk Management: Implementing protocols for security, custody, and volatility management. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the evolving legal and regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies. Long-Term Vision: Aligning digital asset holdings with the company’s overarching business goals. BTC Digital ‘s move highlights the importance of a strategic, rather than reactive, approach to crypto adoption for businesses aiming for sustainable growth. What’s Next for BTC Digital and the Crypto Market? The establishment of this Ethereum reserve by BTC Digital is likely to be watched closely by other companies considering similar moves. It sets a precedent for Nasdaq-listed blockchain firm s to integrate significant digital asset holdings into their financial strategies. As the institutional embrace of crypto continues, we can anticipate more companies exploring not just Bitcoin, but also Ethereum and other promising altcoins, as part of their diversified digital asset portfolios.

2025-07-11T22:00:05,"Bitcoin Breaks $118,000—But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns","Bitcoin has set a new all-time high (ATH) above $118,000, but on-chain data from Glassnode shows BTC volume remains low despite the breakout. Bitcoin Volume Still At Historically Low Levels Just recently, Glassnode had revealed that volume related to Bitcoin had dropped to yearly lows, potentially hinting at the start of a summer lull. Now, following the breakout to new highs, the on-chain analytics firm has shared updated data in a reply to an X user, showcasing how volume has changed since. From the chart, it’s visible that both the Spot and Futures Volumes, corresponding to Bitcoin trading activity occurring on the spot and futures platforms, respectively, plummeted at the end of June and remained low into early July. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle—Next Stop $164? With the latest price breakout, however, both metrics have seen an increase, suggesting activity has noted an uplift across both the spot and futures markets. That said, while there has indeed been an uptick in trading, volumes still remain low when compared to history. Historically, rallies have usually only been sustainable when they have been able to capture mass attention from the traders. This is because the fresh activity is what ends up providing fuel for these runs to keep going. “The takeaway here is that BTC hit an ATH despite thin liquidity – worth paying attention to,” notes the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen whether the activity increase would continue in the coming days or if the lull is here to stay. In some other news, a key Bitcoin indicator still remains outside the euphoria zone, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. The metric in question is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) of the long-term holders. The NUPL measures, as its name suggests, the net amount of unrealized profit or loss that the BTC investors are currently holding. Here, the NUPL of the long-term holders (LTHs) specifically is of interest, who are the investors holding their coins for more than 155 days. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin LTH NUPL over the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin LTH NUPL has observed a rise alongside the latest price rally as LTH profits have grown. However, despite this, the indicator stands at 0.69, which is under the 0.75 level that has historically separated euphoric markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Not Just Hype—$4.4B Inflows Back The Move “This cycle has seen just ~30 days above the 0.75 threshold, compared to 228 days in the previous cycle,” says the analytics firm.

In a post on the X (formerly Twitter) platform today, Hayes claimed that a “monster altcoin season” will begin in the market. Hayes, who has long maintained a cautious stance, has now completely reversed this view and announced his ultra-bullish outlook. According to Hayes, the primary drivers of this new era will be market indicators and political developments in the US. His statements have resonated widely with both investors and analysts. Related News: Watch Out: Grayscale Announces the Possible Addition of 29 New Altcoins to its Investment Products - There Are Big Surprises, Here's the List Hayes had previously warned that the Treasury General Account (TGA) fill, the US Treasury Department's process of rebuilding cash reserves at the Fed, could pressure risky assets by draining liquidity from the market, which he argued could weaken short-term market sentiment. However, this week's sudden surges have virtually dispelled these concerns. Bitcoin's consecutive new highs in just two hours prompted Hayes to reassess the market. Hayes noted that Ethereum has also gained significant momentum during the same period, suggesting that the leading altcoin could be the precursor to a strong altcoin season. Hayes also highlighted market expectations that US President Donald Trump might soften his stance on tariffs. Using the humorous phrase “TACO” (Trump Always Chicken Out), Hayes argued that this policy could also create an environment favorable for risky assets. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T20:42:27,"Bitcoin’s breakout isn’t about the Fed, it’s about market structure: analysts","Bitcoin’s record-breaking climb past $118,000 isn’t tied to Fed policy or equities. Instead, analysts say spot ETF demand and corporate treasury strategies are driving this historic move. Meanwhile, altcoins are surging in BTC’s wake. Bitcoin ( BTC ) shattered its previous all-time high of $116,000 on July 11, peaking at $118,872 before settling near $117,300, pulling a 3% daily gain that masked the frenzy beneath the surface. Ethereum ( ETH ) outpaced BTC with a 7% surge, reclaiming $3,000 for the first time since February, while memecoins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) posted double-digit rallies. According to Thomas Perfumo, Kraken’s global economist, Bitcoin is “breaking a months-long range” and entering fresh territory for price discovery. Perfumo noted that over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours alone, while Bitcoin dominance slipped slightly—a rare sign that altcoins are leading the charge. “Concurrently, strength in U.S. equities, currently trading at or near all-time highs, is showcasing a robust risk-on environment, a supportive backdrop for crypto,” Perfumo said in a statement obtained by crypto.news on Friday. With Bitcoin dominance dipping to 54%, the market is witnessing a rare convergence, one where institutional accumulation and derivatives chaos fuel gains across the board, not just at the top. The question now isn’t whether macro matters, but whether crypto’s market mechanics have permanently decoupled from traditional triggers. You might also like: DDC announces $100m Bitcoin treasury partnership with Animoca Brands Market structure, not macro, is steering the rally What distinguishes this rally from previous surges is its foundation. Analysts aren’t pointing to central banks or macro volatility as the spark. Instead, they’re watching structural flows inside the crypto market itself, most notably the direct impact of spot ETF demand. Bitcoin ETFs logged their biggest single day of inflows in 2025 on Thursday, pulling in $1.18 billion, according to SoSoValue data . Ethereum ETFs followed suit with their second-strongest performance of the year at $383 million. These are not speculative futures bets or proxy trades through microcap equities. They are direct, capital-intensive commitments to spot assets. Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, views the breakout through that lens. “In my view, this isn’t a macro-driven rally, but rather an isolated event. That said, recent U.S. policy developments such as fiscal expansion and expectations of further monetary easing have created a backdrop that is undeniably favorable for Bitcoin. We’re seeing Bitcoin treasury strategies proliferate across companies, which reflects growing institutional confidence in BTC as a balance sheet asset,” he also said in a statement sent to crypto.news. Sondergaard emphasized that Bitcoin’s clean break through key liquidation levels, and its ability to hold above them, acted as a trigger point for this latest market-wide rally. What comes next hinges on sustainability. Past rallies relied on macroeconomic tailwinds. This one is testing whether crypto’s internal mechanics, such as ETF flows, corporate adoption, and derivatives markets—can independently support valuations. If so, we may be witnessing the birth of a new market paradigm, one where crypto writes its own rules.

2025-07-11T20:30:03,"Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 – Price Magnet Forming","Ethereum just broke above the critical $3,000 level, marking a major technical milestone after surging over 20% since Tuesday. This decisive breakout signals renewed strength in the second-largest cryptocurrency, with bulls reclaiming control after weeks of tight consolidation. The move is reigniting interest across the broader altcoin market, which had remained relatively muted during Bitcoin’s recent rally to all-time highs. Now, with ETH leading the charge, many altcoins are showing signs of reversal and upward momentum. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level – Relief Or Reversal? According to top analyst Ted Pillows, a key factor behind Ethereum’s rally is the large concentration of liquidity resting just above the $3,000 mark. Once Ethereum cleared the $2,850 resistance, momentum rapidly accelerated, driving price through the $3,000 level and into a new range of opportunity. This rally comes amid a broader shift in market sentiment. As Bitcoin sets record highs, Ethereum and other altcoins appear poised to catch up. The big question now: can ETH maintain this level and lead a full altcoin season, or is this just a temporary breakout before another round of consolidation? Ethereum Breaks Out Of Consolidation Range Ethereum has spent the last several weeks consolidating within a clearly defined range that began in early May. The altcoin hovered between support around $2,800 and resistance just below $3,000, with multiple failed attempts to break above. That changed yesterday. ETH finally closed above this key resistance, signaling a potential breakout and confirming the start of a new bullish phase. This move comes as broader macroeconomic conditions improve. Strong labor market data in the US, alongside signs of de-escalation in several global conflicts, have helped reduce uncertainty and reignite risk appetite across financial markets. With Bitcoin reaching new highs and risk-on sentiment returning, Ethereum’s breakout may signal the next wave of upside for altcoins. Top analyst Ted Pillows highlighted a key technical factor: “ETH liquidity is lying above $3,000 — and liquidity is a magnet.” This means that large clusters of buy and stop orders are concentrated above this level, attracting price movement toward those zones. Now that Ethereum has broken past resistance, the presence of high liquidity could accelerate its move upward as traders chase momentum. The breakout also holds symbolic weight. It shows that investors are regaining confidence in Ethereum’s value proposition, particularly with the broader altcoin market showing signs of life. If ETH can hold this breakout and establish $3,000 as new support, the next leg higher could materialize quickly, opening the door to targets in the $3,400–$3,600 range. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason ETH Breaks Major Resistance Ethereum (ETH) has decisively broken above the psychological and technical resistance at $3,000, closing its most recent candle at $3,008.97. This breakout follows a strong 15% daily surge, as seen in the chart, marking a powerful move backed by growing bullish momentum. Volume has expanded significantly, confirming trader conviction and institutional participation in this move. The breakout puts an end to nearly two months of sideways action, with ETH previously locked between the $2,500–$2,850 range. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently near $2,796, was breached with strength, acting as a springboard for price acceleration. The reclaim of this moving average adds technical validation to the breakout and signals the beginning of a new bullish leg. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves ETH is now in a key zone for potential continuation. As long as bulls defend the $2,850–$2,900 level as support, Ethereum has room to rally toward $3,400 and beyond. With Bitcoin trading at all-time highs and macro conditions turning favorable for risk assets, ETH could lead the next wave of altcoin expansion.

2025-07-11T20:20:57,"Ethereum ETFs See Inflow Surge as BlackRock’s ETHA Draws in Record $300M in a Day","Ethereum's ether (ETH), the second largest crypto asset, is seeing renewed investor interest, with spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. recording one of their strongest streak of momentum of their one-year history. On Thursday, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) booked its largest daily inflow to date, with over $300 million, pushing its total assets under management to $5.6 billion, data compiled by Farside Investors show. That’s part of a broader resurgence in ether-backed investment products. The nine U.S.-listed ETH ETFs attracted a combined $703 million in net inflows this week, according to crypto data provider SoSoValue . Although Friday’s data is still pending, it has already marked the third-strongest weekly haul since the products launched last July. Investor demand has picked up lately even as ether’s price has lagged behind bitcoin this year, a new report from asset manager Fineqia noted. The AUM of ETH-backed exchange-traded products (ETPs) grew 61% faster in the first half of 2025 than the market capitalization of the underlying asset, a sign of steady inflows into the products, the report said. The report notes that ETP demand began to rebound by late April and continued into June, outpacing ETH's price gain. The capital flood helped fuel ETH's rebound to $3,000, its highest price in more than four months.

2025-07-11T20:20:34,"IBIT Bitcoin ETF Unleashes Unprecedented Growth, Dominating the Investment Landscape","In a stunning display of market demand and institutional confidence, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, has not just entered the investment arena; it has emphatically conquered it. Surpassing an astounding $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) in a mere 374 days, the IBIT Bitcoin ETF has set an unprecedented benchmark, becoming the fastest ETF in history to reach this colossal milestone. This isn’t just a win for BlackRock; it’s a monumental moment for the entire world of cryptocurrency investment , signaling a profound shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. The Phenomenal Rise of the IBIT Bitcoin ETF: A New Benchmark? The numbers speak for themselves, painting a vivid picture of IBIT’s meteoric ascent. As reported by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the IBIT Bitcoin ETF hit the $80 billion mark in just over a year. To put this into perspective, the previous record holder, Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), took a staggering 1,814 days—nearly five times longer—to achieve the same feat. IBIT’s current AUM stands at an impressive $83 billion, solidifying its position as the 21st largest ETF globally, a truly remarkable achievement for a product that was only launched recently. This rapid accumulation of capital underscores a significant shift in investor appetite and a growing comfort with Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. The sheer velocity of this ETF AUM growth is not merely a statistical anomaly; it reflects a powerful underlying current of institutional and retail interest converging on a regulated, accessible pathway to Bitcoin exposure. Understanding the Power of a Bitcoin Spot ETF: What Makes IBIT Different? For years, the crypto community and traditional finance alike awaited the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF in the United States. Why was this such a big deal? Unlike futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, which track the price of Bitcoin futures contracts, a spot ETF directly holds actual Bitcoin. This direct exposure is crucial for several reasons: Direct Price Correlation: A spot ETF aims to track the price of Bitcoin more closely, reducing the basis risk associated with futures contracts. Simplicity for Investors: It offers a straightforward, regulated, and familiar investment vehicle for traditional investors who might be wary of direct cryptocurrency purchases, managing private keys, or dealing with unregulated exchanges. Institutional Comfort: For large institutions like pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers, investing through an ETF provides the regulatory clarity, liquidity, and oversight they require, making it easier to allocate capital to digital assets within their existing frameworks. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, brought its considerable weight and reputation to the table with IBIT, instilling confidence in a market segment often perceived as volatile and risky. Their robust infrastructure, compliance protocols, and extensive distribution network played a pivotal role in attracting significant capital from a diverse range of investors. Unpacking the Surge in ETF AUM Growth: What’s Driving This Unprecedented Inflow? The incredible ETF AUM growth seen in IBIT is not accidental. Several key factors have converged to create this perfect storm of success: Pent-Up Demand: For years, institutional investors and even many retail investors have sought a regulated, secure, and easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership. The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs finally unlocked this immense pent-up demand. BlackRock’s Brand Power: As a titan in the asset management industry, BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF space lent immediate credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. Their track record and robust compliance frameworks reassured hesitant investors. Market Timing: The launch coincided with a period of renewed bullish sentiment in the crypto market, fueled by Bitcoin’s halving event and growing anticipation of interest rate cuts. This positive macro environment encouraged inflows. Ease of Access: Traditional investment platforms now offer IBIT, allowing investors to buy and sell shares through their existing brokerage accounts, just like any other stock or ETF. This accessibility removes significant barriers to entry for new investors. Competitive Landscape: While IBIT is leading, the presence of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs (like Fidelity’s FBTC, Ark Invest’s ARKB, etc.) has created a healthy competitive environment, driving innovation and investor choice. The Dawn of Unprecedented Institutional Bitcoin Adoption IBIT’s rapid ascent is arguably the clearest signal yet of accelerating institutional Bitcoin adoption . This isn’t just about retail investors dipping their toes; it’s about large financial entities integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios and investment strategies. What does this signify? Validation of Bitcoin: Institutional capital flows validate Bitcoin as a legitimate, investable asset class, moving it further away from its early reputation as a niche or speculative digital curiosity. Diversification for Portfolios: Institutions are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a diversifier, a hedge against inflation, and a high-growth asset in a low-yield environment. Market Maturation: The presence of regulated ETF products contributes to the overall maturation of the cryptocurrency market, bringing more liquidity, stability, and transparency. Broader Acceptance: As more institutions gain exposure, it paves the way for even wider acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial system. We could see more crypto-backed products, derivatives, and services emerge. This trend is not confined to the U.S. alone; global interest in similar regulated products is soaring, with other countries closely watching the success of these U.S.-based spot ETFs. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cryptocurrency Investment? The success of the IBIT Bitcoin ETF has profound implications for the future trajectory of cryptocurrency investment . It suggests a future where digital assets are increasingly interwoven with traditional finance, offering both new opportunities and challenges. Opportunities Ahead: Increased Mainstream Participation: More accessible products will attract a broader base of investors, potentially leading to greater market capitalization and liquidity for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Innovation in Financial Products: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for similar products for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, further broadening the institutional investment landscape. Enhanced Market Stability: As institutional capital tends to be more patient and long-term oriented, increased institutional participation could potentially reduce some of the extreme volatility historically associated with crypto markets. Challenges to Consider: Regulatory Scrutiny: With increased adoption comes greater regulatory attention. Future regulations could impact market dynamics. Market Volatility: While institutional money may bring stability, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Investors in IBIT are still exposed to the inherent price swings of Bitcoin. Competition: The ETF market is highly competitive. While IBIT leads, other funds are vying for market share, which could lead to fee wars and constant innovation. Custody Risks: While ETFs mitigate some risks for individual investors, the underlying assets (Bitcoin) still require secure custody solutions, which come with their own set of challenges. For individual investors, the emergence of products like IBIT offers a convenient avenue for exposure. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in a Bitcoin Spot ETF is still an investment in Bitcoin itself, carrying the associated risks. Diversification, understanding one’s risk tolerance, and conducting thorough due diligence remain paramount. A New Era Dawns for Digital Assets The incredible achievement of the IBIT Bitcoin ETF , reaching $80 billion faster than any other ETF in history, is more than just a financial milestone. It’s a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s maturation and its undeniable integration into the mainstream financial system. This unprecedented ETF AUM growth signals a new chapter for institutional Bitcoin adoption , opening doors for broader cryptocurrency investment and reshaping the future of global finance. As IBIT continues its remarkable trajectory, it serves as a beacon, highlighting the immense potential and growing acceptance of digital assets in the portfolios of both traditional and modern investors.

2025-07-11T20:15:28,"OCC’s New Chief Could Redefine Crypto-Banking Relations in the U.S.","Jonathan Gould’s appointment as Comptroller of the Currency is expected to shift the regulatory landscape for crypto in U.S. banking, raising both industry hopes and concerns over centralizing federal oversight. Jonathan Gould Confirmed as New OCC Head The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jonathan Gould as the new Comptroller of the Currency, a pivotal role in the country’s financial regulatory framework. Gould, a former senior executive at blockchain infrastructure firm Bitfury , secured the position following a narrow 50-45 Senate vote, marking another key appointment under President Donald Trump’s administration aimed at reshaping crypto regulation in the United States. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau within the U.S. Treasury, plays a vital yet often understated role in overseeing national banks and shaping federal policy on financial innovation, including digital assets. Gould’s confirmation is expected to influence how traditional banking institutions interact with cryptocurrencies over the next five years. Crypto-Friendly Track Record Jonathan Gould brings a history of crypto advocacy to the OCC. During his previous tenure at the agency, Gould served as senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel, working under Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks. Brooks, known for his pro-crypto stance, championed regulatory frameworks that opened doors for digital asset firms, including granting Anchorage Digital the first federal crypto bank charter. After Brooks left to head Bitfury, Gould followed, serving as the company’s chief legal officer. At the OCC, Gould had previously supported policies enabling U.S. banks to offer crypto custody services and backed early moves towards integrating digital assets into regulated financial infrastructure. His return could set the stage for further initiatives aimed at expanding banks’ roles in the crypto economy, particularly in areas like stablecoin management and Bitcoin ETF options trading. Regulatory Balance and Centralization Concerns While Gould’s appointment has been welcomed by parts of the crypto industry, it raises concerns about the centralization of authority over digital asset oversight. Critics argue that consolidating power within a single federal agency might sideline state-level initiatives and, depending on political shifts, expose the sector to abrupt regulatory reversals. The previous administration under President Joe Biden took a markedly cautious approach to crypto, with federal regulators including the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issuing stringent guidelines for banks engaging with digital assets. These measures, seen by industry players as restrictive, included accusations of cutting off crypto firms from essential banking services. Gould’s confirmation could mark a reversal of that strategy, potentially positioning the OCC as a more crypto-friendly agency. However, the risk remains that if political tides turn against digital assets, the same centralized control could make it harder for crypto-friendly states and local regulators to maintain supportive environments.

2025-07-11T20:14:16,"U.S. stocks end the week slightly lower as traders parse Trump's tariff moves","Wall Street's major averages were beat up on Friday, ending in the red, as President Donald Trump slapped a 35% tariff on Canada and threatened to impose more tariffs across the board. For the week, markets ended slightly lower after posting back-to-back record closes as market participants juggled Trump's tariff announcements against a healthy appetite for technology and growth stocks. The S&P ( SP500 ) on Friday closed -0.3% at 6,259.75 points, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) seesawed but ended -0.2% at 20,585.53 points, and the blue-chip Dow Jones ( DJI ) finished -0.6% at 44,371.51 points. Week-to-date, the indices were -0.3% , -0.1% , and -1% , respectively. Trump announced on Thursday a 35% tariff on Canada and warned about further hikes if Ottawa decided to respond. These levies are expected to take effect Aug. 1, according to a letter posted on his Truth Social account. In addition, Trump said he would impose blanket tariffs of 15-20% on other remaining countries. “Equity markets were a nothingburger all week at index level. All manner of analysis suggests that equities ‘should’ put in a short-term correction around now. Price does not, thus far, agree, with the ascent from the April lows continuing to confound fundamentalists everywhere,” Alex King, investing group leader of Cestrian Capital Research , told Seeking Alpha. Over in the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) rose 7 basis points to 4.42%, while the 2-year yield ( US2Y ) rose 1 basis point to 3.90%. On Friday's economic calendar, the monthly Treasury Statement budget showed an unexpected surplus of $27B in June, when it was expected to be in deficit by $41.5B. Meanwhile, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a new all-time high on Friday, fueled by growing institutional interest and supportive signals from the Trump administration. “The big winners this week have been Bitcoin and Ether, the latter of which is quietly going mainstream under the guise of Everything Is Token. We believe both will trend higher even if equities do, one day, take a breather,” King said.

2025-07-11T20:11:20,"Bhutan Capitalizes on Bitcoin Rally With $23.7M Sale, Outpaces German Strategy","As Bitcoin surges past $112,000, Bhutan strategically liquidates a portion of its holdings at peak market levels, securing significant gains while other governments, notably Germany, face scrutiny for poorly timed sales. Bhutan Executes Timely Bitcoin Sale Bhutan’s sovereign investment fund, Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), made headlines on Wednesday by transferring 213.5 BTC, valued at $23.73 million, to a Binance deposit address. This marked the second consecutive week of sizeable transfers from the Himalayan kingdom, signaling an effort to capitalize on current market strength. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed the transaction, which strategically occurred just hours before Bitcoin reached its highest price level in months. The move is part of Bhutan’s broader treasury strategy, which has increasingly leaned on digital assets as a sovereign wealth tool. Despite recent sales, Bhutan maintains a substantial Bitcoin reserve of 11,711 BTC, estimated at $1.3 billion at current valuations, positioning it as one of the most crypto-forward governments globally. Bitcoin Climbs After Weeks of Consolidation The sale comes as Bitcoin broke past the $112,000 mark this week after spending nearly two months fluctuating between $105,000 and $111,000. Data from Coingecko recorded over $60 billion in global trading volume within a 24-hour window as the world’s largest cryptocurrency surged amid growing market optimism and institutional interest. This bullish momentum, largely fueled by persistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and sustained support from institutional investors, has created sharp contrasts in the approaches of government-backed crypto holders. Germany’s Mistimed Sell-Off Highlights Bhutan’s Prudence In stark contrast, the German government offloaded 49,858 BTC between June 19 and July 12, 2024, at an average price of $57,600 per coin. The total liquidation netted $2.87 billion, but the decision proved costly as Bitcoin’s value more than doubled shortly after the sell-off. At current market rates, the same Bitcoin stockpile would be worth approximately $5.54 billion, representing $2.67 billion in missed unrealized gains. Germany’s poorly timed exit, executed just before the market’s significant rally, has sparked criticism over its asset management strategy. Growing Portfolio and Modest Altcoin Gains Arkham’s data revealed that Bhutan’s overall crypto holdings increased to $1.304 billion as of July 10, a notable rise from $1.26 billion the previous week. The bulk of this $38.4 million gain stemmed from Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, though smaller assets within the government’s wallet also posted modest gains. Tokens such as AIKEK and KIBSHI appreciated by approximately 17% and 42%, respectively, while BOBO, a memecoin holding of 69 million units, added a marginal $3.60 in value. These incremental increases, though minor compared to Bitcoin’s performance, reflect Bhutan’s diversified digital asset portfolio strategy, extending beyond just mining and Bitcoin accumulation.

2025-07-11T20:10:37,"US Stock Market Opening: Why the Decline is Sending Ripples Through Crypto","The financial world often operates like a complex, interconnected web. When one major segment experiences turbulence, it’s natural for ripples to spread, affecting other markets. Today, the news from the US stock market opening lower has certainly caught the attention of investors worldwide, and especially those deeply invested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. While crypto markets often march to their own beat, they are not entirely immune to the broader economic winds blowing through traditional finance. Understanding these connections is crucial for navigating today’s volatile landscape. Understanding the Latest US Stock Market Opening The start of trading today saw a noticeable downturn across all three major U.S. stock indices. This immediate dip often reflects prevailing investor sentiment and macroeconomic concerns that are shaping decisions across various asset classes. For many, the traditional stock market acts as a barometer for the overall economic health, and its movements can provide insights into the appetite for risk among global investors. Here’s a quick snapshot of how the indices opened: S&P 500: -0.39% Nasdaq: -0.31% Dow: -0.60% These figures, while seemingly small percentages, represent billions of dollars in market capitalization and reflect a cautious, if not bearish, sentiment right from the opening bell. Decoding the Recent Stock Market Decline : What the Numbers Say A stock market decline , even a modest one at the open, can be triggered by a confluence of factors. These often include: Inflation Concerns: Persistent inflation can erode purchasing power and corporate profits, leading investors to pull back. Interest Rate Hikes: Central banks raising interest rates to combat inflation can make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, slowing economic growth. Economic Data: Weaker-than-expected jobs reports, manufacturing data, or consumer confidence surveys can signal an impending economic slowdown. Geopolitical Tensions: Global events and political instability can introduce uncertainty, causing investors to seek safer assets. Corporate Earnings: Disappointing earnings reports from major companies can drag down sector-specific or broader market performance. While the exact catalysts for today’s specific opening dip would require deeper analysis of concurrent news, these are the general forces that often contribute to such movements. Investors are constantly weighing these factors, and their collective decisions shape the market’s trajectory. How Nasdaq Performance Reflects Tech Sector Jitters The Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, often acts as a bellwether for investor appetite for higher-risk, higher-reward assets. The observed -0.31% dip in Nasdaq performance at the open suggests that the tech sector, which has often led market rallies in recent years, is currently facing headwinds. This could be due to concerns over rising interest rates, which disproportionately impact growth stocks by making future earnings less valuable, or perhaps specific company news within the tech space. When the tech giants on the Nasdaq experience pressure, it can send a signal across the broader market. Many crypto projects, particularly those focused on Web3, DeFi, and NFTs, are often seen through a similar lens as tech startups – high growth potential, but also higher risk. Therefore, a struggling Nasdaq can sometimes foreshadow or coincide with similar sentiment in the digital asset space. The S&P 500 Dip : A Broader Economic Bellwether? The S&P 500, representing the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies, is widely considered the best gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Its -0.39% S&P 500 dip at the open indicates a broader market apprehension that extends beyond just the tech sector. This index includes a diverse range of industries, from finance and healthcare to consumer staples and industrials. A decline here suggests that concerns are not isolated but are affecting a wide swath of the U.S. economy. For crypto investors, observing the S&P 500 is crucial because it often reflects the general ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’ sentiment. When the S&P 500 shows weakness, it often means investors are pulling back from riskier assets across the board, which can include cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Crypto Market Reaction to Traditional Finance Volatility The big question for our readers is: what does this crypto market reaction look like? Historically, there have been periods where cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, have shown a correlation with traditional stock markets, particularly the Nasdaq. When the stock market dips, Bitcoin and other digital assets can sometimes follow suit, especially during times of macroeconomic uncertainty. This is often attributed to: Liquidity Crunch: In times of panic, investors might sell off crypto to cover losses in traditional markets or to increase their cash reserves. Risk-Off Sentiment: Both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are often considered ‘risk-on’ assets. When investors become risk-averse, they tend to divest from these assets first. Institutional Adoption: As more institutional money enters the crypto space, the correlation with traditional finance might strengthen, as these institutions manage diversified portfolios. However, it’s also important to remember that the crypto market has its own unique drivers, including technological advancements, regulatory news, network upgrades, and community sentiment. While today’s stock market opening might send initial ripples , the long-term trajectory of digital assets will depend on a broader set of factors. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the current market dynamics, what can crypto investors do? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on both traditional financial news and crypto-specific developments. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand that volatility is inherent in both markets. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level. Diversify (Wisely): While diversification within crypto is important, consider how your overall investment portfolio balances traditional and digital assets. Long-Term Perspective: For many, cryptocurrencies are a long-term investment. Short-term market fluctuations, while impactful, may not dictate the ultimate success of your strategy. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Consider a strategy of regular, smaller investments rather than trying to time the market. This can help mitigate the impact of volatility. Conclusion: The Interconnected Financial Landscape The lower opening of the major U.S. stock markets today serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of global finance. While cryptocurrencies strive for decentralization and independence, they are not entirely decoupled from the macroeconomic forces that influence traditional assets. The stock market decline , reflected in the Nasdaq performance and S&P 500 dip , inevitably sends ripples through the entire investment ecosystem, prompting a cautious crypto market reaction . For crypto enthusiasts, this highlights the importance of not just understanding the blockchain and tokenomics, but also keeping a pulse on broader economic indicators. By doing so, investors can better anticipate potential shifts and make more informed decisions in their journey through the exciting, yet sometimes unpredictable, world of digital assets.

2025-07-11T20:04:55,"On-chain Metrics Indicate Potential for Further Bitcoin Rally","On July 11, Bitcoin breached the $118,000 mark. This growth occurred amid active buying by long-term investors. According to CryptoQuant, the balance of ”accumulators” reached an annual maximum of 248,000 BTC. The figure has increased by 71% since June 22. Such strong demand was last seen on December 20, 2025. At that time, Bitcoin traded at $97,000, and the number of coins held at holders' addresses reached a record 278,000 BTC. A Signal for Growth Demand is recovering from a dip in the fourth quarter of 2024. Although net interest remains negative, it is growing rapidly, indicating that buyers are strengthening their positions. Analyst Axel Adler Jr. believes that the first point for profit-taking will come at a price of $130,900. The MVRV ratio must reach 2.75 to begin distribution. The expert compared the market capitalization to the realized capitalization. Glassnode noted a $4.4 billion increase in realized capitalization while crossing $113,000. This shows active investor trades rather than speculative growth, analysts said. $150,000 Target Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead has set a $150,000 target for Bitcoin. The expert sees a bullish cup-and-handle formation that formed in June. Reidhead is confident of further gains for the asset after it returns to $112,000. Kyle Reidhead wrote, ”See you at $150,000.” The chief analyst of Bitget Research, Ryan Lee, shares the same forecast, provided that the current trend and inflows of institutional capital are maintained. In a commentary to ForkLog, the expert said that several factors are influencing the strengthening of Bitcoin: Pro-cryptocurrency rhetoric from the administration of US President Donald Trump Steady inflows of funds into ETFs Increased interest from corporate treasuries All this creates conditions for a continuation of the bullish trend as early as the start of the third quarter. As Lee noted, growth above $117,000 is an important signal for the market and can only be an intermediate stop before a new spurt. The average projected price of Bitcoin in the coming months is $125,000, with an expected trading range of $105,000 to $150,000. The $108,500 (support) and $130,000 (resistance) levels remain important technical benchmarks. According to Lee, consolidation above $130,000 will open the way to a new phase of growth. At the same time, the expert recalled a characteristic feature of the crypto market—high volatility: ”Sharp growth can be accompanied by a rapid correction—down to $110,000, or even into the $100,000–$105,000 range, where the key support zone is located. However, the fundamental trend remains positive.”",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9910/on-chain-metrics-indicate-potential-for-further-bitcoin-rally,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

BTC soared to a new all-time high, just days after crossing $112,000, as it raced to $118,403 before registering a marginal decline and moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 5% in the past 24 hours, trading around $116,617. Meanwhile, ETH rallied over 7%, reaching an intraday high of $2,972 before moving to its current level of $2,963. Ripple (XRP) also traded in positive territory, with the price up over 6%, trading around $2.56. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) crossed the crucial $160 mark thanks to the market rally. The altcoin is up almost 5%, trading around $164. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 10%, trading around $0.198, while Cardano (ADA) is up almost 11%, trading around $0.685. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable gains. Remixpoint Raises $215 Million To Expand Bitcoin Holdings Energy company Remixpoint has raised 31.5 billion yen ($215 million) to expand its Bitcoin treasury. The firm will allocate all the raised funds to purchase BTC. Remixpoint raised the funds through its 25th series of stock acquisition rights and a fourth series of unsecured bonds. The series of stock acquisition rights will create over 55 million new shares, and represents a 39.5% share dilution. Remixpoint is currently the 30th largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, holding 1,051 BTC. The firm plans to increase its holdings to 3,000 BTC in the near term. The news comes after Remixpoint announced that CEO Takashi Tashiro will be paid in Bitcoin as part of the company’s efforts to be “in the same boat” as its shareholders. Remixpoint’s board has unanimously approved its Bitcoin investment strategy, highlighting the potential to enhance corporate value from a risk-return perspective while preserving flexibility. “We have become even more convinced of Bitcoin’s future, and this decision is the result of extensive discussions. We understand the difference between seizing opportunities and playing it safe, as well as the distinction between a challenge and recklessness.” US Treasury Officially Removes Controversial Biden-era Reporting Rule In a big win for DeFi platform compliance with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the US Treasury Department officially removed the controversial DeFi broker reporting rules. The Biden-era rule required DeFi platforms to issue IRS 1099-DA forms for all user transactions. The repeal was part of an earlier act in which the US Congress repealed the rule. President Donald Trump signed the bill in April. Several DeFi-friendly congressmen viewed the rule as a burden on DeFi platforms. They also believed it went against the principles of decentralization. Under the new reporting rules, DeFi platforms will be exempt from several compliance requirements. These include know your customer (KYC) rules and transaction reporting. Additionally, the Congressional Review Act mechanism also ensures the IRS cannot issue a substantially similar rule in the future unless authorized by Congress. However, the repeal is applicable only to non-custodial DeFi applications, with centralized exchanges still subject to 1099-DA forms. Bitcoin (BTC) Could Move To $120,000 Predictions that Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest rally could soar past $120,000 during its latest bull run are on track, with the flagship cryptocurrency crossing $118,000 during the ongoing session and showing no signs of slowing down. While BTC is soaring to record levels, altcoins are emerging as bigger winners, with Ethereum (ETH) crossing the crucial $3,000 mark, and Ripple (XRP) surging past $2.50. ETH is up over 8%, while XRP is up 7%, with buyers firmly in control. BTC broke past $112,000 on Thursday after weeks of trading in range, and continued its uptrend on Friday. Analysts have stated that there is clear evidence of renewed spot demand and conviction buying. “Bitcoin’s latest breakout above $112,000 confirms the market has broken out of its ‘indecisive’ phase. There's clear evidence of renewed spot demand and conviction buying.” The flagship cryptocurrency’s market dominance has also reached multi-year highs. Strong ETF demand, exchange outflows, and corporate treasuries are giving significant bullish signals for the Bitcoin market. Altcoins Surge Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance jumping to multi-year highs has raised questions about altcoins. While BTC is cornering significant capital, altcoins have significant potential for a rally. According to analysts, an altcoin rally could likely come down to macroeconomic factors. “Right now, the trend favors Bitcoin. But just beneath it, altcoins are quietly positioning for a late-summer rotation. But if macro shocks hit (a hawkish Fed pivot or geopolitical escalation), Bitcoin could spike in dominance as risk appetite vanishes.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has soared to a new all-time high just hours after crossing $112,000 on Thursday. The flagship cryptocurrency’s latest push was powered by strong demand from retail and institutional investors, and the crypto-friendly policies of the Trump administration. According to analysts from Sygnum Bank, BTC’s latest rally is being driven by its growing recognition as a safe-haven asset. Katalin Tischhauser, the head of research at Sygnum Bank, stated that BTC has outperformed and has been decoupling on days when the S&P 500 and broader markets corrected. “This has been supported by Bitcoin’s increasing status as a safe haven asset in the face of fiat debasement, also confirmed by the first US state signing a Bitcoin reserve bill into law, following the federal Bitcoin reserve established by Executive Order.” Bitcoin reserves across centralized exchanges have also been declining since April, a sign of long-term confidence in the asset. Declining reserves could lead to a supply shock-driven rally. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to a new all-time high of $118,403, barely 24 hours after it crossed $112,000. BTC’s jump past $118,000 triggered a wave of liquidations, wiping out over $1 billion in short contracts in 24 hours. According to data from Coinglass, the value of shorts liquidated on July 10 is the single-largest liquidation event this year. Long contracts worth $120 million were also liquidated in the same timeframe, highlighting the market’s renewed bullish momentum. Derivatives exchange Bybit accounted for most of the liquidations, with $291 million in contracts liquidated, 98% of which were shorts. HTX saw $138 million in liquidations while Gate ($71.8 million), OKX ($54.62 million), and Binance ($54.56 million) completed the top 5. Analysts pointed out that the current breakout is far calmer and structurally sound, and highlighted that despite the surge, important indicators suggest the market is not overheated. BTC’s MVRV ratio stands at 2.2, significantly lower than the overheated levels seen during rallies in March and December 2024. There has also been a shift in investor behavior. Analysts noted that during previous bull markets, short-term holders made up around 30% of the market. However, the current rally has seen that number drop to 15%, meaning less volatility and a lower risk of sudden selloffs. Miners have also remained relatively quiet, while retail investors are largely missing. BTC has mostly traded positively since last Tuesday’s low of $105,328. The flagship cryptocurrency recovered from this level, rising nearly 3% and settling at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC crossed $110,000 for the first time since May, reaching an intraday high of $110,583. The price registered a marginal decline from this level and settled at $109,637. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC was back in the red on Friday, dropping 1.41% to $108,097. Price action returned to positive over the weekend as BTC rose 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,231. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in the red, dropping almost 1% to $108,273. However, market sentiment began picking up, with the price rising 0.62% on Tuesday and settling at $108,942. Buyers retained control as BTC rose over 2%, briefly crossing $112,000 for the first time before settling at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC raced to an intraday high of $116,401 before settling at $115,159. The flagship cryptocurrency soared past $118,000 during the ongoing session, reaching an intraday high of $118,403 before moving to its current level of $117,255, up almost 2%. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is on the verge of reclaiming $3,000, a level the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has not seen since February 2025. ETH is up nearly 7% in the past 24 hours, as the crypto market soars to new highs. The price had lagged behind BTC this cycle, but the narrative has finally turned bullish thanks to growing ETF inflows and tokenization narratives fueling investor confidence. If ETH closes above $3,000, it could trigger another rally, taking it past the $3,500 mark. Data analytics platform Swissblocks highlighted that the current scenario for ETH is more bullish than Q2, potentially marking the beginning of alt season. ETH inflows have gained momentum, with institutional demand also rising. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures open interest jumped to $3.27 billion, the highest since February 2. The jump suggests increased institutional positioning, indicating a growing appetite among investors to gain exposure to ETH. ETH registered a sharp drop on Tuesday (July 1), dropping over 3% to $2,407. Despite the bearish sentiment, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 7% to cross the moving averages and settle at $2,572. Buyers retained control on Thursday as ETH rose 0.79%, reaching an intraday high of $2,636 before settling at $2,592. However, it lost momentum on Friday, dropping over 3% and settling at $2,509. ETH recovered over the weekend, rising 0.35% on Saturday and over 2% on Sunday to settle at $2,572. Source: TradingView Despite the positive weekend, ETH was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.12% to $2,543. The price rebounded on Tuesday, rising nearly 3% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,616. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH rose almost 6% to cross $2,700 and settle at $2,770. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price reached an intraday high of $3,001 before settling at $2,950. The current session sees ETH up over 1%, trading around $2,981. If ETH closes above $3,000, it could extend its rally beyond $3,500. The MACD and RSI show strong bullish sentiment, but ETH could see a small correction before resuming its rally. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) lost momentum during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down after reaching an intraday high of $166. SOL crossed the crucial $160 mark on Thursday when it raced to $165 before closing at $164. The altcoin’s uptick came amid a jump in market activity as 23-hour trading volumes rose 19% to $4.9 billion, indicating that traders could be readying for a potential breakout. Institutional interest in SOL is also picking up, adding weight to an already-bullish scenario as altcoins get dragged higher by BTC’s jump to a new all-time high. Despite SOL’s impressive performance, it remains substantially lower than its January peak of $294. Analysts, including James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, predict that a Solana ETF could be approved by October. SOL registered a substantial drop last Tuesday, falling over 5% to $147. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 4% to reclaim $150 and settle at $152. SOL reached an intraday high of $156 on Thursday but lost momentum after reaching this level and fell back to $152. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as the price dropped over 3%, slipping below $150 and settling at $147. Sellers retained control on Saturday as SOL registered a marginal decline. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising almost 3% to reclaim $150 and settle at $151. Source: TradingView SOL was back in the red on Monday, dropping almost 2% and settling at $148. Despite the bearish start to the week, the price recovered on Tuesday, rising nearly 2% to reclaim $150 and settle at $151. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as SOL rose 3.54%, crossing the 50-day SMA and settling at $157. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price soared past $160, reaching an intraday high of $165 before settling at $164. The current session sees SOL marginally down as it runs into resistance around the 200-day SMA. A break above this level could see the price reach $200. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) finally broke above the 200-day SMA and the resistance around $2.20, with bulls controlling the momentum.

2025-07-11T20:04:31,"US National Debt Surges $384,700,000,000 in One Week As Massive Pile of Debt Shatters New All-Time High","The US national debt has reached a new record high just one week after a massive spending bill cleared Congress. The Treasury’s Debt to the Penny database shows the government’s mountain of debt surged $384.7 billion from July 3rd to the 9th. That brings the total outstanding debt to an all-time high of $36.6 trillion. This rapid rise is largely driven by the refilling of the Treasury General Account (TGA), as the government resumes borrowing to cover delayed payments and restore cash reserves. The spending bill, signed by President Trump, raised the debt ceiling by a whopping $5 trillion – the largest increase in US history. The debt ceiling now stands at $41.1 trillion, averting default until 2027. The wide-ranging legislation permanently extends the 2017 tax cuts, reducing federal revenue by trillions over the next decade. After accounting for offsets, the CBO forecasts the bill will add around $2.8 trillion to the deficit in 10 years. The Trump administration disputes the estimate, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he believes the bill’s tax cuts and deregulation will spur economic growth that outpaces deficit concerns.

2025-07-11T20:02:01,"Is the BTC Rally Driven by Spot or Leveraged Demand? Glassnode Weighs In","The past 24 hours have witnessed bitcoin (BTC) record all-time highs (ATHs) again and again, with the latest being at almost $119,000. While it is evident that institutional demand and whale movements are driving this rally, analysts have identified another cohort of investors who have contributed to the surge. According to a tweet by the market insights firm, Glassnode, demand from leveraged traders is playing a bigger role in this rally than spot investors. Leveraged Demand Drives BTC Rally Glassnode revealed that Bitcoin’s spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has been on a decline for weeks. CVD analyzes investor sentiment by telling whether aggressive buyers or sellers are dominating the market. The metric measures trading activity by comparing buying and selling volume over a period. Over the past weeks, bitcoin’s spot CVD has recorded rare buy-side spikes, with the latest being on July 9. Conversely, futures CVD has been more reactive. The futures market has recorded frequent buy-side spikes, indicating that traders have been buying BTC aggressively. Since BTC touched $112,000, spot traders have been selling, while futures investors have been buying. Funding for the spot market has remained low and even became negative at some point. As a result, this bitcoin rally has been fueled more by leverage than spot demand. Futures traders have been buying more; however, the market has witnessed little confirmation from spot investors. Notably, Glassnode said low funding is a sign that positioning is not yet crowded. Unfortunately, this shows a structurally fragile setup, which can only get better if spot interest returns. No Signs of Overheating Yet Glassnode’s analysis suggests there is no strong structural backing to support this rally. However, the Bitcoin market is yet to see any signs of overheating, meaning that there is still room for additional growth. The market appears steady, alongside metrics like the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) and Short-term holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). Others, like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) and Miner Position Index (MPI), also signal that sell-side activity is muted. These indicators suggest that investors are cautiously optimistic and not eager to offload their assets. While the market awaits bitcoin’s next move, there is a surge in open interest, with long positions dominating. This comes after shorts have been wiped out , with liquidations running close to $1 billion. The post Is the BTC Rally Driven by Spot or Leveraged Demand?

2025-07-11T20:00:23,"US Dollar Decline Triggered by Loss of Confidence in US Trade and Fiscal Policies, Says Private Banking Giant","The vice president of the private investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman says that America’s trade policies are weakening the US dollar. In a new interview on CNBC, Elias Haddad explains why the greenback is falling by record levels this year. “Clearly the decline in the dollar here reflects the loss of confidence in the US trade, security and perhaps even fiscal policy because you also see a bit of a divergence between the dollar index and the rate differential. I think that reflects this policy uncertainty.” He says the protectionist trade policies under the Trump administration are primarily behind the ongoing drag on the US currency. “First of all, higher tariffs. The average effective tariff rate in the US went from 2% early this year to about 18% right now. That’s a downside risk to growth, upside risk to inflation. That’s bearish for the US dollar. “ Haddad says the ongoing trade war threatens to accelerate the declining role of the US dollar as a primary reserve currency. He says the government’s efforts to narrow the trade deficit also appear to be counterproductive. “The policies aimed at narrowing the trade deficit mean you’ve got less US dollar flowing overseas. There will be less dollars flowing back into US securities – so for all these reasons, we remain bearish on the US dollar.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-11T19:55:39,"Crypto Analyst Says Solana Rival on Cusp of Breakout, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin and Ethereum","A widely followed crypto analyst says that one rival of smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ) is on the brink of breaking out while updating his outlook on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 550,900 followers on the social media platform X that layer-1 blockchain SUI Network ( SUI ) is one weekly close away from taking off. “SUI is on the cusp of a breakout from its macro triangle. It is one weekly close above the diagonal resistance away from kickstarting trend continuation to the upside. SUI continues to be a leader in terms of metrics across layer-1s, with its TVL (total value locked) is over $2 billion.” Source: Rekt Capital/X According to the analyst, not only is SUI ready to rally to the upside, but it has also overtaken Solana in terms of overall stablecoin transfers last month. “SUI has been consolidating inside this macro market structure for most of 2025, soon to challenge the top of the pattern for a major breakout attempt. Fundamentally speaking, SUI has overtaken Solana in terms of monthly stablecoin transfers in the last month.” SUI is trading for $3.56 at time of writing, a 10.6% increase on the day. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Rekt Capital says that its latest surge to a new all-time high means that the “storm is here.” “The price of Bitcoin has increased by +$10,000 since. The storm is here.” Source: Rekt Capital/X He also notes that the crypto king has entered its price discovery uptrend phase. BTC is trading for $117,755 at time of writing, a 5.9% increase during the last 24 hours. Concluding his analysis with ETH, Rekt Capital says that the second-largest digital asset by market cap is ready to rally across its entire macro range of between $2,500 and $3,900. “Ethereum is slowly getting ready to rally across its entire $2500-$3900 macro range (black-black). The macro range low of $2500 has been successfully retested as support to kickstart the range-bound move.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Ethereum is trading for $2,980 at time of writing, a 7.5% increase on the day.

2025-07-11T19:54:11,"State of Crypto: Previewing Congress' 'Crypto Week'","U.S. lawmakers may actually get a crypto bill to the president's desk. The House is set to vote on market structure and stablecoin legislation next week, bringing the U.S. a vital step closer to drafting new rules for the industry. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Crypto win The narrative The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on a market structure bill, a stablecoin bill and a bill banning a U.S. central bank digital currency next week. Perhaps it's premature to suggest the industry will notch a major win — but all signs indicate that U.S. President Donald Trump will sign a stablecoin bill into law before the August recess, as his team has sought since February. Why it matters The crypto industry has long sought ""regulatory clarity"" on its own terms — previous rule proposals it disagreed with were fervently opposed and the industry's political action committees poured tens of millions of dollars into the 2024 elections to try and create a Congress that would be friendlier to crypto policies. Next week, those efforts may pay off, as the House of Representatives gets set to vote on a stablecoin bill that may become law within weeks and a market structure bill that could get to the White House before Christmas. Breaking it down The House of Representatives dubbed next week — July 14 to July 18 — ""Crypto Week."" The main event will be the House vote on, and expected passage of, the ""Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025"" (Clarity), the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act and the ""Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025"" (GENIUS). The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet Monday at 4:00 p.m. ET to discuss each of the bills . That means there may be a floor vote, where the entire House votes, by Tuesday. Though there was some discussion of packaging the Clarity and GENIUS Acts into one larger bill, it appears there will instead be separate votes for each of the bills. If the GENIUS Act does receive its own vote, U.S. President Donald Trump may sign it into law as soon as next Friday or the following Monday, I'm told, though at this point none of this is confirmed (and obviously depends on the actual House vote). Notably, the House Financial Services Committee confirmed on Thursday that the House would vote on the GENIUS Bill sent to it by the Senate, and not its own ""Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy"" (STABLE Act), as previously reported by CoinDesk's Jesse Hamilton. It is likely that all three bills will pass, and with bipartisan majorities. To recap: The Clarity Act will create a framework for how different cryptocurrencies are treated by federal regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. There's no Senate counterpart to this bill yet, though the Senate Banking Committee has already held multiple hearings on market structure issues, and the Senate Agriculture Committee has scheduled a hearing for this upcoming Tuesday on the same topic. Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott previously said he expects the Senate to wrap up its work on market structure by Sept. 30. The House's last effort to pass market structure legislation, last year's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, saw massive bipartisan support with 279 lawmakers (208 Republicans and 71 Democrats) voting in favor of the bill. While there is no public whip count yet for this year's version, the Clarity Act passed out of the House Agriculture Committee with massive bipartisan support (47-6) and the House Financial Services Committee with some bipartisan support (32-19). Either number suggests both Democrats and Republicans will vote for the bill on the House floor. The GENIUS Act will set up a framework for overseeing stablecoins. The Senate already passed the GENIUS Act, meaning once the House passes it, it goes to Trump's desk for his signature into law. This could mark the stablecoin bill as the first major crypto-focused bill to become law. The GENIUS Act could then also be one of the few bills that isn't a ""must-pass"" to go through the legislative process, meaning it's not a budget bill and it's not the annual National Defense Authorization Act. While the House is voting on the Senate version and not its own STABLE Act, updated House text in the Clarity Act would add some additional rules around stablecoins. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act would, as the name suggests, ban the U.S. from developing or launching a central bank digital currency. The House passed a version of this bill in 2024 as well. In theory, the passage of these bills is positive for the industry. Though it may take time for regulators to write and implement rules after these bills become law, within the next few years crypto companies will have firm guidelines to operate within. Less clear is what these bills may actually do for usage or adoption. A recent publication by Moody's Ratings suggested that while passage of the GENIUS Act will ""have significant implications for banks"" but that stablecoins writ large ""need to offer a compelling advantage over existing consumer and commercial payment systems"" to become a more broadly accepted transaction tool. ""While there appears to be solid bipartisan political support for U.S. stablecoins, assuming issuers are prohibited from paying any kind of financial incentive, we view the likelihood of a significant shift in domestic payments toward stablecoins as relatively modest,"" the report said. Democrats are raising concern about the potential for these bills' passage to enable or further corruption, with Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters and Rep. Stephen Lynch pointing to Trump's crypto ventures and their potential for enriching the president. ""These bills serve as a brazen stamp of approval for the blatant abuse of power we’re witnessing in real time,"" Waters said in a statement. The House Ways and Means Committee is also holding a hearing on crypto taxation next Wednesday, though it hasn't shared many details yet. To recap the schedule for next week, or if you want to just see it at a glance: Monday, July 14, 4:00 p.m. ET: The House Rules Committee will meet and discuss the Clarity Act, GENIUS Act and Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act. Tuesday, July 15, 3:00 p.m. ET: The Senate Agriculture Committee will hold a hearing on market structure legislation. Tuesday, July 15, time TBA: The House may meet and begin voting on all three bills discussed above. Wednesday, July 16, 9:00 a.m. ET: The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on crypto taxation. Thursday, July 17: Nothing is scheduled (at least right now). Friday, July 18: If the House votes to advance GENIUS on Tuesday, there may be a bill signing.

2025-07-11T19:50:41,"Bitcoin Holders Remain Calm: Glassnode’s Crucial NUPL Insight","The cryptocurrency world is abuzz. Bitcoin (BTC) recently surged past $118,000, marking a new all-time high (ATH) that sent ripples of excitement across the market. Yet, amidst this euphoria, a fascinating insight from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode offers a more nuanced perspective. Their latest report on X reveals that despite the price milestone, the Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric remains conspicuously below the ‘euphoria zone’ at 0.69. What does this surprising data tell us about the current Bitcoin bull run, and why is it so significant? What is NUPL and Why Does it Matter for Bitcoin? Before diving deeper into Glassnode’s findings, let’s clarify what the NUPL metric actually represents. NUPL, or Net Unrealized Profit and Loss, is an on-chain indicator that measures the overall profitability of the Bitcoin market. It calculates the difference between realized cap and market cap, divided by market cap, effectively showing the aggregate profit or loss of all coins in circulation that have not yet been sold. When the NUPL value is high, it indicates that a large portion of the market is in profit, suggesting potential for profit-taking and market tops. Specifically, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) NUPL focuses only on coins held by entities identified as ‘long-term holders’ – typically addresses that have held their Bitcoin for over 155 days. These holders are often considered the ‘smart money’ or ‘strong hands’ in the market, less prone to panic selling and more likely to accumulate during dips. Their collective profit and loss status can provide profound insights into the market’s psychological state and potential turning points. A high LTH NUPL typically signals that these experienced holders are sitting on significant profits, often preceding major corrections as they begin to distribute their holdings. Glassnode’s Revelation: Is This Bitcoin Cycle Truly Different? The core of Glassnode’s recent report lies in a striking comparison: while Bitcoin has reached unprecedented price levels, the LTH NUPL has only spent approximately 30 days above the 0.75 threshold – a zone historically associated with peak market euphoria and distribution by long-term holders. Contrast this with the previous bull cycle, which saw a staggering 228 days above this very threshold. This stark difference, as highlighted by Glassnode , suggests a potentially unique characteristic of the current market phase. What could explain this divergence? Is it a sign of a more mature market, where institutional adoption and broader understanding lead to less speculative frenzy? Or does it indicate that long-term holders, perhaps scarred by previous bear markets, are simply holding out for even higher prices, anticipating a longer, more sustained bull run? The fact that the LTH NUPL remains at 0.69, below the typical ‘euphoria’ point, implies that a significant portion of these steadfast holders are still accumulating or holding, rather than engaging in widespread profit-taking. This behavior could be a strong bullish signal, suggesting that the market has not yet reached its peak of irrational exuberance. The Unwavering Conviction of Long-Term Holders The role of Long-Term Holders in the Bitcoin ecosystem cannot be overstated. These are the individuals and entities who have weathered multiple market cycles, enduring significant volatility and drawdowns. Their conviction is a cornerstone of Bitcoin’s price stability and long-term growth. When LTHs begin to sell en masse, it often signals a market top. Conversely, when they continue to accumulate or hold through price rallies, it suggests underlying strength and confidence in future appreciation. The current data from Glassnode suggests that these seasoned investors are not yet showing signs of widespread distribution. Their collective unrealized profits, while substantial, are not at levels that historically trigger a mass exodus. This could mean several things: Increased Market Maturity: Long-term holders might be more sophisticated, understanding that Bitcoin’s long-term potential far exceeds previous cycles’ peaks. Supply Shock in Progress: If LTHs aren’t selling, it means new demand must be met by other market participants, potentially leading to a supply squeeze. Anticipation of Higher Peaks: They might believe the true ‘euphoria zone’ for this cycle is much higher, given the growing mainstream adoption and macroeconomic factors. Their continued holding pattern acts as a strong support mechanism for the price, indicating that the supply held by the most patient hands remains largely locked up. Decoding the Current Crypto Market Analysis This insight from Glassnode is crucial for any comprehensive Crypto Market Analysis . If long-term holders are not yet in a state of euphoria, it implies that the market might have more room to run before reaching a cyclical top. Unlike previous cycles where retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) often led to rapid price increases followed by sharp corrections driven by LTH distribution, this cycle appears to be unfolding differently. The absence of widespread LTH euphoria could point to: A More Sustainable Rally: A slower, more gradual climb might be healthier, allowing for new capital to enter without immediate heavy selling pressure from long-term holders. Institutional Influence: The growing presence of institutional investors, who typically have longer investment horizons and different profit-taking strategies, might be dampening the traditional retail-driven euphoria peaks. Broader Accumulation: It suggests that accumulation might still be ongoing at various levels, not just by long-term holders, but also by new entrants who are buying into the rally. This unique market dynamic suggests that while Bitcoin has achieved a new ATH, the underlying structure of the market, particularly from the perspective of its most seasoned participants, indicates a phase of continued strength rather than imminent exhaustion. Actionable Insights: Navigating Bitcoin’s Current Phase So, what does this mean for you, the investor, navigating Bitcoin ‘s current price action? The Glassnode data offers several key actionable insights: Patience is Key: The fact that long-term holders are not yet in a full euphoria state suggests that there might be more upside potential before a significant market top. Avoid premature profit-taking if your investment horizon is long-term. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Continue to pay close attention to on-chain indicators like NUPL, Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), and accumulation trends. These metrics provide a deeper understanding of market participant behavior beyond just price. Beware of Euphoria Creep: While LTHs aren’t euphoric yet, retail sentiment can shift quickly. Be prepared for increased volatility if and when the market does enter the traditional ‘euphoria zone.’ Risk Management: Despite the bullish signals, always practice sound risk management. Market conditions can change rapidly. This cycle’s distinct behavior, as illuminated by Glassnode, offers a valuable lesson: past performance is not always indicative of future results, and on-chain data provides a powerful lens to understand the present. The market is evolving, and the behavior of its most committed participants reflects this maturation. In conclusion, while Bitcoin ‘s new all-time high is undoubtedly exciting, Glassnode ‘s report on the Long-Term Holder NUPL provides a fascinating counter-narrative to the idea of immediate market overheating. The fact that these steadfast holders remain below the ‘euphoria zone’ suggests a more measured, potentially more sustainable, bull run compared to previous cycles. This unique dynamic, revealed through meticulous Crypto Market Analysis , offers a compelling reason for investors to remain observant and strategic, understanding that this cycle might just be unfolding in an unprecedented and intriguing way.

2025-07-11T19:50:21,"K33’s Bold Bitcoin Purchase: Swedish Crypto Broker Boosts Holdings to 85 BTC","In a significant move that underscores growing institutional confidence in the digital asset space, Swedish crypto broker K33 has announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin reserves. This strategic decision to boost its Bitcoin holdings not only strengthens K33’s balance sheet but also sends a clear signal about its long-term conviction in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What does this latest K33 Bitcoin purchase mean for the company and the broader crypto market? What’s Driving K33’s Strategic Bitcoin Purchase? K33, a prominent Swedish crypto broker , recently made waves by announcing on X (formerly Twitter) that it has acquired an additional 50 Bitcoin (BTC). This latest acquisition brings its total Bitcoin reserves to an impressive 85 BTC. The average purchase price for this batch was reported at 1,089,220 SEK, which translates to approximately $114,186. This isn’t K33’s first foray into bolstering its reserves; the company previously completed a direct stock issuance worth $19.2 million specifically to enhance its BTC reserves. This aggressive accumulation strategy by K33 is not merely about holding a digital asset; it’s a calculated business decision. For a crypto broker, holding a significant amount of Bitcoin can serve multiple purposes: Balance Sheet Strength: Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ can act as a robust reserve asset, fortifying the company’s financial position in a volatile market. Client Confidence: Demonstrating conviction in Bitcoin through direct holdings can instill greater trust among clients, signaling that the broker is aligned with the long-term growth of the asset class it facilitates trading in. Future Growth Potential: With Bitcoin’s price movements often tied to supply halving events and increasing mainstream adoption, accumulating BTC at strategic points positions the company for potential future appreciation. The decision to conduct a stock issuance specifically for this purpose highlights a deliberate and well-funded strategy, moving beyond speculative trading to treating Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The Rise of the Swedish Crypto Broker: A Nordic Perspective K33’s actions reflect a broader trend of increased sophistication and confidence within the Nordic crypto landscape. As a leading Swedish crypto broker , K33 is at the forefront of digital asset adoption in a region known for its technological advancement and financial stability. Their proactive approach to increasing Bitcoin holdings sets a precedent for other financial institutions in the area and potentially across Europe. Historically, traditional financial institutions have been cautious about direct exposure to cryptocurrencies. However, companies like K33 are demonstrating that it’s possible to integrate digital assets into a core business model while maintaining regulatory compliance and investor confidence. This shift is crucial for the maturation of the crypto market, bridging the gap between nascent technology and established financial practices. What does this mean for the average investor? It suggests that the market is becoming more robust and reliable, with established entities taking on direct exposure, which could pave the way for more mainstream products and services. Decoding K33’s Bitcoin Holdings: What Does 85 BTC Mean? While 85 BTC might seem like a modest sum compared to the holdings of giants like MicroStrategy, for a regional crypto broker, it represents a significant commitment. At current market prices, 85 BTC is a substantial investment, underscoring K33’s conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This amount places K33 among a growing list of public and private companies that are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The average purchase price of approximately $114,186 per BTC (in SEK equivalent) indicates that K33 is not shying away from current market valuations, suggesting they believe in significant upside potential. This contrasts with companies that might only acquire during deep dips, showcasing K33’s belief in the asset’s sustained growth trajectory, regardless of short-term fluctuations. For investors, this signals that even at elevated price points, institutions see value in accumulating Bitcoin. It reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties, rather than just a speculative asset. Navigating Crypto Market Trends: K33’s Vision K33’s strategic moves are undoubtedly influenced by current crypto market trends . The market has witnessed a resurgence of institutional interest, fueled by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, and a broader recognition of digital assets as a legitimate investment class. These factors collectively contribute to a bullish sentiment, and K33 appears to be positioning itself to capitalize on this momentum. Their decision to increase Bitcoin holdings suggests a proactive stance on anticipating market shifts and adapting their business model accordingly. Instead of merely facilitating trades, K33 is actively participating in the market’s evolution, becoming a holder and believer in the assets they serve. This approach highlights several key insights for navigating the crypto market: Long-Term Vision: Successful players in the crypto space often adopt a long-term perspective, focusing on accumulation rather than short-term trading. Strategic Capital Allocation: Utilizing capital, even through stock issuance, to acquire core assets demonstrates a commitment to future growth. Confidence in Ecosystem: A broker investing in the very asset it trades signals profound confidence in the underlying technology and market infrastructure. These actions by K33 are a testament to the evolving maturity of the crypto market, moving from a niche investment to a recognized asset class within the global financial system. The Wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Continues K33’s latest acquisition is a compelling example of the accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . From public companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla to investment funds and now crypto brokers like K33, an increasing number of corporate entities are integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. This trend is a powerful validator for Bitcoin’s legitimacy and its potential to serve as a global reserve asset. The implications of this widespread adoption are significant: Increased Liquidity: More institutional holders can lead to deeper liquidity pools, making the market more stable and efficient. Reduced Volatility: While Bitcoin remains volatile, increased institutional holding can, over time, contribute to a more stable price floor as large entities tend to be long-term holders. Regulatory Clarity: As more institutions enter the space, there is a growing demand for clearer regulatory frameworks, which can benefit the entire ecosystem. K33’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a piece of a much larger puzzle, illustrating how Bitcoin is steadily cementing its place within the global financial architecture. It signifies a future where digital assets are an undeniable part of corporate and institutional portfolios. A Bold Statement of Conviction K33’s decision to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings to 85 BTC, funded in part by a substantial stock issuance, is a powerful declaration of its confidence in the future of digital assets. As a leading Swedish crypto broker , K33 is not just facilitating trades; it is actively participating in the market’s evolution, showcasing a strategic vision aligned with the long-term growth of Bitcoin. This move highlights a crucial aspect of current crypto market trends : the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption , reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a vital asset in modern portfolios. K33’s bold steps underscore a growing belief among financial entities that Bitcoin is here to stay, offering both strategic value and significant future potential.

2025-07-11T19:45:37,"Russian crypto criminal seeks U.S. President Trump’s pardon","The Russian founder of a cryptocurrency exchange shut down for allegedly processing illicit funds for criminals has turned to Donald Trump with a plea for a pardon. While having already served his sentence in America, the convicted crypto entrepreneur hopes the U.S. President will help him avoid extradition to France, where he is likely to spend more time in prison. Crypto exchange Bitzlato owner seeks clemency from Trump A Russian national who was arrested and sentenced in the United States for his crypto trading business has asked the U.S. head of state for a pardon, his lawyer, Ivan Melnikov, revealed to Russia’s TASS news agency. Melnikov, who serves as vice president of the Russian branch of the International Committee for Human Rights organization, was quoted on Friday as stating: “Anatoly Legkodymov, the Russian engineer and co-founder of the Bitzlato cryptocurrency platform, has officially asked U.S. President Donald Trump for pardon.” The lawyer noted that the move comes amid ongoing attempts by authorities in Paris to secure Legkodymov’s extradition to France, where he may receive another 20 years behind bars, according to the Russian media report. Legkodymov, who was also the majority owner and chief executive of Bitzlato, was arrested in Miami in 2023, with French help, and later charged for operating the peer-to-peer crypto trading platform as an unlicensed money exchange service. After court proceedings that took a year and a half, the Russian was sentenced to 18 months in prison, which he had already served in pre-trial detention. However, following France’s request for his extradition, the U.S. judiciary decided to keep him in custody. Melnikov, who claims that Bitzlato was actually “a noticeboard for transactions,” insisted: “Anatoly is not a criminal. He became a target in a political campaign against the crypto market and talented Russian programmers.” The legal defender added his client’s decision to seek a pardon from Trump was “based on the hope that the U.S. will return to a more balanced and fair approach to digital finance, and that the United States and Russia will gradually build dialogue.” Another Russian crypto boss in trouble with the West However, during his trial in a New York court, Legkodymov did plead guilty to running an unlicensed money-transmitting business in late 2023. He also agreed to forfeit $23 million worth of crypto assets associated with his exchange. According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Hong Kong-registered Bitzlato operated globally, presenting itself as a platform requiring minimal identification from users. Announcing the charges against its Russian founder, the DOJ explained: “As a result of these deficient know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, Bitzlato allegedly became a haven for criminal proceeds and funds intended for use in criminal activity.” The department claimed that Bitzlato’s largest counterparty was Hydra, arguably the largest and longest-running darknet market, which was quite popular in the Russian-speaking corners of the dark web. Hydra users traded an estimated $700 million in coins with the exchange. The case of Bitzlato and its owner is not the first time a Russian crypto trading platform and its management have found themselves in trouble with law enforcement in the West. Last month, TASS reported that Poland agreed to hand over to the United States the former chief executive of Wex, once Russia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Dmitry Vasiliev was arrested in Warsaw in 2024 at a request from the U.S., where he is accused of fraud and money laundering. Wex is the successor of the infamous BTC-e exchange, believed to have laundered $9 billion. Its alleged operator, Russian citizen Alexander Vinnik, was arrested in Greece in 2017 and later extradited to France, where he was sentenced to five years in prison in December 2020. Vinnik was then transferred to the U.S. to face additional charges. He was eventually exchanged for American schoolteacher Marc Fogel in a prisoner swap deal agreed by the Trump administration and President Putin’s Russia. The Bitzlato founder Anatoly Legkodymov’s plea for pardon comes after in January, Trump signed an executive order pardoning Ross Ulbricht, the operator of the Silk Road darknet marketplace, who had served 11 years of his double life sentence without parole.
