2025-07-12T16:57:28,"DWF Ventures Analyzes USDT’s Prospects of Dominating Competitive Stablecoin Market","Dubai, UAE, July 12th, 2025, Chainwire DWF Ventures, the venture arm of web3 investor and market maker DWF Labs, has released a comprehensive report exploring the future of stablecoins, with a spotlight on Tether's USDT and scaling solutions like Plasma and Stable. The analysis delves into the current state of stablecoins and how new purpose-built chains are poised to enhance USDT's global adoption by addressing compliance and scalability issues. In its stablecoin analysis, delivered in the form of an X thread, DWF Ventures examines the evolution of stablecoins, from synthetic dollars to digital payment solutions powering over $27 trillion in transfer volume, surpassing giants like Visa and Mastercard. It highlights how stablecoins now support use cases such as inflation hedging, global payroll, remittances, and consumer fintech. The report assesses the US Treasury Secretary's expectation of a $2 trillion stablecoin market by 2028, alongside recent milestones like Circle's IPO and the GENIUS Act. However, DWF Ventures identifies key inefficiencies in the current stablecoin ecosystem, including liquidity fragmentation across chains, lack of transparency, complex fiat ramps, and vulnerability to regulatory shifts. Issuers and adopters face chain dependency risks, volatile fees, and optimization gaps, particularly as over 80% of transactions occur on Tron and Ethereum. Tether dominates with a 62% market share and commensurate revenue, with USDT and Circle’s USDC accounting for 83% of transactions. This dominance has spurred new projects like Stable and Plasma, both backed by Tether, to optimize USDT for broader use cases such as payments, remittances, and enterprise DeFi. Stable is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 designed exclusively for stablecoins, featuring zero gas fees on USDT transfers and native USDT gas payments, DWF Ventures notes, making it the first standalone L1 to enable this. It unlocks low-cost scalability through features like bridging via LayerZero, native liquidity on Stable L1, built-in institutional compliance tools, off-chain sequencing, and a private mempool for enterprises. Plasma, an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain focused on stablecoins, has already hit a $1 billion deposit cap amid buzz around its upcoming XPL public sale. It emphasizes enabling scalable onchain merchant payments, remittances, commodity trading, and yields on stablecoins and Bitcoin. Key features include gas fees paid in whitelisted tokens with zero fees for USDT transfers, optional privacy via ZK or mixer protocols, and performance of up to 2K TPS with low latency. The report compares these solutions against Tron, highlighting shared traits such as the ability for USDT to serve as a native gas token as well as the availability of protocol-level compliance, but notes distinctions in network types, consensus mechanisms, and privacy features. While Tron excels in cross-chain bridging, high DeFi activity, and community governance, Stable prioritizes enterprise tools, and Plasma offers optional privacy and Bitcoin integration. DWF Ventures warns of ongoing challenges, including regulatory uncertainties and the need for better infrastructure to scale stablecoins into a foundational financial system. Yet it remains bullish, viewing Plasma and Stable not as replacements for USDT but as upgrades for faster and compliant global adoption. The analysis concludes: “Stablecoins as a whole aren’t just growing, they are forming and becoming the foundation for a new financial system.” DWF Ventures anticipates continued stablecoin growth and innovation and invites builders to connect for potential investments.

2025-07-12T16:55:14,"Florida Attorney General Probing Retail Trading Giant Robinhood for Allegedly Claiming To Be the Least Expensive Crypto Platform","Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has launched an investigation into Robinhood over allegations that the retail trading giant falsely promotes its crypto platform as the least expensive way to purchase digital assets. Uthmeier notes that Robinhood earns revenue by routing customers’ trades to third-party market makers in a payment-for-order-flow (PFOF) system. The state attorney general says Robinhood attracts customers by claiming to offer the “lowest cost on average” to trade crypto. Uthmeier argues, however, that Robinhood’s PFOF structure actually makes it more expensive than competing platforms that offer all-in trading costs. “When consumers buy and sell crypto assets, they deserve transparency in their transactions. Robinhood has long claimed to be the best bargain, but we believe those representations were deceptive.” The attorney general says third-party market makers that pay Robinhood for order flow sometimes have to charge worse prices to be profitable. Uthmeier issued a subpoena, asking Robinhood for organizational documents, employee information, advertising history, disclosures made to users related to fees, pricing documents, PFOF information, documents related to the sale of customer data, and information regarding Florida users specifically. Robinhood’s crypto division is required to respond to the subpoena by the end of the month, according to the attorney general.

2025-07-12T16:12:00,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Two Consecutive $1B+ Inflow Days for First Time","US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded over $1 billion in inflows for two straight days, a first since their launch in January 2024. Key Takeaways: US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $1 billion in inflows for two consecutive days for the first time. BlackRock’s IBIT dominated Friday’s inflows with $953 million. Analysts warn that such high inflows may not be sustainable at current Bitcoin price levels. On Friday, 11 spot Bitcoin ETF products reported combined inflows totaling $1.03 billion, following $1.17 billion the previous day, according to Farside data . BlackRock’s IBIT accounted for the lion’s share of the inflows, attracting over $953 million on Friday. Only Seven Days of $1 Billion+ Inflows Recorded Since ETF Launch Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, noted in an X post that since the launch of these ETFs, there have been only seven days with inflows exceeding $1 billion. Notably, two of those occurred in the last two days. The previous high was $1.07 billion on January 17, 2024. The $1.17 billion inflow on Thursday was the second-largest daily figure since inception, surpassed only by the $1.37 billion inflow on November 7, 2024, the day of Donald Trump’s US presidential election victory. Matt Hougan, Bitwise Invest’s chief investment officer, highlighted that while the Bitcoin network produced roughly 450 BTC on Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs bought about 10,000 BTC. Similarly, blockchain analytics firm Jan3 noted that on Wednesday, Bitcoin ETF demand was 22 times greater than the daily mined supply. However, Jan3 CEO Samson Mow cautioned that such demand is unlikely to be sustainable at current price levels. This demand is not sustainable at these price levels. https://t.co/JkzZVPFo08 — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 11, 2025 The strong demand contributed to $2.72 billion in inflows over the past five trading days. Bitcoin’s price surged to new all-time highs, reaching $112,000 on Wednesday and climbing further to $118,780 on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. The price rally helped BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) surpass $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) on Thursday. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called it the “fastest ETF” to reach this milestone, achieving it in just 374 days. Recently, BlackRock reported earning more revenue from IBIT than from its flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. Balchunas added that total assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed $140 billion for the first time, largely driven by the recent price surge. As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. Institutional Bitcoin Demand Shifts From ETFs to Corporate Treasuries Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. Japan’s Metaplanet recently bought $237 million worth of BTC , becoming the fifth-largest corporate holder with a stack exceeding 15,500 BTC. France’s The Blockchain Group and the UK’s Smarter Web Company also made new BTC treasury allocations this week, purchasing $12.5 million and $24.3 million worth of Bitcoin respectively. Remixpoint, a Tokyo-listed firm, raised $215 million to fund a planned accumulation of 3,000 BTC.

2025-07-12T16:02:50,"ETH hitting $3k ignites alt season sentiments","Ethereum treasury company Sharplink Gaming has acquired another 21,487 ETH worth $64.24 million. The company bought the ETH in over-the-counter (OTC) deals within six hours through Galaxy Digital and Coinbase Prime. This follows its recent purchase of 10,000 ETH from the Ethereum Foundation for more $25 million through an OTC deal, continuing the company’s buying spree. According to crypto analyst Ember CN , the firm has 253,000 ETH with an average purchase price of $2,647. Sharplink, a gaming company, before it pivoted to crypto by establishing an Ethereum Treasury in early June, has Consensys Chairman and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin as its chairman. Although the company initially raised around $425 million to buy ETH, it has already spent over $600 million on acquiring Ethereum in less than two months, contributing significantly to buying pressure around the asset. Its decision to adopt the ETH treasury could not have come at a better time, with the asset seeing sizable gains over the past few weeks, enough to make the Sharplink portfolio turn profitable. With ETH gaining 17.75% in the last seven days and briefly crossing $3,000 for the first time since February 2025 before dropping to the $2,900 range, the company is now sitting on unrealized profits. Per Ember_CN, the firm has over $79 million in profits at the current ETH price. Sharplink stock outperforms ETH since the first acquisition Even more interesting is how Sharplink (SBET) has been performing relative to ETH since the company adopted the ETH treasury. According to CryptoQuant , SBET is up 486% since Sharplink first invested in ETH. By comparison, ETH has only been 17% since then. Sharplink stock value has quadrupled since adopting ETH Treasury (Source: CryptoQuant) Interestingly, this is not unique to Sharplink and ETH. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) stock MSTR has performed relatively better than Bitcoin. According to Yahoo Finance data, BTC is up only 24.75% this year while MSTR is up 44.86%. Unsurprisingly, the company stock is trading at a premium to the ETH it holds. With a market cap of $1.55 billion, the value of ETH backing each SBET stock based on its current ETH holdings is only 0.00353 ETH, worth around $10.40 at current prices. This is far below the $21.5 share value. However, the recent gains of Sharplink stock are a welcome development given that the shares are still trading far below their peak. SBET peaked in May at $124 and has fallen significantly since then, with its registration of shares filing a few months ago even part of the factors contributing to that decline. Meanwhile, the company is now the largest holder of ETH after its latest purchase, which took it above the Ethereum Foundation holdings of 242,489 ETH. ETH hitting $3k ignites alt season sentiments The $3,000 mark represents a significant price level for Ethereum, both psychologically and financially. According to Santiment , 124.13 million of the total 155.04 million ETH in existence are at a higher price at this level than when they first originated. This means that 4 out of every 5 ETH tokens are in profit above $3,000. Meanwhile, many believe the altcoin season might be on the way, noting the sustained ETH performance over the past few weeks that has allowed the token to wipe off most of its losses this year. There were further signs of interest with ETH futures flipping that of BTC a few days ago, according to Glassnode data, with a 24-hour volume of $62.1 billion compared to the $61.7 billion. The drop in Bitcoin dominance from 66% to 64.5% has also contributed to this sentiment. ETH exchange-traded funds have also started attracting massive volume, with $1.10 billion in net inflows into the products in July. The month is now on track to become the second-best month for ETH ETFs since its launch in 2024 and is already third, only a few hundred million behind June 2025, which had $1.16 billion, and over a billion behind December 2024 with $2.08 billion.

Here’s What Analysts Say","Cryptocurrency analysis firm Santiment released a compelling analysis of market dynamics in its latest report. Warnings range from Ethereum whales to the memecoin craze, from XRP volatility to signals of altcoin season. According to data from Santiment, large wallets holding more than 10,000 ETH hold 75.74% of the Ethereum supply, the highest level since May 2017. The company considers this increase a long-term bullish signal. While Bitcoin remains in the headlines, Ethereum is quietly gaining attention as it approaches the $3,000 mark. Social media optimism surrounding ETH is high. However, Santiment analyst Brian warns that this overwhelming positive sentiment could be counterproductive in the short term. Related News: Big Crypto Whales Make Big Trades as the Market Rises - Here's What They Trade According to the analytics firm's report, memecoins were the cryptocurrency sector that rose the most last week. Brian highlighted this area, which led the way with an average increase of 17%, arguing that this could be a sign of market saturation and a potential peak approach. According to Santiment, the number of wallets holding one million XRP or more has reached an all-time high of 2,743. At the same time, the total amount of XRP held by these whales is also increasing. This double-edged surge is considered a strong bullish signal for XRP. Santiment's data reveals that many altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. However, the sustainability of this trend depends on Bitcoin's stability above the $110,000 level, which the company stated is a critical threshold for the altcoin market. While the week ended on a strong note, the next few days will be the true test of the market. Analysts predict Monday, in particular, will reveal whether the crypto market can maintain its momentum. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-12T15:26:51,"Binance Crushes Rivals: Grabs 37% of Global BTC Spot Volume in H1 2025","Binance led global BTC spot volume in the first half of 2025. CryptoQuant’s latest analysis revealed that the crypto exchange commanded more than 37% market share, which is equivalent to over $3.44 trillion in traded volume. This significant lead evidenced Binance’s position as the primary hub for Bitcoin liquidity and major flow activity, as volume spikes and large trades often appear there first. Competitors Lag Behind Other prominent platforms such as Bybit, Crypto.com, Coinbase, and OKX collectively accounted for around 29% of total spot volume during the same period. Together, they formed the next tier of liquidity centers despite the wide gap with Binance. Meanwhile, crypto exchanges such as Upbit, Bitget, and HuobiPro each hovered around the 5% mark. While they did maintain relevance in the global market, but had comparatively lower influence, as noted by CryptoQuant. On the other hand, Kraken, KuCoin, and Gate.io, among other long-tail exchanges, each contributed less than 3% of total BTC spot volume and largely served niche or regional markets. “Bottom line: If you’re looking for deep liquidity or want to track major BTC flow activity, Binance is still the primary exchange (by far).” Beyond its spot volume share, Binance also dominates in whale activity. Bitcoin Whales Won’t Leave Binance In fact, CryptoQuant found that Binance has been leading in cumulative whale transaction flows across centralized exchanges. The exchange recorded a whopping 31.36 million BTC in whale inflows and 30.82 million BTC in outflows. This reflected not the total BTC supply but the sheer velocity and frequency of whale-sized movements (≥1000 BTC/day) over its operational lifespan. Spread across 2,869 active days of whale inflows, Binance has facilitated over 53.2 million whale transactions. It has dwarfed competitors with 10 times Kraken’s activity and five times that of HTX. This massive two-way flow indicates Binance’s role not merely as a custody hub but as a trusted venue for large-scale, active trading, market-making, and arbitrage operations, confirming its depth and infrastructure as reliable for whales. For context, HTX Global follows with 24.1 million BTC in inflows across 6.8 million whale transactions, while Kraken recorded 23.7 million BTC in inflows with 765,000 whale transactions. Other notable platforms include Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Gemini, OKX, and Poloniex, but none match Binance’s scale.

ETF volume surges 5x above normal as traders await ProShares’ XRP futures fund launch. XRP nears $3 as traders speculate on $4 breakout amid revived momentum and whale activity. XRP Hits Five-Month High After 80% Climb XRP has surged nearly 80% from its April lows and shot up to almost $3 for the first time in several months. The token has increased by 8% in the last 24 hours and 25% weekly, making it one of the strongest assets in the market this week. Interestingly, the rally also marks a Bitcoin (BTC) breakout to a new record of $118,800, assisting in pushing up wider crypto prices. XRP has gained renewed momentum after months of muted movement, drawing fresh interest from both retail and institutional traders. Whale Transfers Fuel Speculation On-chain data shows several large XRP movements over the past 24 hours. Whale Alert flagged a 33 million XRP transfer (worth about $90 million) from Upbit to an unknown wallet. Another 40 million XRP, valued at over $100 million, moved between unidentified addresses, as CryptoPotato reported . In a separate transfer, 25.49 million XRP were sent from a private wallet to Coinbase. The cause behind such transactions is not clear, but these movements are likely to precede or follow price action. The timing has added to ongoing market speculation around the asset’s next move. XRP ETF Volume Spikes Ahead of Key Deadlines Trading activity has also picked up in XRP-linked exchange-traded products. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noted a sharp increase in volume. “The XRP ETFs seeing surge in volume today, like 4-5x the norm,” he posted. The 2x leveraged XRP fund ($XXRP) rose 27% on the day and 55% this week, with volume hitting $120 million.

2025-07-12T15:17:47,"Strategy Stock: A Leveraged Way To Play Bitcoin","Summary I expect Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by October 2025, with MSTR as a leveraged way to outperform Bitcoin during this bull cycle. MSTR's massive Bitcoin holdings and AI-powered analytics offerings drive strong investor sentiment and could boost long-term profitability. MSTR is riskier and more volatile than Bitcoin, but buying near cycle lows and selling near peaks can maximize gains. For steady income, MSTY offers high-yield monthly distributions, but I prefer MSTR for higher total returns; both have unique risks to consider. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is beginning to break out of its recent consolidation period from the first few months of the year. This could be the beginning of the next significant leg higher for Bitcoin over the next few months. I'm holding to my thesis that bitcoin will reach at least $150,000 by approximately October 2025. I see Strategy ( MSTR ) as a leveraged way to ride this leg higher, as MSTR tends to outperform Bitcoin during these bull markets. For example, over the past 5 years, Strategy's price increased by 3,484% while bitcoin's price increased by 1,175% . My thesis for this bitcoin price target is based on a 10x price increase from this cycle's low of about $15,000 from the end of 2022. The 10x target is based on the 2.618 Fibonacci level, which looks like a reasonable target for this cycle. Bitcoin's price tends to make lower percentage gains from the bottom to the top in each cycle. Bitcoin's price increased over 20x in the previous cycle, with the peak in 2021. So, I'm conservatively going with 10x for this cycle as the total percentage gains may not be as high as in previous cycles. I'm also sticking to the thesis that Bitcoin's price will peak around October 2025 . This thesis is based on the consistency of the length in days of the halving cycles from the price bottom to the peak. In the last two cycles, bitcoin's price bottom to price peak lasted exactly 1,064 days. The first cycle lasted a little longer at 1,148 days. So, if the current cycle is consistent with the past 2 cycles, 1,064 days from the price bottom in 2022 should take us to October 2025. Significant Outperformance MSTR vs. Bitcoin Price Performance (weekly chart) (TradingView) Strategy's weekly chart above illustrates why MSTR can be a more leveraged way to benefit from bitcoin's rise. MSTR tends to significantly outperform Bitcoin during the bull phases of the halving cycle. So, if bitcoin is about to make another leg higher, then the Strategy is likely to do the same, possibly by a much higher percentage gain. What's Behind Strategy's Strong Investor Sentiment? Strategy has been making significant purchases of Bitcoin over multiple years. As of June 29, 2025, MSTR held 597,325 bitcoins . At the recent price of $118,000 per bitcoin, this equates to $70.5 billion. Strategy owns the most bitcoin of any other corporation (not including exchanges). MSTR considers Bitcoin as its primary Treasury reserve asset . Strategy's large bitcoin holdings are important because the company can profit from bitcoin's rise in price. Bitcoin tends to outperform the S&P 500 ( SPY ) over the long term. Therefore, MSTR's large bitcoin holdings may provide an investing windfall for the company over the long term if bitcoin's price continues to outperform the broader markets. As a result, investors bid up the price of MSTR in hopes that the company will have increasing value and profitability as the price of bitcoin increases over the long term. Another reason for Strategy's strong positive investor sentiment could be a result of the company being involved with artificial intelligence [AI]. AI-related companies have had positive investor sentiment in recent years. Every time period has certain popular investing themes, and AI represents one of the current themes that is driving positive investor sentiment in the broader market. Strategy offers AI-powered analytics software/services in the United States and abroad. MSTR's Strategy One product enables non-technical users with the ability to obtain actionable insights for making key decisions. MSTR also offers other AI-related products and services to provide insights for its users. MSTR's AI offerings have the potential to grow revenue and earnings for the company over the long term. Currently, MSTR is unprofitable. However, the company is expected to become profitable in 2027, according to analysts' estimates. What MSTR does have going for it is its high gross margin [GM] of 71% . This is significantly higher than the sector median GM of 50%. The company just needs to make a few key tweaks to its operational performance to produce positive operating income. MSTR's high operational expenses are due to bitcoin's impairment losses. The company currently has a deferred tax liability when the market value of bitcoin is lower than MSTR's cost basis on the reporting date. However, this can disappear if bitcoin's market value increases to a level that exceeds MSTR's cost basis. If MSTR keeps purchasing more bitcoin at current prices, the company may continue to have deferred tax liability at reporting time. This could change if Bitcoin's price rises at a faster pace than MSTR's cost basis. Another Option For Bitcoin Exposure If you are the type of investor who likes steady monthly income, then you can consider the Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ). This is a high-yield ETF that is currently paying a 127% annual yield based on the past 12 months of distributions. The distributions are paid monthly and vary based on how well the fund managers are able to implement the long/short strategy using derivatives such as options on MSTR. MSTY holds some U.S. Treasury Notes while implementing its options strategy. There is no guarantee that the yield based on the past 12 months of distributions will turn out as generous over the next 12 months. The price of the underlying MSTY tends to decline in value over time. Therefore, investors should consider the total return to evaluate MSTY as a holding for their portfolios. MSTY also has an expense ratio of 0.99%, which should also be considered. MSTR vs. MSTY MSTR vs. MSTY adjusted for distributions (weekly chart) (TradingView) The chart above shows MSTR's outperformance vs. MSTY. The chart includes MSTY's monthly distribution payouts. If MSTY's distributions are taken out, then MSTY's return would only be 1.41% over the same period. It all comes down to personal preference and the goals of investors, whether to own MSTR or MSTY. Personally, I would prefer to own MSTR over MSTY since I strive for the highest gain regardless of distribution payouts. However, I do understand that others may prefer the steady monthly distributions associated with MSTY. Perhaps others would prefer some combination of both. Risks for Owning MSTR and/or MSTY MSTR can be more volatile than Bitcoin. As a result, MSTR tends to lose more value than Bitcoin during the bear markets (after the halving cycle price peaks). This means that Bitcoin can outperform MSTR over longer periods of time (holding through bull and bear market cycles). Since bitcoin's bear markets lead to significant losses, I would prefer to sell near the peak price based on technical analysis to maximize gains. The losses during bitcoin's bear markets could be 70% to 80%. MSTR's losses could be even greater, at about 90%. This is why gains can be maximized by buying near the low points and selling near the high points. You may not be able to capture the exact bottom or top, but higher gains can be locked in with this strategy. The risk for MSTY is that the underlying price tends to decline over time. The high yield has compensated for this with the high monthly distributions. There is no guarantee that future distributions will be as generous as in the past. Therefore, it is possible that it could take longer to recoup your initial investment in the form of monthly distributions. It is also possible that the price behavior of Bitcoin is not consistent with the length of the previous cycles. It is possible that the current bull cycle will be shorter than previous cycles, which could catch investors off guard. Final Thoughts on MSTR I see MSTR as a viable way to profit from Bitcoin's rise. I would choose to do this methodically by buying near bitcoin's halving cycle bottom and then selling near the cycle peak. This can be done by looking at Bitcoin and MSTR's monthly charts with the RSI and MACD indicators, which show the key turning points at the tops and bottoms of the price cycles. I will be watching the price action for Bitcoin and MSTR through the next couple of months, anticipating the peak of this cycle to be around October. Also, MSTR's AI offerings could help increase sentiment for the stock if it leads to stronger revenue and profitability over the long term.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800857-strategy-stock-a-leveraged-way-to-play-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ZRX|MARKET","BTC-USD|MSTY|MSTR",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T15:15:53,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Attention as Bitcoin Hits 800K Daily Active Wallets","As Bitcoin price continues its explosive run—now boasting over 800,000 daily active wallets and trading around monthly highs—one new crypto project is quickly stealing the spotlight. While Bitcoin continues to show resilience and strength, market demand is shifting toward platforms that offer structured yield opportunities—particularly among whales and institutional-grade investors seeking strong returns in the long-term. Top analysts are now focusing on MAGACOIN FINANCE . With its presale stage now live and demand surging, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about new cryptocurrencies of Q3 2025. Audited by HashEx, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the top choices among 1% whales of the market. It is a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin which has become one of the best cryptos to buy now. Bitcoin Price Today: Surge Fuels Broader Market Interest Bitcoin’s recent surge came in response to easing tensions in the Middle East—particularly a surprise ceasefire between Iran and Israel—and a fresh wave of institutional inflows. Though prices briefly dipped below weekly lows during geopolitical flare-ups, the rebound was quick, and investor sentiment remains largely bullish. Adding fuel to the rally, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve , partially backed by Bitcoin seized by the U.S. government. While the announcement triggered short-term volatility (with a 5% dip), the market stabilized and quickly regained ground. Meanwhile, long-time “whale” holders have begun offloading Bitcoin, selling over 500,000 BTC . Institutions—ranging from ETFs to multinational corporations—are picking up the slack, helping reduce volatility and positioning Bitcoin as a long-term, stable investment asset. According to Standard Chartered , Bitcoin could climb as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025 , with long-term projections going up to $266,000 by 2030 . High-profile investors like Robert Kiyosaki and Elon Musk are fueling this momentum, with Musk rumored to be increasing his BTC holdings. And in a positive regulatory turn, the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act , offering clarity and legal groundwork for stablecoins—a move widely interpreted as a green light for broader crypto adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Heats Up, Gains Strong Demand Against this bullish market backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured the attention of thousands of traders, influencers, and crypto analysts. Currently in its presale , the project is seeing rapid buy-ins and rising prices , with many early rounds already sold out in record time. Key Highlights: Presale Live: Prices are increasing every few hours as demand soars. The presale is already attracting tens of thousands of wallet trackers, with higher-than-average purchase volumes per investor. Unique Narrative: Positioned as a political meme coin , MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into viral U.S. political culture with a capped supply of 170 billion tokens and a zero-tax model —a combination designed to attract both meme traders and serious investors. Strong Tokenomics: The project features no VC unlocks , strong anti-inflation mechanics , and has passed an independent audit by respected firm HashEx . Staking Rewards: An exclusive staking protocol is set to launch soon, offering high APY rewards for presale buyers—adding urgency to join early. Market Comparisons: Analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to early-stage breakouts like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE , but with a more focused narrative and cleaner tokenomics. It’s also being eyed as a high-upside alternative to coins like XRP, Solana , and Cardano , which are currently facing ecosystem challenges. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin thriving and institutional confidence at an all-time high, the broader crypto market is ripe for new breakout projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be one of those standout contenders—riding a wave of momentum with a unique meme-driven twist, strong tokenomics, and rapidly growing community engagement. That said, if MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers on its roadmap and secures key exchange listings later in 2025, it could be one of the biggest meme coin stories of the year.

2025-07-12T15:00:28,"Shiba Inu Bites Into Healthcare, $5,000 Dental Bill Paid In Memecoin","A patient in the United States has used Shiba Inu to pay a $5,000 dental bill, marking another step in crypto’s slow march into everyday payments. The transaction went through Zypto App, a popular wallet and payments service. According to reports, the user “paid for a nicer smile” by selecting Shiba Inu in the app’s bill‑pay feature. The identity of the patient and the clinic remain under wraps, but the move highlights a small yet growing group of businesses willing to accept meme coins for real‑world services. Payment Using Memecoin The process took just a few taps. Zypto converted the SHIB to US dollars and deposited the funds into the merchant’s account within 48 hours. That window gave the clinic full protection from crypto swings and kept their books simple. One user from the US just paid a $5,000 bill to their dental clinic using Shiba Inu. Yes — you can literally pay for a nicer smile with Zypto. You could even pay your AMEX bill too… for an even bigger smile Try it now: https://t.co/yH2nTXaksB pic.twitter.com/itVw1Tn9lL — Zypto App (@ZyptoApp) July 9, 2025 Michigan Clinic Joins Crypto Trend Back on June 18 this year, Amore Smiles—a Michigan‑based orthodontist group—became one of the first dental suppliers to officially accept Shiba Inu alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. The firm also offers telemedicine solutions, letting patients consult remotely. Traditional methods like cash and credit cards still handle most payments, but the addition of SHIB gives customers more choice. Amore Smiles has even started storing key patient data on a blockchain ledger, which it says can’t be tampered with. The company is filing for an FDA patent on its new Oral Clear Aligners design, making it one of the first patent‑seeking dental firms to take Shiba Inu. Buzz And Billing Beyond Dentistry Zypto didn’t stop at dental bills. The app teased that you could also settle your AMEX bill with crypto, hinting at broader plans to cover 10 or more service providers. That kind of marketing grabs headlines. Everyday people hear about someone paying $5,000 in crypto and they lean in. Still, volatility is a real worry. If Shiba Inu’s price dips suddenly, the payer risks topping up more coins before the 48‑hour window closes. And fees on crypto conversions can eat into the total, especially for larger bills. Outlook For Crypto Payments Critics say these one‑off cases won’t sway the majority of businesses, but advocates point to growing interest. According to Zypto, more merchants are asking how to plug into the blockchain-powered rails. Whether it’s for a dentist visit or an AMEX statement, the option exists. For now, most merchants still clear out to dollars immediately, which keeps them safe from price swings. Patients and customers, on the other hand, carry all the crypto risk up front. Based on reports, paying a dental bill in Shiba Inu is more than a novelty. It’s a test run for mainstream crypto payments. The question is whether later adopters will join in or stick with plastic and bank transfers. Right now, the choice is there. Whether it becomes routine is another story.

2025-07-12T15:00:00,"Missed the Crypto Presale Boom? Bitcoin Solaris Final Phase Includes 48-Hour Price Rollback and 0.5 BTC Rewards","Crypto veterans know the feeling. You spot a presale, think it’s too early, wait, and suddenly it launches 20x higher. That moment of “I should have gotten in” echoes louder than any bull run cheer. But just when you think the train has left the station, Bitcoin Solaris is throwing open the doors with one last chance, and it’s not your average token sale. It’s the final phase of a high-velocity launch, paired with rewards that sound more like a Vegas prize pool. Bitcoin Solaris: A Wealth Machine with Speed and Substance Bitcoin Solaris, or BTC-S , isn’t just a clone with hopes and hashtags. It is redefining the architecture of crypto with a dual-consensus model that splits into a Base Layer (PoW) and a Solaris Layer (DPoS). The result? Raw security from Proof of Work, and next-level speed and scale from Delegated Proof of Stake. The numbers speak loudly: Base Layer runs SHA-256, ensuring compatibility with existing mining rigs Solaris Layer hits up to 100,000 TPS with a 2-second finality window Block times as low as 15 seconds, with dynamic block sizes up to 32MB 21 validators rotate daily, with slashing penalties for malicious behavior This system creates a balance between performance and decentralization. You’re not sacrificing one to get the other, and that’s exactly why so many eyes are on it. Beyond the Boom: Why This Final Phase Matters Most presales drag on or fizzle. Not Bitcoin Solaris. With over $6.6 million already raised and 14,150 unique holders, the project is accelerating into its final sprint. The launch price is locked at $20, but the current price remains at $11. And here’s the twist: for 48 hours only, BTC-S is introducing a Price rollback that brings the entry point back down to $5. This is not a bonus or gimmick. It’s a deliberate move to reward last-minute believers and onboard thousands more before listing. A rare chance like this is why crypto communities are buzzing. Wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch Over 14K users have already joined, making this one of the most explosive presales this year Crypto Show covered it in a detailed review, highlighting how BTC-S is blending tech, timing, and community perfectly This Rollback Is for You BTC-S Drops to $5 to Thank Early Supporters Real-World Utility, Built In Unlike many coins that promise use cases “later,” BTC-S is launching with a real roadmap and real applications: DeFi tools like DEXs, lending, and synthetic assets Enterprise use for identity, logistics, and data Gaming integrations, NFT support, and IoT compatibility Smart contracts built in Rust, borrowing Solana’s speed and flexibility Healthcare, education, and real estate utility out of the box Every application on BTC-S leverages the fast Solaris Layer while syncing data through the secure Base Layer. That means real-world functionality with technical muscle. A Different Type of Mining The upcoming Solaris Nova App is central to the BTC-S ecosystem. It turns mobile phones into micro mining hubs, enabling participation from anyone, anywhere. And with the built-in mining calculator at bitcoinsolaris.com/calculator , users can preview real yield potential in seconds. Energy-efficient system reduces waste by 99.95 percent compared to traditional mining Validator set updates are transparent and automated Public dashboards and quarterly reports bring unmatched clarity to the network Tokenomics That Actually Make Sense Bitcoin Solaris follows a fixed-supply model capped at 21 million BTC-S, just like Bitcoin, but with smarter allocation. Here’s a quick snapshot: 66.66% allocated for mining over 90 years 20% for presale 5% to liquidity 2% each for ecosystem, community rewards, staking, and marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This structure means real scarcity, real distribution, and none of the pump-and-dump inflation we’ve seen plague other coins. Play to Win: 0.5 BTC and Daily Rewards Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just technical muscle. It’s fun, too. The Blockchain Gaming system allows every token holder to earn while engaging: Daily free spins with no purchase required Spend-based spin tiers with real rewards Up to 13% token bonuses, and one lucky tier offering 0.5 BTC No need to stake or lock funds to play Adds excitement, retention, and unique community value It’s proof that utility can be profitable and fun at the same time. This isn’t just speculation. It’s a strategy with rewards. Final Verdict: The Last Chance That Doesn’t Feel Like One Missed Ethereum under $10? Ignored Solana before it hit $1? You’re not alone. But here’s the curveball: Bitcoin Solaris is offering one last low-price entry with the 48-hour rollback, while also stacking technical innovation, real use cases, and direct rewards. This is not just the end of a presale. It might be the beginning of your biggest crypto win yet.

2025-07-12T15:00:00,"Bitcoin SOPR Signals More Gains Ahead Despite New ATH – Analyst","In the past week, Bitcoin has grabbed the major headlines as prices surge to a new all-time high of $118,856 following a market gain of 9.77%. In remarkable fashion, the premier cryptocurrency added an estimated $10,000 to its market value increasing its market cap to a solid $2.34 trillion. Interestingly, recent on-chain data suggest there may be more tailwind ahead backing Bitcoin’s ability to explore new price territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $118,000—But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns STH SOPR Sits At 1.02, Suggests Market Not Overheating In a recent quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a market analyst with username CryptoMe has shared some compelling insights on Bitcoin’s price trajectory amidst current market euphoria. As earlier stated, the flagship cryptocurrency experienced a significant price gain to brush nearly against the $120,000 mark. Despite this rise, CryptoMe notes that short-term holders’ spent output profit ratio (STH SOPR) indicates that this class of investors are yet to engage in significant profit-taking. For context, The STH-SOPR measures the ratio of realized profits or losses by investors who’ve held BTC for less than 155 days. A STH-SOPR reading above 1.0 indicates that BTC are being sold at a profit, while values below 1.0 indicate losses. Based on the chart below, sharp increases in this on-chain metric especially into the 1.05-1.20+ range (red zone) have correlated with profit-taking phases and can often precede local tops. However, the STH-SOPR currently sits at 1.02, suggesting that although some short-term holders are in profit, no aggressive market distribution has commenced. This development is particularly bullish considering the STH realized price is presently at $100,000 indicating these investors are 17%-18% in profit and are opting to hold for further price gains. Meanwhile, the analyst notes that this present on-chain situation aligns with the broader sentiment in the derivatives market. Open Interest is climbing, signaling growing participation, but funding rates remain neutral to slightly positive. This lack of extreme funding imbalances suggests that traders are not flooding the market with overleveraged long positions due to FOMO. CryptoMe explains that all these factors indicate the Bitcoin market is far from overheating and there is still potential for more growth ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Oscillator Predicts First Sell Pressure Level At $130,900 – Details BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,840 indicating a 3.40% in the past day but a slight 0.82% decline from the present all-time high. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 96.53% indicating a strong market activity behind the ongoing rally backing the potential for a continuation.

According to data from Farside, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total of $1.03 billion in inflows on Friday, following $1.17 billion the previous day, reflecting a growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin amid a strong price rally. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, noted that billion-dollar inflow days have been rare since the ETFs launched, with only seven such days recorded so far—two of which occurred within the past two days. The previous high before this week was on Jan. 17, with $1.07 billion in inflows. Thursday’s $1.17 billion inflow marked the second-largest single-day influx since inception, surpassed only by the $1.37 billion recorded on Nov. 7, 2024, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Institutional Demand Outpaces Bitcoin Supply Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Invest, noted on Friday that while the Bitcoin network produced approximately 450 Bitcoins on Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased nearly 10,000 Bitcoins on the same day. Similarly, Jan3 emphasized that on Wednesday, Bitcoin ETF demand was 22 times higher than the daily mined supply, indicating the intensity of institutional demand. “This demand is not sustainable at these price levels,” said Jan3 CEO Samson Mow, suggesting that the heightened demand could continue to pressure Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. The strong inflows came during a trading week that saw Bitcoin prices hit new all-time highs , reaching $112,000 on Wednesday and climbing further to $118,780 by Friday, according to CoinMarketCap data. The rising prices fueled investor interest, leading to $2.72 billion in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs over the week. Bitcoin ETFs Cumulative Inflows Hit Records The price rally also propelled BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) to surpass $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) on Thursday, making it the fastest ETF to reach that milestone in just 374 days, according to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT fund now generates more annual revenue than its flagship S&P 500 ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, reflecting the shifting focus toward crypto among investors. Total assets across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs have now crossed $140 billion for the first time. While Balchunas noted that the recent price surge contributed significantly to these figures, the consistent inflows signal the strengthening role of Bitcoin ETFs in the financial markets as institutional interest in crypto assets continues to accelerate.

2025-07-12T14:19:28,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is a Correction Coming or Will BTC Break $120K Next?","Bitcoin has decisively broken above its previous all-time high of $111K, triggering a powerful bullish rally toward the key $120K psychological resistance. However, as BTC approaches the $120K zone, profit-taking and distribution pressure may rise, increasing the likelihood of a short-term corrective pullback. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart After a prolonged consolidation phase, Bitcoin has decisively broken above its previous all-time high of $111K. This breakout was backed by a notable surge in buying activity, triggering a short-squeeze that accelerated the bullish momentum. As a result, Bitcoin rapidly climbed toward the psychologically significant $120K resistance level. While this move signals strong market confidence, the $120K region is a probable zone for profit-taking and distribution, which could temporarily slow down the rally. A short-term corrective phase is therefore expected, likely pulling the price back toward the $111K region to retest the breakout level. Based on the Fibonacci retracement tool, key resistance levels ahead are located at $120K and $131K. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin printed a powerful bullish candle, decisively breaking above both the descending wedge pattern and the previous ATH at $111K. Following a minor pullback to retest the breakout zone, the price resumed its upward surge, reaching the $120K mark. Such impulsive rallies are often followed by short-term corrections, as traders begin to realize profits. A healthy retracement would likely target the 0.5 ($113K) to 0.618 ($111K) Fibonacci levels, a key zone where the market may stabilize and build momentum for the next leg up. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets As Bitcoin trades at all-time highs near $120K, an intriguing insight emerges from the Short-Term Holder SOPR metric. This indicator, which measures realized profits from investors who’ve held BTC for less than 155 days, remains notably muted, especially when compared to November 2024, when Bitcoin first reached $111K. Despite the recent surge, short-term holders aren’t cashing out aggressively, indicating that profit-taking is still relatively limited. Historically, the end of a bullish cycle is often accompanied by elevated SOPR values due to massive profit realization. But for now, the data suggests the market isn’t overheated, and the current rally could still have room to grow if new demand enters.

2025-07-12T14:15:03,"CKpool rolls out low-latency pool after solo miner racks up 3.175 BTC reward","CKpool developer and administrator Con Kolivas announced on X the launch of a new solo BTC pool located in Brisbane, Australia. The goal of this Bitcoin mining pool is to service Oceania and Asia-Pacific miners. The new AU solo pool is separated from the main CK pool and the EU solo BTC mining pool due to latency and performance reasons. As per the X post , the AU BTC pool will operate with low latency. Con Kolivas stated that blocks generated from the AU BTC mining pool will be propagated between other sibling pools. Moreover, the AU BTC blocks will carry the same signature from the main CK pool but with the prefix “ckpoolau.” The developer clarified that miners will have the option to utilize other sibling pools for backup. The main solo CK pool covers most of the world, but with relatively lower latency. AU pool is likely Bitaxe dominated Con Kolivas predicted that the AU pool will comprise mostly of Bitaxe mining rigs. He also predicted that the AU pool will have the lowest hashrate compared to other solo CK pools. This is due to high electricity costs in Australia. Currently, the average cost of residential electricity in Australia is AUD 33 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while commercial electricity costs between AUD 25 and AUD 45 cents per kWh. In the United States, the average residential electricity rate is USD 12.89 cents per kWh (AUD 19.6 cents), compared with AUD 33 cents per kWh in Australia . This is 60% of what Australians pay for each kilowatt-hour of electricity. The average Bitaxe rig hashrate ranges between 0.4–1.2 Terahash (TH/s). This means the electricity costs in Australia for running a Bitaxe solo miner will be AUD 16 cents per day at the average residential rate of AUD 33 cents, and between AUD 12 cents and AUD 22 cents per day at commercial rates of AUD 25 to 45 cents per kWh. While the daily costs seem minimal, the chance of solving a Bitcoin block and winning the mining fees of 3.175 BTC will take 14,075 years based on calculations from SoloChance . A Bitaxe rig tends to sell for roughly USD 150 each, and committed hobbyists usually run a cluster of 2 to 4 BTC rigs. Bitaxe Miner Solo Bitcoin miner racks in 3.175 BTC with 200 Ph/s Yesterday, Con Kolivas congratulated a solo miner for winning 3.175 BTC after solving block number 904,989. The miner solved the 302nd solo block with a huge hashrate of 200 petahashes per second (Ph/s). Con Kolivas wrote, “A miner of this size would solve a block once every ~35 days on average at current mining difficulty.” He further clarified that a miner of this size is probably renting hashrate. This is because the high hashrate of 200 Ph/s is much higher than the hashrate of available mining hardware. The developer said that this miner started mining Bitcoin on January 9, 2025.

2025-07-12T14:10:10,"Bitcoin Dominance: Unveiling the Surprising Strength Amidst Altcoin Rallies","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Dominance: Unveiling the Surprising Strength Amidst Altcoin Rallies The cryptocurrency world is a dynamic realm, constantly evolving and often defying conventional wisdom. In a recent development that has captivated the crypto market, Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance has demonstrated remarkable resilience, holding firm despite significant surges across the altcoin landscape. This intriguing phenomenon challenges traditional market interpretations and raises a pivotal question: What exactly is driving this unique market behavior, and what does it signal for the future of digital assets? Bitcoin Dominance: Unpacking Its Enduring Grip For many seasoned observers, a drop in Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) has historically been a strong precursor to an “altcoin season”—a period where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin significantly. However, as crypto analyst Matthew Hyland pointed out, and as reported by Cointelegraph, the current scenario paints a different picture. Despite recent impressive rallies from various altcoins, BTC.D has not seen the expected dramatic decline. Data from TradingView indeed shows a slight dip of merely 1.53% last week, a relatively minor fluctuation given the substantial gains recorded by many altcoins. This steadfastness in Bitcoin’s market share suggests a robust underlying strength. It implies that while altcoins are attracting considerable attention and capital, Bitcoin continues to be the primary gateway and holding asset for a large segment of investors. This stability in dominance, even amidst a vibrant altcoin surge, is a crucial indicator of the overall health and maturity of the digital asset space. Decoding the Altcoin Season: Is This Time Different? Traditionally, an altcoin season kicks off when investors rotate profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, causing BTC.D to fall sharply. This current cycle, however, presents a compelling deviation. The altcoin rally has occurred concurrently with Bitcoin maintaining its strong market position. This simultaneous growth suggests that the market isn’t merely reallocating existing capital from BTC to altcoins. Instead, a more significant trend appears to be at play: the inflow of new capital into the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Consider this: if existing capital were simply moving from Bitcoin to altcoins, Bitcoin’s dominance would plummet. The fact that it hasn’t, even with altcoins posting double-digit or even triple-digit gains in some cases, strongly supports the theory of fresh money entering the market. This new capital is not exclusively flowing into Bitcoin, nor is it solely targeting altcoins; it’s expanding the entire market pie, allowing both segments to grow in parallel. New Capital Inflows: Fueling the Broader Cryptocurrency Trends The concept of “new capital” is pivotal in understanding current cryptocurrency trends. This could stem from various sources: Institutional Investors: Increased adoption of crypto by traditional finance firms, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. Retail Enthusiasm: A renewed wave of interest from individual investors, perhaps spurred by positive news cycles or mainstream adoption. Stablecoin Inflows: A rise in stablecoin market capitalization, often indicating sidelined capital waiting to be deployed into volatile assets. When new money flows into the market, it has the potential to elevate the valuations of both Bitcoin and altcoins. This broad-based liquidity can sustain rallies across the board, creating a more inclusive bull market where the gains are not zero-sum between BTC and its smaller counterparts. It’s a sign of a maturing market, where different segments can thrive simultaneously, rather than one at the expense of the other. What Does This Mean for BTC Price and Your Investment Strategy? For investors, understanding this dynamic is key. If new capital is indeed the primary driver, it bodes well for the long-term outlook of the entire crypto space, including the BTC price. A rising tide lifts all boats, and a continuous influx of fresh funds could push Bitcoin to new highs while also providing ample room for altcoins to flourish. However, it also presents a nuanced challenge: how to position your portfolio. While the “new capital” theory is optimistic, market dynamics can shift rapidly. A sudden decrease in new inflows or a rotation of existing capital could still impact dominance and altcoin performance. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors Given these unique market conditions, what steps can investors take? Monitor Bitcoin Dominance Closely: While it’s holding strong, a significant break below key support levels could still signal a more aggressive altcoin rotation. Diversify Wisely: Consider a balanced portfolio that includes both Bitcoin for its foundational strength and well-researched altcoins with strong fundamentals and innovative use cases. Research Beyond Hype: In a market fueled by new capital, it’s easy for less robust projects to get carried away in the general euphoria. Focus on projects with clear utility, active development, and solid communities. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and major industry developments that could influence capital flows. Practice Risk Management: As always, invest only what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital during volatile periods. A New Chapter for the Crypto Market? The current resilience of Bitcoin Dominance amidst surging altcoins is a fascinating development, hinting at a more profound shift in the crypto market. Matthew Hyland’s observation of new capital inflows provides a compelling explanation, suggesting that we might be witnessing a more expansive and inclusive bull market. This isn’t just a simple rotation of funds; it’s potentially a signal of growing mainstream adoption and increasing liquidity across the board. While the future remains unpredictable, this unique market phase offers exciting opportunities for investors who are prepared to understand and adapt to these evolving cryptocurrency trends. The stage is set for what could be a truly transformative period for digital assets.

2025-07-12T14:10:04,"Santiment Announces the Start of Altseason","Market data points to the beginning of the altcoin season, but there are worrying signals. This was announced by specialists at Santiment. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of over $118,000. Against this backdrop, most of the leading cryptocurrencies outperformed Bitcoin in terms of price performance over the past seven days. The largest Ethereum wallets (10,000 ETH or more) collectively own 75.74% of the coin's total supply. This is the highest level of concentration of the asset among whales since May 2017, and it acts as a ”powerful bullish signal,” the company's experts noted. The number of XRP wallets storing more than 1 million coins reached an all-time high of 2,743. The volume of cryptocurrency they hold has also increased. Both trends are a ”very positive sign” for the asset from Ripple, Santiment emphasized. Analysts estimate that the altcoin season will continue as long as Bitcoin holds above the key psychological level of $110,000. In such a situation, traders are comfortable redistributing profits from the growth of digital gold into other coins, they added. Experts advised remaining cautious The value of the MVRV metric for Bitcoin is one of the alarming signals. The ratio of market price to realized value of the asset has already surpassed the value recorded in May, which was followed by a correction after the previous all-time high. Santiment also drew attention to the leadership in weekly growth by the meme-coin segment—plus 17%. This potentially points to the concluding phase of the market rally, experts believe. ”When speculative assets lead the market, it could mean that greed is peaking,” they noted. For Ethereum, an alarming signal is the extremely optimistic sentiment regarding the asset. This usually indicates that a short-term price peak is approaching, Santiment said. CoinMarketCap's altcoin index is at 27. The value indicates that traders still favor Bitcoin. The dominance of the first cryptocurrency is 62.5%. Analyst Matthew Hyland noted that despite this, altcoins have shown impressive growth. However, the real rally will begin after Bitcoin's dominance is reduced to 45%, he believes.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9912/santiment-announces-the-start-of-altseason,"ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH","News|Altcoins",cryptocompare

Minnesota Vikings linebacker Dallas Turner was duped out of $240,000 by a scammer who seemed to have intimate knowledge of his account, reports the Star Tribune. Someone posing as a Chase banker called Turner and made him think his account was under attack. Authorities are asking Chase to determine whether bank employees are involved because the scammer “was able to obtain sensitive account details including Turner’s full name, linked phone numbers and [his] LLC account info.” The fraudster called Turner on February 19th, alleging an impostor was attempting a wire transfer. Turner, convinced of the threat, rushed to a Chase branch and wired $120,000 to “Island Food Truck LLC.” That same day, he visited a separate Chase branch and transferred $120,000 to “CNL FL LLC.” Police say they have several suspects and charges are pending. To date, around $2,500 of Turner’s cash has been recovered.

2025-07-12T14:00:32,"Analyst Shares Stellar (XLM) Next Move, Says Be Ready","Stellar Lumens (XLM) is gaining renewed attention following a bold technical analysis by crypto strategist Egrag Crypto. In a detailed chart shared via X, Egrag outlines a long-term bullish setup that suggests XLM is gearing up for a major breakout. With XLM currently trading around $0.395 as of report time, the technical and fundamental indicators appear to be aligning, prompting the analyst to issue a clear call to action: “Be ready.” Egrag Crypto’s Macro Chart: The Cup and Handle Formation Egrag’s chart presents a compelling long-term structure that spans nearly a decade. At the heart of the analysis is a massive cup and handle pattern, a formation often associated with powerful bullish reversals. The “cup” is defined by a rounded base stretching from 2018 to 2023, while the emerging “handle” forms the final phase before a potential breakout. #XLM – Next Move: Be Ready pic.twitter.com/bk6DmygYS6 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 11, 2025 According to Egrag, XLM has repeatedly bounced from a reliable diagonal support trendline, marking key accumulation zones along the way. Each previous bounce has led to significant rallies, and XLM’s current position suggests another move is building. The price is now approaching the upper boundary of this structure, signaling a potential breakout point. Egrag identifies three major upside targets: Target 1 near $0.45 Target 2 around $0.65 Target 3 extending to $1.11, with an ultimate Fibonacci extension near $1.51 With XLM currently holding above the $0.39 mark, the asset appears to be entering the breakout phase highlighted in Egrag’s forecast. Market Momentum: XLM Price Surges Past Key Resistance Over the past week, XLM has surged by more than 25%, outperforming many other mid-cap cryptocurrencies. The rally comes as Bitcoin soars past $118,000, lifting broader market sentiment. XLM’s breakout above the $0.37 resistance level has brought renewed confidence to traders, many of whom now see $0.45 as the next technical target. The price has also re-entered the upper zone of a multi-year ascending channel, adding further credibility to Egrag’s projection. If current momentum holds, a move toward the $0.65 and $1.10 zones may follow in the medium term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strengthening Fundamentals: Institutional Adoption and Soroban Egrag’s bullish outlook also coincides with a string of positive developments within the Stellar ecosystem. Notably, Franklin Templeton recently tokenized over $445 million in U.S. Treasuries on the Stellar network, marking one of the largest real-world asset integrations in crypto to date. Adding to the momentum, Stellar’s upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade, which will introduce Soroban, its native smart contracts platform, is set for release in August 2025. Soroban is expected to enable advanced DeFi capabilities and programmable assets, broadening Stellar’s utility and appeal to developers and institutions alike. Stellar Aligns for Breakout, Are You Ready? Egrag Crypto’s long-range analysis presents a technically and fundamentally supported case for a major move in XLM . With the price nearing critical resistance and institutional activity on the rise, Stellar may be on the verge of a breakout not seen since its previous cycle highs. While nothing in crypto is ever certain, the combination of historical support, bullish technical patterns, and real-world use cases makes one thing clear: this could be Stellar’s moment.

2025-07-12T13:58:03,"Theft of $140 Million from Brazilian Banks, Telegram Outages, and Other Cybersecurity Events","Brazilian Banks Lose $140 Million Due to Collusive Employee On July 7, one of the largest hacker attacks on the banking sector in the past year was reported. Cybercriminals stole approximately $140 million from six Brazilian financial institutions by using the credentials of a C&M Software employee. The incident occurred on June 30, when the attackers bribed João Nazareno Roque and gained access to the system using his credentials. According to police, he also relayed instructions to perform certain actions that ensured the attack's success. Roque initially received $920 for his involvement. Later, following the attackers' recommendations, he ran commands inside C&M's infrastructure and earned an additional $1,850, according to reports. Roque attempted to conceal his activities by changing cell phones every 15 days. However, on July 3, he was detained in São Paulo. It is estimated that at least $30–40 million of the stolen funds were converted into crypto-assets. According to an investigation by on-chain detective ZachXBT, the attackers converted the funds into BTC, ETH, and USDT through Latin American OTC and crypto exchanges. Basketball Player Suspected of Cyber Extortion On July 9, news emerged of the detention of Russian professional basketball player Daniil Kasatkin. According to media reports, he was arrested on June 21 at Charles de Gaulle Airport in France, at the request of U.S. authorities. The athlete is accused of acting as a negotiator in a hacker network that used ransomware. Kasatkin remains in custody, and U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition to face charges. His lawyer has declared the athlete's innocence. The name of the hacker group has not been disclosed. Between 2020 and 2022, the attackers reportedly carried out more than 900 attacks on various organizations, including two federal agencies. McDonald's AI Bot Vulnerability Led to Leaked Employee Hiring Database According to Wired, researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry discovered critical vulnerabilities in the McHire system on June 9. The platform, which hires employees for McDonald's, uses an AI bot named Olivia. Using simple passwords like ”123456,” the researchers gained access to the admin panel of the platform's developer, Paradox.ai. It contained a database with 64 million records, including job seekers' names, emails, and phone numbers. Since 2019, the platform had been accessible without two-factor authentication. Paradox.ai acknowledged the leak and stated that the account was not used by third parties other than the researchers themselves. The company promised to implement a bug bounty program to prevent similar incidents in the future. McDonald's, for its part, said it fixed the vulnerability the day it was discovered. Carroll said he only found out about this ”appalling level of security” because he was interested in the decision to vet potential employees through an AI bot and a personality test. ”It seemed particularly dystopian to me compared to the normal hiring process, right? That's what prompted me to dig deeper. I started applying for the job, and within 30 minutes we had full access to virtually every application form ever submitted to McDonald's in recent years,” he emphasized in a comment to Wired. Bitcoin Depot Failed to Keep Track of 27,000 Customers' Data Bitcoin Depot, an operator of a Bitcoin ATM network with more than 17,000 devices in the US, Canada, and Australia, has notified customers of a personal data leak. Suspicious activity on the network was first discovered on June 23, 2023, and the company's internal investigation concluded in July 2024. U.S. law enforcement requested that public disclosure be delayed until their own investigation was completed. According to a letter sent to victims, the attackers obtained documents belonging to approximately 27,000 customers who had completed KYC procedures. The type of data leaked varies from person to person, but can include: Full name Phone number Driver's license number Residential address Date of birth Email address No financial compensation or identity theft protection is being offered, as the risks are associated with cryptocurrency assets.

2025-07-12T13:54:34,"Bitcoin’s Is Now Bigger Than Google and Silver: Amazon Targeted Next","The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has long expanded beyond its own industry and has maintained a place within the top largest assets by that metric for a while. Its latest price surge recorded earlier this week allowed it to create history by charting a new all-time high close to $119,000. Although this move has seen some resistance and BTC is now down by over a grand, its market cap has overtaken the second-largest precious metal and one of the most influential companies in the world. BTC Above Silver, Alphabet Who could have predicted such a development 15 years ago when a peer-to-peer electronic system was launched by an unknown creator? Or a decade ago when it was being ridiculed by countless traditionalists. Or even three years ago, when it had become more mainstream after a surge to roughly $70,000 but then crumbled under pressure to under $20,000 within months amid industry-wide wipeouts, scams, failures, and everything in between. Fast forward to July 2025, this same network, which was once a mere decentralized system for sharing value over the Internet, has become a global phenomenon. It has been adopted by countries, world leaders use it in their election campaigns, the largest wealth managers have launched ETFs tracking its underlying asset, and more. And speaking about that underlying asset, its price just made history this week by skyrocketing to a fresh all-time high (for the third time this year) at almost $119,000. Naturally, this pushed its market capitalization to new peaks of its own as the metric stands close to $2.350 trillion now (that’s a trillion with a T). Data from CompaniesMarketCap shows that this same asset, which was not that long ago worth pennies, has now become the sixth-largest global asset by market capitalization. Its most recent victims on the way up include Alphabet (market cap of $2.192 trillion) and silver ($2.2 trillion). Assets by Market Cap. Source: CompaniesMarketCap The graph above shows that Amazon stands next in line if bitcoin’s price ascent continues, while Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA are way further ahead. Gold remains the indisputed leader, with a market cap of well over $22.5 trillion. Where’s ETH? The second-largest cryptocurrency also experienced a substantial price revival this week, hitting $3,000 for the first time since February. Its market capitalization climbed to over $350 billion, which places it near the top 30 assets by this metric.

2025-07-12T13:50:22,"Swedish Bitcoin Treasury Capital: A Strategic Accumulation of 4.4 BTC Signals Confidence","BitcoinWorld Swedish Bitcoin Treasury Capital: A Strategic Accumulation of 4.4 BTC Signals Confidence The world of digital assets continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with traditional finance increasingly recognizing the long-term value proposition of cryptocurrencies. In a recent development that underscores this growing trend, Bitcoin Treasury Capital , a Swedish-listed company dedicated to holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset, announced another significant purchase. This time, the firm added an additional 4.4 BTC to its reserves, bringing its total holdings to 152 BTC as of July 11. This seemingly modest acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal of sustained confidence and a testament to the ongoing trend of institutional integration of Bitcoin into corporate balance sheets. Understanding Bitcoin Treasury Capital and Its BTC Accumulation Strategy Bitcoin Treasury Capital isn’t your average investment fund. It’s a company specifically designed to provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly listed entity. This unique structure offers a regulated and transparent way for individuals and institutions to participate in the Bitcoin market without directly managing the complexities of self-custody or navigating less regulated exchanges. Their consistent BTC Accumulation strategy, exemplified by this latest 4.4 BTC purchase, highlights a long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. Why do companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital opt for this strategy? Here are a few key reasons: Long-Term Vision: They believe in Bitcoin’s potential for significant appreciation over time, viewing it as a superior asset for treasury management compared to traditional fiat currencies, which are susceptible to inflation. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets beyond traditional stocks, bonds, and cash, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Institutional Appeal: By operating as a listed company, they offer a familiar and accessible entry point for institutional investors who might otherwise be hesitant to directly engage with the crypto market. Transparency: Regular announcements of their holdings, like the one made via X, provide transparency to their shareholders and the broader market, building trust and confidence. The Broader Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The move by Bitcoin Treasury Capital is part of a much larger and increasingly significant global trend: the adoption of Bitcoin by corporations for their treasury reserves. While pioneers like MicroStrategy famously led the charge, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC, a growing number of public and private companies are following suit, albeit often on a smaller scale. This shift represents a maturation of the Bitcoin ecosystem, moving beyond individual retail speculation to legitimate corporate financial strategy. Consider the impact of these Corporate Bitcoin Holdings : Validation of Bitcoin: Each company that adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet lends further credibility to the asset, transforming it from a niche digital curiosity into a recognized financial instrument. Increased Liquidity and Stability: As more companies hold Bitcoin for the long term, it can contribute to market stability by reducing the circulating supply available for short-term trading. New Investment Avenues: The existence of treasury companies creates new, regulated investment vehicles for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin without direct ownership. This trend is not without its challenges, including Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility and evolving regulatory landscapes. However, the benefits of potential long-term growth and inflation hedging are proving to be compelling enough for forward-thinking companies to embrace this new asset class. Sweden’s Progressive Stance: A Hub for Swedish Bitcoin Investment? It’s particularly interesting that Bitcoin Treasury Capital hails from Sweden. Sweden has a unique position in the global financial landscape, often lauded for its technological adoption and progressive approach to digital innovation. While the country’s central bank, the Riksbank, has been exploring its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-krona, its private sector has also shown a notable openness to decentralized digital assets. This environment fosters a fertile ground for Swedish Bitcoin Investment . The presence of a listed company like Bitcoin Treasury Capital suggests a level of regulatory clarity or at least acceptance that allows such ventures to thrive. This contrasts with some other nations where regulatory uncertainty can stifle innovation in the crypto space. Sweden’s digital-first mindset and high rates of digital payment adoption may also contribute to a greater understanding and acceptance of cryptocurrencies among its populace and businesses. Unpacking the Significance: What Does This Mean for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The consistent purchases by companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital are critical indicators of the broader movement towards Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . While 4.4 BTC might seem like a small amount compared to the vast sums traded daily, it’s the consistency and the underlying strategic intent that truly matter. It signifies that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset but is increasingly viewed as a legitimate component of a well-diversified corporate treasury. Key takeaways for the future of institutional adoption: Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: Institutions are actively seeking alternatives to traditional fiat and bonds, especially in an era of quantitative easing and inflation concerns. Growing Confidence in Custody Solutions: The rise of secure, institutional-grade custody solutions makes it safer for companies to hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. Maturing Regulatory Frameworks: As regulations slowly become clearer in various jurisdictions, it reduces risk and encourages more traditional financial players to enter the space. Educational Shift: There’s a growing understanding among corporate boards and financial managers about Bitcoin’s fundamental properties and its potential long-term value. Each new company, big or small, that publicly adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to a network effect, making it more acceptable and even expected for others to consider doing the same. This incremental accumulation by various entities builds a robust foundation for Bitcoin’s long-term integration into the global financial system. Conclusion: A Steady March Towards Digital Asset Integration The latest acquisition of 4.4 BTC by Bitcoin Treasury Capital , while a single data point, is a compelling piece of evidence in the larger narrative of Bitcoin’s journey into mainstream finance. It reinforces the idea that companies, particularly those with a forward-thinking approach, are increasingly comfortable with and committed to holding digital assets as part of their treasury strategy. This ongoing BTC Accumulation by entities like Bitcoin Treasury Capital from Sweden signifies not just a belief in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation, but a strategic decision to embrace a new paradigm of corporate finance. As more companies follow this path, the landscape of global treasury management will undoubtedly continue to transform, with Bitcoin playing an ever more central role.

It was a playful way to say something clear, don’t ignore XRP’s potential. If XRP reaches that price, it would mean a massive 8X jump, or about 767% gain from where it is now.

2025-07-12T13:45:49,"Miners can't keep up with demand: The Bitcoin supply squeeze is getting real","While Bitcoin (BTC) rips through fresh all-time highs, climbing above $118K and $120K within reach, the metrics of the rally are getting far more complex than just bullish sentiment. On-chain data shows an emerging imbalance in supply and demand reminiscent of late 2020. BTC price is now up by 105% over the last year and leading the altcoins with massive bullish sentiments. The cumulative crypto market cap is nearing the $3.7 trillion mark with a 24-hour trading volume of around $163 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin dominance is on the high side of 64%, and the fear and greed index is flashing “Greed” among traders. Miners can’t keep up with demand As per the Glassnode data, wallets holding less than 100 BTC are now accumulating Bitcoin at a combined pace of 19,300 BTC per month. This number is already 6,000 more BTC than miners are issuing monthly (13,400 BTC). It added that this wide base of retail and high-net-worth holders is absorbing more than 100% of the net new supply. If some Bitcoin remains in the market, then ETFs , institutions, or treasuries are gobbling up the rest. Bitcoin balance on exchanges is also dropping, and the supply shock is getting real. Exchange balances are falling, long-term holders are growing, and miner issuance is unable to keep up. Long-term holders (LTHs) are absorbing more BTC than miners can mint, and they’re not even thinking about selling. Source: Coinglass The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for long-term holders is currently sitting at 0.69, which is below the threshold red zone of 0.75. In the last cycle, the market spent 228 days in the euphoria zone, and this cycle, just 30 days. Even short-term holders, the classic profit-takers, are yet to show any signs of dumping. Their average entry price is around $100,000, which means they’re sitting on 17-18% gains. Bitcoin boom turns corporate heads There’s the macro picture, which implies that Bitcoin isn’t just gaining in price, it’s gaining legitimacy. Institutional investors are leaning in while corporates are converting cash into BTC. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) turns out to be the poster child of corporate Bitcoin accumulation. It now owns nearly 600,000 BTC and holds a $28 billion paper profit. Only Satoshi and BlackRock hold more than MSTR. But unlike BlackRock, which holds BTC via its ETF ( IBIT ) on behalf of investors, Strategy holds BTC outright on its balance sheet. Saylor isn’t shy about it, and when BTC hit an all-time high yesterday, he posted: “The halls of eternity echo with the cries of those who sold their Bitcoin.” Other companies are riding the same wave. Japan’s Metaplanet owns over 15,500 BTC, now worth nearly $1.83 billion, up from $284 million. El Salvador, the original Bitcoin nation, now holds 6,234 BTC, valued at $733 million, with a $232 million paper profit. Semler Scientific (SMLR) has followed the BTC-on-balance-sheet strategy too. It hodls 4,636 BTC and $160 million in gains. France’s Blockchain Group is in the mix with 900 BTC, up $30.5 million on paper. This rally wasn’t isolated to Bitcoin. Ethereum broke the $3,000 mark again, and XRP, SOL, DOGE are all rallying with it. XRP price spiked by 25% in the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $2.78 at press time.

The President slapped 30% levy on the two trading partners, which will take effect from Aug. 1, according to letters Trump posted on his Truth Social account. ""Mexico has been helping me secure the border. BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,"" Trump wrote in a letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. In another letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump called the relationship with the EU far from reciprocal. Early this week, Trump issued new tariffs for several countries, including South Korea, Japan, Canada and Brazil, along with a 50% tariff on copper, triggering volatility in the market for the red metal. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded around $17,400 following Trump's announcement, down 0.6% from the European session high of $18,200. Prices have failed to establish a foothold above $118,000 multile times since Friday's early Asian trading hours, CoinDesk data show. Ether (ETH), the second-largest token, traded 1% lower on the day (UTC) at $2,930, having put in an indecisive doji candle Friday. Solana's SOL and DOGE traded over 2% lower while BNB was down 0.7%. Meanwhile, payments-focused XRP traded relatively resilient, flashing a 1.78% gain as of writing. The weak tone followed intense bullish price action mid-week that saw BTC blow past the long-held resistance at $110K, prompting renewed risk-taking in the broader crypto market. Some analysts anticipated a continued indecisive price action over the weekend. ""Expectations this weekend are we chop around in tight range today.

2025-07-12T13:30:13,"Dogecoin Megaphone Pattern Confirms Price Blowup, ‘Don’t Miss This Last Rally’—Analyst","Crypto analyst TradingShot has drawn attention to a bullish pattern for Dogecoin, indicating that a significant price surge is on the horizon. The analyst suggested that this could be the final leg up for the foremost meme coin and advised market participants not to miss it. Dogecoin Eyes Parabolic Rally With Megaphone Pattern In a TradingView post, TradingShot predicted that Dogecoin could rally to as high as $1.25. He noted that the meme coin has been trading in a bullish Megaphone pattern within a channel up. The analyst added that the recent rebound on June 16 on the weekly MA200 is a higher low at the bottom of both patterns. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price To Jump Double-Digits To $0.2 With the 1-week Relative Strength Index (RSI) also rebounding on its long-term support zone, TradingShot declared that Dogecoin is most likely at the start of a new bullish leg. He noted that this could be the final rally that will shape this cycle’s top. Meanwhile, the analyst claimed that DOGE is targeting $1.25 because the previous two bullish legs peaked on the 3.618 Fibonacci extension of the last decline. He told market participants that they can settle for $0.8 if they wish to pursue a target within the Channel up. A rally to both $0.8 and $1.25 would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for Dogecoin, whose current ATH is at $0.73. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach these targets in the first half of next year. Dogecoin is expected to maintain a steady climb from now till then as it reaches those targets. The meme coin has already begun another uptrend following Bitcoin’s rally to a new ATH. DOGE has again reclaimed the $ 0.20 psychological price level and could potentially reach its last local high at around $0.26. DOGE Against Its Bitcoin Pair In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the DOGE/BTC chart is sitting in a historical zone of support with the monthly time frame indicators fully reset. The analyst indicated that this was possibly the best setup for Dogecoin, one that could spark a massive run for the meme coin. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Major Dogecoin Price Rally After Breaking 50-Day Trendline Meanwhile, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that the Dogecoin-to-Bitcoin chart might show a God candle this month. This God candle could spark a DOGE season, when the meme coin is expected to outperform the flagship crypto. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that DOGE could rally to as high as $9 during this period. Meanwhile, he highlighted the $0.2 support level as being crucial for this lift-off for the meme coin.

2025-07-12T13:28:56,"What Happens When Bitcoin Solaris Hits LBank? Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Experts Project Immediate 150% Surge","The crypto market has always loved a plot twist. Just when investors were tracking Ethereum’s slow and steady rise to a projected $3,296 by 2030, another player has stepped onto the stage with a bolder promise and a tighter timeline. Bitcoin Solaris, a coin that once hovered quietly beneath the surface, is now commanding attention with a powerful presale, explosive demand, and a confirmed LBank listing that could change the game overnight. The question is no longer whether BTC-S can make noise. It’s how loud that noise will be when the listing bell rings. Ethereum Holds Its Ground, But BTC-S Is Racing Ahead Ethereum has proven itself as a cornerstone of the Web3 world. With thousands of DApps, smart contracts, and Layer 2 integrations, it’s not going anywhere. Predictions showing a price near $2,712 in 2026 and $5,370 by 2040 give it long-term credibility. But that kind of climb requires patience. Bitcoin Solaris, on the other hand, is offering a different timeline altogether. It’s not built to follow the market’s rhythm. It’s built to skip ahead of it. With the LBank listing on the horizon, users are treating BTC-S not just as an investment, but as a chance to relive the early Bitcoin days, only faster. Introducing Bitcoin Solaris: Built to Go Beyond Bitcoin Solaris is not just another altcoin. It’s a dual-layer blockchain ecosystem engineered for scale, speed, and user empowerment. At the heart of BTC-S is a two-tiered structure that separates base-level consensus from high-speed application execution. The Base Layer operates on Proof-of-Work, securing the network with real computational effort. The Solaris Layer runs on Delegated Proof-of-Stake, offering blazing-fast transactions with 2-second finality. Combined, they deliver over 10,000 transactions per second and 99.95% less energy usage than traditional PoW chains. Smart contracts are built for DeFi, gaming, and cross-chain interoperability using Rust for added security. And through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app, users will mine BTC-S directly from their mobile devices, making the coin accessible and inclusive. The mining calculator shows just how much passive power lies in your pocket. Presale Momentum and the Unexpected Price Rollback The Bitcoin Solaris presale is in its 11th and final phase. Currently priced at $11, it’s scheduled to launch at $20 on July 31, making the potential return a clean 150 percent. Over 14,150 unique users have already joined, with more than $6.6 million raised. Not Just Scalable Designed to Be Unstoppable That’s BTC-S But here’s the twist: for a very limited time, Bitcoin Solaris has announced a Price rollback, temporarily reducing the entry price to $5. Not a bonus. Not a discount. A rollback. A strategic move that turns heads and rewards fast movers. Given the tech and momentum, it’s rare to see a project this strong offer one last low-price window. And to ensure seamless delivery on launch day, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended, not for buying, but for receiving your tokens after July 31. LBank Listing: A Catalyst Waiting to Detonate When a coin with this much hype hits a major exchange, movement happens. LBank brings BTC-S to a global audience, with high liquidity and massive visibility. Combined with the speed and energy efficiency BTC-S offers, this listing is set to serve as a rocket booster. That’s why many are calling it the “Bitcoin of 2025”, a rare second chance for those who missed the early BTC days. The infrastructure is ready. The roadmap is bold. And the price point is still within reach. Verified and Reviewed: What Experts Are Saying Crypto analysts aren’t the only ones buzzing. Influencers are lighting up YouTube with detailed breakdowns of BTC-S. A Crypto Show video calls Bitcoin Solaris “the most complete presale project of 2025,” highlighting its dual-consensus architecture. Token Galaxy breaks down the technical innovations that make BTC-S stand out even in a crowded launch year. On top of that, investors are reassured by two major smart contract audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins , both confirming the project’s security and robustness. Bitcoin Solaris Roadmap: From Launch to Global Impact BTC-S is not a one-hit wonder. The project roadmap reveals a long-term vision that includes: Testnet launch, wallet development, and exchange integration in early 2026 A full mainnet with governance features and partnerships by mid-2026 Hardware wallet integration, Layer 2 scaling, and enterprise adoption by 2027 Education, innovation labs, and global collaborations from 2028 onward This isn’t just a coin. It’s an evolving financial ecosystem with a clear execution plan. Final Verdict: Get In Before the Window Closes While Ethereum inches forward on its long-term curve, Bitcoin Solaris is racing to break the charts before the year ends. With a confirmed LBank listing, a powerful presale structure, and game-changing technology, BTC-S is delivering on every front. And with the Price rollback live for a short time, this may be the last moment BTC-S is available under $10 ever again.

2025-07-12T13:20:42,"Bitwise CIO Says Bitcoin Sellers Are Almost Exhausted, Doubles Down on $200,000 Bitcoin Price Target – Here’s His Timeline","Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer (CIO) of the digital asset management firm Bitwise, is predicting that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will go up by more than 70% from the current level. In a new interview on the White Crypto YouTube channel, Hougan says Bitcoin could reach a price “north of $200,000” by the end of this year. According to the Bitwise CIO, demand for the crypto king is currently outstripping supply. “If you look at the amount of Bitcoin on exchange, it’s at record multi-year lows. We think those sellers are almost exhausted. At the same time, we think the institutional demand from companies, governments, and [exchange-traded funds] ETFs is increasing. So you have available supply decreasing and institutional demand increasing and rising concerns about the fiat system. We think that is a recipe for a significant end-of-the-year rally. So, our prediction is above $200,000.” By 2030, Hougan says the total market cap of Bitcoin could reach parity with that of gold. “Gold keeps going up. So that number keeps going up. I think it was like $800,000 when we made that prediction and maybe it’s $1.2 million by now. But we think parity with gold is about where we should end this cycle, which we think stretches for the rest of the decade. There are things that could increase that, and there are things that could decrease that. But we think that’s a reasonable pattern matching from historical cyclical growth. And I know that’s a long way, but I think Bitcoin could do it.” Bitcoin is trading at $117,110 at time of writing.

2025-07-12T13:20:13,"U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Ignite Market with Over $1 Billion Inflow Surge","BitcoinWorld U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Ignite Market with Over $1 Billion Inflow Surge The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement! On July 11, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed an extraordinary milestone, raking in over $1.02 billion in total net inflows. This remarkable surge marks the seventh consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling a powerful wave of institutional interest and confidence in the leading digital asset. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market, this development is not just a number; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and appeal to mainstream investors. Understanding the Phenomenon of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs For years, direct investment in Bitcoin for traditional financial institutions and retail investors was often complex, involving navigating crypto exchanges, managing private keys, and dealing with regulatory uncertainties. The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs changed the game entirely. These exchange-traded funds allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Here’s why they are so pivotal: Accessibility: They make Bitcoin investment as simple as buying a stock through a traditional brokerage account. Regulatory Clarity: Operating under the purview of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), they offer a regulated and secure investment vehicle. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, providing high liquidity for buying and selling. Institutional Gateway: They serve as a crucial bridge, allowing large institutional investors, pension funds, and wealth managers to allocate capital to Bitcoin within their existing compliance frameworks. The consistent positive inflows are a clear indicator that this gateway is being utilized heavily, reflecting a broader shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows : Who’s Leading the Charge? The $1.02 billion net inflow on July 11 was not just a collective effort; it was dominated by a few key players, showcasing significant conviction from major asset managers. This day alone surpassed many previous daily records, highlighting an accelerating pace of adoption. Let’s break down the contributions from the top performers: ETF Ticker Asset Manager Net Inflow (July 11) IBIT BlackRock $951.54 million ARKB ARK Invest $23.51 million Mini BTC Grayscale $20.93 million HODL VanEck $20.01 million BITB Bitwise $6.41 million BTCO Invesco $5.30 million BlackRock’s IBIT, once again, demonstrated its formidable market presence, accounting for the vast majority of the day’s inflows. This consistent dominance by BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, sends a powerful message about the long-term viability and attractiveness of Bitcoin as an investment asset. The fact that this marks the seventh consecutive day of positive Bitcoin ETF Inflows underscores a sustained, rather than sporadic, interest from investors. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption on Market Dynamics The steady stream of capital flowing into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has profound implications for the entire crypto ecosystem. It’s not just about the price of Bitcoin; it’s about its fundamental position in the global financial landscape. Key impacts include: Price Stability and Growth: Increased demand from large, long-term institutional investors can contribute to greater price stability and upward pressure on Bitcoin’s value, potentially reducing its historical volatility. Legitimacy and Mainstream Acceptance: The embrace by major financial institutions lends significant credibility to Bitcoin, paving the way for broader public and corporate acceptance. Market Maturation: As more regulated products emerge, the crypto market begins to resemble traditional financial markets, attracting a wider range of participants and capital. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: As ETFs accumulate Bitcoin, they effectively remove supply from the open market, which can create scarcity and further upward price pressure if demand continues to rise. This Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is a critical step in Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital asset to a recognized store of value and a legitimate asset class alongside gold, real estate, and equities. Navigating Future Crypto Market Trends : What’s Next? The consistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are setting a precedent for future Crypto Market Trends . This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it represents a significant shift in investor sentiment and capital allocation. What should investors and enthusiasts watch for next? Continued ETF Performance: Monitor daily and weekly inflow data. Sustained positive flows will reinforce the bullish narrative. Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on global regulatory stances on cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Favorable regulations could unlock even more institutional capital. Broader Digital Asset ETFs: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for similar products for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, further broadening the market. Corporate Treasury Adoption: As institutional comfort grows, more corporations might consider holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, following in the footsteps of early adopters. Retail Investor Sentiment: While institutional flows are dominant, a sustained bullish trend could reignite retail interest, creating a powerful synergy of demand. The current momentum suggests a strong foundational shift, but market watchers should remain vigilant for any shifts in global economic conditions or regulatory headwinds that could impact these trends. Strategies for Digital Asset Investment in a Maturing Landscape For individual investors looking to participate in this evolving landscape, understanding the dynamics of Digital Asset Investment is crucial. The advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs offers a new avenue, but it’s important to consider your personal investment goals and risk tolerance. Consider these strategies: Diversification: While Bitcoin is leading the charge, a diversified portfolio across various digital assets and traditional investments can mitigate risk. Long-Term Horizon: Institutional adoption often implies a long-term investment horizon. Volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market, so patience is key. Research and Due Diligence: Understand the underlying technology, market dynamics, and regulatory environment of any digital asset or ETF you consider investing in. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For those investing directly in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, regular, smaller investments can help average out the purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term price swings. Leverage ETFs Wisely: If choosing Bitcoin ETFs, understand their fee structures, liquidity, and how they track Bitcoin’s price. They offer convenience but also come with their own set of considerations compared to direct ownership. The market is maturing, but it’s still a relatively new asset class. Informed decisions, based on thorough research, are paramount. In conclusion, the astounding $1.02 billion in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 11, marking seven consecutive days of positive movement, is a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency market. Led overwhelmingly by BlackRock’s IBIT, these figures underscore a powerful and accelerating trend of institutional adoption. This influx of traditional capital is not merely boosting Bitcoin’s price; it is fundamentally reshaping its perception, solidifying its role as a legitimate and increasingly indispensable asset in global finance. As these trends continue, we can expect a more stable, mature, and widely accepted digital asset ecosystem, truly ushering in a new era for Bitcoin and beyond.

Despite this significant surge, the market has witnessed no pressure from investors looking to lock in profits. The low pressure is evident in exchange inflows for both BTC and altcoins. Analysts at the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant said BTC, XRP, and ether (ETH) investors have been on the sidelines this week, despite their holdings seeing substantial profits. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Plummet According to CryptoQuant, total daily Bitcoin exchange inflows have fallen to 18,000 BTC, the lowest level since April 2015. This metric rose to 81,000 BTC in November 2024, when BTC first neared the $100,000 level. Large BTC holders are also sending fewer assets to crypto exchanges. The daily amount coming from this cohort of investors has plummeted from 62,000 BTC in November to 7,000 BTC currently. Less BTC flows from both large and small investors to exchanges, signaling less selling pressure, further implying that the market is not in overheating mode yet. Ether is witnessing similar exchange flows as BTC. The daily inflows for this asset have plunged to their lowest since October 2024. Investors are sending 584,000 ETH to exchanges today, compared to 1.57 million in February 2025. These low inflows coincide with ether’s 87% surge since early April. Low Pressure on Altcoins Additionally, XRP inflows to Binance have declined from the November spike of 10 billion XRP to 4 million XRP currently. At the time of the spike, there were several positive developments around the coin’s issuer, Ripple. Among them are the possible approval of the company’s stablecoin, RLUSD, and optimism surrounding an XRP-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). XRP had rallied at least 400% from $0.50 to $2.60 at the time, triggering a profit-taking frenzy among market participants. Currently, the opposite is the case. Even whales are on the sidelines following the coin’s rally above $2.90. Notably, XRP whale inflows have fallen 85% from 1.1 billion in February to 169 million today. CryptoQuant further revealed that the lack of selling pressure can be seen in the broader altcoin market as their exchange inflows have been muted. Daily inflows to exchanges usually spike following strong rallies as traders take profits. However, the figure has fallen to 21,000 from roughly 120,000 in March and December 2024.

Given BTC’s response to the initial such threats in April, the question now arises whether the asset’s recent resurgence and jump to uncharted territory will come to an end. BREAKING: President Trump announces 30% tariff on the European Union and Mexico. Trump says if they retaliate, these tariffs will be raised by the same amount as the retaliation. pic.twitter.com/JQ1HsLeseO — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 12, 2025 The letter sent to “Her Excellency” – EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, reads that it’s Trump’s “great honor” to demonstrate the strength and commitment of the two parties’ trading relationship, even though the US has “one of the largest trade deficits” with the Union. Consequently, the POTUS has described the 30% tariffs, which will go into effect on August 1, as a “more balanced and fair trade” that will allow the US to continue its relationship with the EU. At the same time, Trump’s letter reads that the EU will “allow complete, open market access to the United States, with no tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large trade deficit” and issue the following warning: “If for any reason you decide to raise your tarrifs and retaliate, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 30% that we charge.” The letter to the Mexican President, Dr. Claudia Pardo, carried a similar message and the same threat. Recent history from earlier this year shows that bitcoin’s price tends to be highly affected by tariffs imposed or even threatened by the US President against other countries. Back in April, as Trump was slapping tariffs against essentially every country, BTC tumbled from over $100,000 to under $75,000 to mark a five-month low . It has recovered a lot of ground since then, and it skyrocketed to a new all-time high earlier this week at over $119,000. It would be interesting to follow whether the latest set of tariffs will hinder its progress or will BTC rise above them. BTCUSD.

The second fastest ETF to achieve this level was Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which reached it in 1,814 days. On Friday, bitcoin set a new all-time high of $118,667. During interviews with CNBC and Yahoo Financ e, Bitwise Asset Management CIO said his firm expects the BTC price to reach over $200,000 by the end of this year. As for how high bitcoin could go, hedge fund manager James Lavish says that the bitcoin price is similar to the U.S. debt ceiling in that, ultimately, there is no limit. Technical Analysis Bitcoin displayed a consolidation pattern throughout the 23-hour timeframe from 11 July 11:00 to 12 July 10:00 UTC, operating within a comprehensive range of $1,633.46, representing 1% from the peak of $118,226.29 to the trough of $116,592.83, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The most significant price movements occurred during the initial hours, particularly around 13:00 and 15:00 UTC on 11 July, when elevated volume above the 24-hour average of 7,291 accompanied pronounced intraday swings, forming key support near $116,726.00 and resistance around $118,226.00. Following this early turbulence, BTC demonstrated exceptional stability with decreasing volume, consolidating mainly between $117,400.00-$117,900.00, before exhibiting renewed strength in the final hours with a recovery toward $118,025.00, suggesting potential bullish momentum developing for the subsequent trading session. Throughout the final 60 minutes from July 12 09:57 to 10:56 UTC, Bitcoin encountered heightened volatility with a notable downward movement from $118,121.16 to a low of $117,835.74 at 10:14, followed by a strong rebound that established the $118,000.00-$118,070.00 range as a new consolidation zone. The period displayed classic support and resistance dynamics, with volume spikes of 392.48 and 382.49 during the 10:12-10:14 selloff confirming institutional participation, while the subsequent recovery above $118,035.00 on diminishing volume suggests underlying strength and potential for continued upward momentum.

2025-07-12T13:00:58,"OpenAI’s Crucial AI Model Release Faces Unexpected Delay","BitcoinWorld OpenAI’s Crucial AI Model Release Faces Unexpected Delay In the rapidly evolving world where artificial intelligence increasingly intersects with blockchain and digital assets, news from tech giants like OpenAI sends ripples across the entire innovation landscape. For those tracking the pulse of technological advancements, the latest announcement from OpenAI regarding its highly anticipated AI model release is a significant development, raising questions about the balance between innovation speed and responsible deployment. Understanding OpenAI’s Latest Delay: Sam Altman’s Commitment to Safety For the second time this summer, OpenAI has announced a delay in the release of its groundbreaking open AI model . Originally slated for next week, the launch has been pushed back indefinitely. Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , confirmed the decision, citing the critical need for additional safety testing and thorough review of high-risk areas. In a post on X, Altman emphasized, “We need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. We are not yet sure how long it will take us.” This cautious approach highlights the company’s commitment to ensuring the model’s integrity before it becomes widely accessible. Altman added, “While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back. This is new for us and we want to get it right.” Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Capability wise, we think the model is phenomenal — but our bar for an open source model is high and we think we need some more time to make sure we’re releasing a model we’re proud of along every axis.” What Makes This OpenAI AI Model So Anticipated? The delayed open AI model from OpenAI is one of the most keenly awaited events in the AI community this summer, alongside the expected release of GPT-5 . This new open model is anticipated to possess reasoning capabilities similar to OpenAI ‘s ‘o-series’ of models, promising a significant leap forward in accessible AI technology. Bitcoin World previously reported that OpenAI leaders have even discussed enabling this open AI model to connect to the company’s cloud-hosted AI models for complex queries, though it remains uncertain if these advanced features will be included in the final release. The expectation is that this model will set a new benchmark, becoming best-in-class compared to other open models currently available. Its release could empower developers with unprecedented tools, fostering innovation across countless applications. Navigating the Intense AI Competition Landscape The decision to delay comes at a time of escalating AI competition within Silicon Valley. OpenAI is striving to maintain its leadership position against formidable contenders like xAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, all of whom are investing billions into their own AI initiatives. The competitive landscape became even more dynamic recently with the launch of Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2, a one trillion parameter open AI model that has demonstrated superior performance over OpenAI ’s GPT-4.1 AI model on several agentic-coding benchmarks. This intensified rivalry underscores the pressure on OpenAI to not only innovate but also to ensure the robustness and safety of its products before public release. The delay, while frustrating for developers, might be a strategic move to ensure the model is truly groundbreaking and secure, safeguarding OpenAI ‘s reputation and competitive edge. The Broader Implications for the AI Ecosystem The indefinite postponement of OpenAI ‘s open AI model has broader implications for the entire AI ecosystem . Developers eager to integrate OpenAI ‘s latest capabilities into their projects will have to wait, potentially slowing down certain innovation cycles. However, this delay also highlights a growing industry trend: prioritizing safety and ethical considerations over rapid deployment. In a world where AI’s power is rapidly expanding, the responsible development of these technologies is paramount. The challenges of ensuring an AI model’s safety, especially one whose weights cannot be recalled once released, are immense. This cautious approach by OpenAI could set a precedent for the industry, encouraging other developers to adopt similar rigorous testing protocols. While the wait is extended, the commitment to a safer, more reliable AI model could ultimately benefit the community in the long run. What’s Next for OpenAI and the AI World? The delay of OpenAI ‘s open AI model is a stark reminder of the complexities and responsibilities inherent in developing advanced artificial intelligence. While the anticipation for this model, and for GPT-5 , remains high, Sam Altman ‘s emphasis on safety underscores a mature approach to innovation. The coming months will be crucial for OpenAI as it navigates the final stages of development, aiming to deliver a model that is not only powerful but also impeccably safe and reliable. The broader AI ecosystem will undoubtedly watch closely, as OpenAI ‘s decisions continue to shape the future trajectory of AI development and its impact on technology and society.

Bullish Bets Rise as HYPE Enters Price Discovery Phase","HYPE price surged to a new all-time high, thus potentially entering its parabolic phase of the 2025 bull rally. The Hyperliquid platform has grown to a vital DEX focused on perpetual futures trading with over $10 billion in Open Interest. The majority of Polymarket traders doubt whether HYPE could reach $100 by the end of 2025. Hyperliquid (HYPE) surged to a new all-time high (ATH) of $46.74 in the past 24 hours, entering its price discovery phase during the ongoing 2025 crypto bull market The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $46.7 billion, surged 2.2% in value, following Bitcoin’s breakout to $118K. Following the update, the Polymarket shows a 19% chance that HYPE will hit $100 by the end of 2025. However, while the odds for HYPE to hit $100K remains modest, a majority of bets show investors rooting for the price to hit $50 in 2025, with an imminent listing on Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN). Furthermore, the DEX, which focuses on perpetual futures trading, has pushed HYPE to the 12th largest digital asset by market cap in less than a year.

2025-07-12T12:57:21,"Investors have committed $16 million to Bitcoin futures, Bank of Russia report","Russian investors have bought Bitcoin futures worth more than $16 million in less than a month of trading, according to stats released by the Central Bank of Russia. Private individuals account for the majority of purchases, the monetary authority noted, reminding Russian citizens that crypto derivatives carry similar risks to their underlying assets. CBR gauges Russia’s new Bitcoin futures market The Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) has published statistical data revealing the size of the country’s young market for futures based on cryptocurrency prices. It added those numbers to the latest edition of its “Overview of Financial Market Risks.” As of June 27, the total volume of open net positions of retail investors was approximately 1.25 billion rubles (over $16 million), the document unveiled. “The share of individuals in the total volume of long positions is 97%,” the regulator highlighted. The trading of futures linked to the value of the leading cryptocurrency started on June 4 in Russia, when the Moscow Exchange launched contracts on the shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) expiring in September. That became possible in late May when the CBR allowed financial institutions to offer crypto derivatives to qualified investors while warning both financial firms and their clients in Russia against direct investments in digital assets. This week, it took the opportunity to reiterate its concerns. “It’s worth noting that these instruments carry increased risks for investors,” the monetary authority stated, emphasizing: “Cryptocurrencies are volatile and risky, therefore, investments in instruments whose pricing depends on them will also have such characteristics.” The most common positions, open by the majority of investors (2,800), are under 500,000 rubles (below $6,500), the report detailed. At the same time, private investors controlling larger capital, with portfolios exceeding 100 million rubles, account for a significant portion of the invested funds, the central bank noticed. These are followed by other big players with capital ranging between 10 million to 50 million rubles. “However, it is worth noting that the number of investors in these cohorts is relatively small, the Bank of Russia commented. It also remarked: “The opposite short position is mainly occupied by non-resident legal entities.” Crypto derivatives still out of reach for ordinary Russians While recent reports have revealed that Russians hold over $25 billion worth of crypto assets, financial regulators in the country, including the central bank and the finance ministry, remain opposed to giving ordinary citizens access to cryptocurrencies or crypto derivatives. In March this year, the CBR suggested to allow a limited number of investors to acquire and trade digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) within the framework of an “experimental legal regime” (ELR). The bank said these should be “highly qualified investors” only. To fall in that category, which is yet to be legally defined, private individuals would need to prove annual income of 50 million rubles (over $600,000) or more and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles ($1.2 million), the authority proposed. Meanwhile, a new study, the results of which were published by the business daily Vedomosti this week, showed that 52% of Russia’s qualified investors already have crypto in their wallets. And another 38%, who haven’t bought yet, intend to do so in the future, bringing the total of those interested in crypto investments to 90% of the respondents. The Central Bank of Russia, however, remains stubborn in its stance against Bitcoin. Its governor, Elvira Nabiullina, recently insisted the monetary policy regulator has no current plans to add cryptocurrencies to its reserves. The CBR also rejects any possibility of permitting the use of digital coins such as BTC for payments within its territory, outside the ELR. The special regime allows Russian companies to employ BTC and other coins in international settlements with trading partners amid financial restrictions imposed with war-related sanctions on Moscow.
