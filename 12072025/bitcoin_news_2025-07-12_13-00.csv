2025-07-12T10:53:19,"Crypto Analyst: Altcoins Rally Strongly While Bitcoin Dominance Remains Unshaken","Despite Bitcoin maintaining a steady grip on the market, many altcoins are experiencing significant price surges, suggesting ample room for further upside in the broader crypto market. Key Takeaways: Altcoins are rallying strongly alongside Bitcoin, despite Bitcoin’s dominance at 64%. The usual signal for an altseason, a drop in Bitcoin dominance, is absent. However, analysts indicate the altcoin season is underway. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland noted on X that “BTC dominance hasn’t even sneezed and Alts are ripping,” highlighting the recent momentum in altcoins alongside Bitcoin’s steady dominance. At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 64.46%, down just 1.53% over the past week, even as Bitcoin climbed to new all-time highs — reaching $118,760 on Friday. Declining Bitcoin Dominance Typically Signals Start of Altseason Traditionally, a decline in Bitcoin dominance signals the start of an “altseason,” where altcoins gain market share. However, the current surge in altcoins without a significant drop in Bitcoin dominance may indicate fresh capital flowing into the entire crypto ecosystem rather than a shift away from Bitcoin. Among the top performers over the past week, MemeCore (M) led with a staggering 1,263% rally, followed by Mog Coin (MOG) up 75% and Stellar (XLM) rising 67%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, increased by 17.68% over the same period, with the ETH/BTC ratio climbing 8.39%, reinforcing traders’ expectations of a growing focus on altcoins. However, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index still reads “Bitcoin Season,” with a score of 29 out of 100, indicating that Bitcoin remains the dominant market driver. Yet, traders like Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, believe the market is approaching the “final easy and biggest bull ever on Altcoins.” “Trading Altcoins is difficult, that’s why the downwards corrections are extremely challenging and the upwards returns enormous,” he said. Cases like $OMNI are basically the reason why I tend to be into positions early. Especially if I'm willing to go full risk-on (I assume that we're about to witness the final easy and biggest bull ever on #Altcoins ), then I'd rather want to be early than buying after such a move.… — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 11, 2025 Data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment also supports this view, confirming that altcoin season has started. Santiment added that as long as Bitcoin holds above key psychological support near $110,000, traders will likely continue reallocating profits into altcoins, fueling further growth in the broader crypto market. Bitcoin Surpasses Silver in Market Cap Bitcoin’s market capitalization has surged past silver’s, reaching $2.34 trillion after the cryptocurrency hit a fresh all-time high above $118,000. The milestone places Bitcoin sixth among the world’s largest assets , surpassing silver’s $2.16 trillion market cap, according to Companies Market Cap data. Bitcoin is closing in on the top five assets, with Amazon’s $2.37 trillion market cap now within reach. Behind Bitcoin and silver are tech giants Google and Meta, valued at $1.15 trillion and $1.79 trillion, respectively. However, gold remains the dominant asset with a massive $22.6 trillion market cap. NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple follow, holding market caps in the $3 to $4 trillion range, well ahead of Bitcoin for now. Institutional demand has been a key driver, supporting Bitcoin’s consolidation above $100,000 before its recent price surge. Mercuryo CEO Petr Kozyakov noted that institutional interest continues to push Bitcoin’s value higher, underscoring its rising appeal as a store of value alongside altcoins like Ethereum, which recently surpassed $3,000.

2025-07-12T10:30:45,"Bitcoin Dominance Continues Historic Climb – Altcoins Struggle To Gain Ground","Bitcoin has officially entered a new chapter in its bull market, surging to fresh all-time highs near $118,800 after weeks of tight consolidation. This decisive breakout marks a pivotal shift in momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential explosive leg higher as bullish sentiment returns. The move above previous highs has not only reignited interest in BTC but also fueled optimism across the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 – Price Magnet Forming One of the most telling indicators of the current cycle’s strength is Bitcoin Dominance. According to top analyst On-Chain Mind, BTC dominance has climbed to 65% since the beginning of this bull market. This sharp increase highlights a clear preference among investors for Bitcoin over altcoins, solidifying its position as the market’s anchor in times of volatility and growth. As Bitcoin leads the charge, market watchers believe the breakout could trigger a wave of institutional inflows and renewed attention from sidelined retail investors. With momentum building and confidence growing, the breakout above $118K may just be the start of an even larger move, one that could define the next phase of the 2025 crypto bull cycle. Bitcoin Leads The Charge After weeks of sideways consolidation below the $110,000 mark, Bitcoin has finally broken out, launching a new bullish phase and pushing the broader crypto market into motion. Altcoins, which had lagged in recent months, are now climbing above key resistance levels as confidence spreads. This coordinated move comes amid a backdrop of macroeconomic shifts, with market participants increasingly anticipating a weakening US dollar and the return of inflationary policies under US President Donald Trump’s administration. With expectations of rate cuts looming and pressure mounting on the Federal Reserve, the market sees crypto—especially Bitcoin—as a natural hedge. However, caution still lingers. US Treasury yields remain elevated, continuing to flash warnings of systemic stress in the traditional financial system. That tension has only strengthened Bitcoin’s appeal as a non-sovereign, hard-capped monetary asset. Bitcoin dominance tells the story clearly. “At the start of this bull market, it sat at 40%. Today? 65%,” noted On-Chain Mind, emphasizing how investor preference has overwhelmingly leaned toward BTC. This dominance reflects a trend that has barely flinched, even as Ethereum and other altcoins attempt to catch up. As BTC leads the market higher, its dominance reinforces its role as the primary beneficiary of macro uncertainty. While the altcoin space is beginning to show signs of life, it’s clear that Bitcoin remains the anchor, and investors aren’t ready to rotate just yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Oscillator Predicts First Sell Pressure Level At $130,900 – Details 4‑Hour Chart: Post‑Breakout Cooling Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart shows a clean breakout followed by consolidation, a typical sign of strength after an impulsive move. Price surged from the long-standing resistance at $109,300 to a local high of $118,000 in less than twelve hours, marking an 8% rally. This breakout flipped prior resistance into support and triggered strong volume, validating the move. Volume has decreased during this period, which is characteristic of a bullish consolidation rather than distribution. The 50-period moving average (blue) has crossed above the 100-period (green), forming a short-term golden cross near $109K. This crossover supports a bullish outlook, with the 200-period moving average (red) trending upward from $105K, reinforcing the structure of higher lows. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level – Relief Or Reversal? As long as Bitcoin remains above $112K, bulls are firmly in control.

2025-07-12T10:30:41,"Think Before You Tap: Tasmania’s Crypto ATM Craze Turns Into $1.6M Scam Disaster","Tasmania’s law enforcement agencies are intensifying their scrutiny of cryptocurrency ATMs following the discovery that the most active users in the region have been victims of fraudulent schemes. According to a new announcement from Tasmania Police Cyber Investigations, the top 15 users of crypto ATMs across the state have all fallen prey to scams, resulting in a combined loss of approximately 2.5 million Australian dollars (USD $1.6 million). Notably, around $592,000 of this total was funneled through crypto ATMs. The findings are part of a broader national enforcement initiative aimed at curbing the misuse of cryptocurrency kiosks across Australia. Scammers Direct Victims to Crypto ATMs After Banks Flag Suspicious Activity The operation is being spearheaded by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in collaboration with AUSTRAC, the nation’s financial intelligence unit. Tasmania’s involvement highlights how local jurisdictions are aligning with federal efforts to tighten oversight of crypto-related activities, particularly in response to the rising use of ATMs for illicit transactions. Detective Sergeant Paul Turner of the Tasmania Police stated that in many cases, victims had originally attempted to send funds through traditional banking channels. When banks flagged and blocked those transfers due to suspicious activity, scammers redirected the victims to use cryptocurrency ATMs as an alternative. This move bypassed traditional financial safeguards and allowed fraudulent transactions to proceed. Turner emphasized that the scams frequently involve high-stakes financial manipulation, often masquerading as investment opportunities or romantic connections. “Victims are being manipulated, intimidated, and pressured into investing in fake investment and romance scams,” he said. The repercussions can be severe, with many individuals reportedly forced to delay retirement, sell personal assets, or rely on social support systems due to the financial impact. Turner advised the public to be wary of anyone instructing them to use a digital currency ATM, especially if the request is urgent or comes from someone they have never met in person. ATM Expansion and New Compliance Measures Reflect Growing Risks The number of crypto ATMs in Tasmania has risen sharply in recent years, from just one machine in 2021 to over 20 by mid-2025. Data from Coin ATM Radar confirms there are currently 24 operational crypto ATMs in the state. Nationally, Australia is now the third-largest country in terms of crypto ATM installations , trailing only the United States and Canada. The total number of machines across the country has grown from just 67 in August 2022 to over 1,890 today. In response to mounting concerns, AUSTRAC implemented updated operational rules and new transaction limits for digital currency ATM operators starting June 3. The agency has also designated cryptocurrency-related activity as a regulatory priority heading into 2025. Major ATM providers in the country include Localcoin with 807 units, Coinflip with 691, and Bitcoin Depot with 212, reflecting the scale and accessibility of these machines for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes.

2025-07-12T10:27:17,"XRP Price Prediction: Investors on High Alert for July 14, 21, 25 – What’s Next for XRP?","XRP price has broken $2.80 as optimism around ETFs grows. The market is watching three key dates, July 14, 21, and 25, which could open up institutional access to XRP. The coin is up 7% in the last 24 hours on ETF speculation and broader crypto strength. It all started when ProShares announced they would be launching three XRP futures ETFs—Ultra XRP, UltraShort XRP, and Short XRP—on July 14. These products will allow both bulls and bears to get leveraged exposure to Ripple. ""XRP ETF Race Heats Up: Why July 14, July 21, And July 25 Are Important"" #Ethereum #Bitcoin #XRP #Solana #Ondo #Cronos #Binance #Picoin #Cardano #Litecoin #Finance #CryptoNews https://t.co/fdPxpHYKk3 — The Crypto Radar NewStand (@JONDONI_CRYPTO) July 12, 2025 ProShares had delayed these in April, but the SEC’s acknowledgement of the filings has brought back investor confidence. If approved, these funds will allow institutions to hedge or speculate on XRP more efficiently. ETF Launch Date: July 14 (ProShares Futures ETFs) Product Types: Long & Short Leverage Market Impact: Higher liquidity, more institutional activity The futures strategy could also be a stepping stone for spot ETFs, similar to Bitcoin’s regulatory path in the US. Leveraged Products on July 21 Momentum could accelerate on July 21 when Volatility Shares and Tuttle Capital launch 2X leveraged XRP ETFs. These products amplify daily returns—perfect for active traders looking to trade Ripple volatility. JUST IN: ProShares XRP ETF set to begin trading July 18, 2025. Documented. pic.twitter.com/7sUmG8i2oy — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 11, 2025 Both have completed regulatory steps, so there is a high probability of launch. If these ETFs go live, it will be the first time XRP has had multiple leveraged products in the US, which could increase volume and short-term price action. ETF Launch Date: July 21 Providers: Volatility Shares, Tuttle Capital Product: 2X Leveraged Long XRP ETFs Implication: More trading volume, volatility-driven opportunities These products will attract momentum traders and algorithmic funds that previously avoided XRP due to regulatory uncertainty. Spot XRP ETF Decision on July 25 The biggest news comes on July 25, when the SEC is expected to rule on the REX-Osprey Spot XRP ETF. Unlike futures ETFs, this will hold XRP directly, providing institutions with a regulated way to gain exposure without owning the asset itself. With court decisions going in Ripple’s favor and pressure mounting on the SEC to modernize its crypto approach, analysts think approval is getting more likely. If approved, this would not only be a green light but could open the door for other issuers like Bitwise and 21Shares to follow. Decision Date: July 25 ETF Type: Spot XRP ETF Issuer: REX Shares / Osprey Market Outlook: Institutional FOMO, new highs A spot ETF approval could be the catalyst, unlocking billions in capital and solidifying XRP’s top 10 status. XRP Chart Outlook: Overbought but Bullish From a technical standpoint, XRP price prediction continues to stay bullish as it is consolidating at $2.81 after a parabolic move above a rising channel. The price cleared the $2.695 resistance zone, which is now support. XPR/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, a Shooting Star on the 4-hour chart suggests possible exhaustion, particularly given the RSI’s position above 79, which is profound in overbought territory. Trade Setup: Buy Zone: $2.695–$2.62 (on dip) Stop Loss: $2.48 Targets: $2.97 short term, $3.14–$3.31 next resistance Watch for: Bullish engulfing or hammer candle Volume is tapering off, so patience is required. A dip would be a better entry. With ETFs dominating the July narrative, XRP could be entering a significant chapter. Now it’s all eyes on the regulators, and if approvals align, XRP may retest all-time highs.

2025-07-12T10:00:00,"Bitcoin’s all-time high fuels $1B in liquidations as ETH, XRP, MOG soar double digits","After being stuck in a month-long consolidation range between $100,000 and $110,000, Bitcoin broke out and set multiple all-time highs during the week. The total crypto market capitalisation climbed 10.88% over the week to $3.77 trillion, revisiting levels last seen in January. Market sentiment continued to strengthen, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising to 71. However, it remained below the June peak, indicating room for further upside. With risk sentiment replenished, altcoins closed the week in profit, as the rally extended across the broader market. Why is Bitcoin price increasing? Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $118,667 as of late Asian trading hours on Friday after rallying more than 10% over the past seven days. The breakout triggered one of the most severe short squeezes in recent years, wiping out over $1 billion in short positions within 24 hours, the largest daily liquidation event since 2021. According to CoinGlass, more than 232,000 traders were liquidated, with Bitcoin shorts accounting for over $570 million. The squeeze was amplified by high leverage and aggressive positioning around key resistance levels. Many high-leverage short positions were forced to close as Bitcoin surged through technical thresholds, further fuelling upward momentum. Rising institutional demand has also underpinned Bitcoin’s uptrend. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, launched earlier this year, continue to see steady inflows, with total net additions crossing $51 billion. On Thursday, the market recorded its second-largest daily inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs since launch, totalling $1.17 billion. Bitcoin’s breakout past $113,800 acted as a catalyst, driving inflows and sustaining bullish sentiment into Friday. Momentum has also been buoyed by growing optimism around the macroeconomic outlook. Traders are pricing in interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, with expectations that easing could begin as early as September. Fed officials like Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman have recently hinted at short-term rate cuts. Markets also anticipate accelerated cuts in 2026, should Donald Trump nominate a more dovish Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell. Historically, Bitcoin has benefited from looser monetary policy and low interest rates, which drive risk-on sentiment across asset classes. Meanwhile, crypto investors are closely watching political developments in Washington ahead of the “Crypto Week.” Lawmakers are scheduled to review three major bills in the coming week, including the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, the CLARITY Act to define regulatory roles between the SEC and CFTC, and a proposed ban on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). There’s also renewed speculation that China could ease its stance on digital assets. If that happens, such a move could unlock significant retail demand from Chinese investors. How high can Bitcoin go? With Bitcoin now in price discovery, market participants are eyeing higher targets ranging from $120,000 to as high as $250,000 over the coming months. The breakout above $113,800 has opened the door to a potential extension of the rally, especially as technical and macroeconomic conditions continue to align. In a July 10 media note, 10x Research head Markus Thielen estimated a 60% probability that Bitcoin could climb more than 20% in the next two months. This would put BTC above $140,000 by September if the uptrend holds. Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead echoed a similarly bullish outlook, projecting a $150,000 target based on ongoing ETF inflows, macro tailwinds, and expanding institutional adoption. Some analysts are even more optimistic. Pseudonymous trader Shibo, for instance, shared a fractal comparison of the 2020–2021 and 2024–2025 cycles, suggesting that Bitcoin’s current structure mirrors the early stages of its last major bull run. BTC/USD historical price trends. Source: Shibo. If the pattern plays out similarly, Shibo sees a $250,000 target as “programmed” over the next six months. A separate report by Keyrock outlined a potential path to $160,000 by year-end, provided corporate treasuries continue holding Bitcoin and macro conditions remain stable. However, the firm noted that it views $135,000 as a more probable year-end baseline but does not rule out a push toward the upper bound if risk sentiment persists. Others, however, are more cautious in the short term. CryptoOrca, who previously identified $120,000 as a key round-number resistance, now anticipates a short-term cooldown. (See below.) CryptOrca @CryptOrca · Follow $BTC $120k then retest for a support level wouldnt be bad 7:43 PM · Jul 11, 2025 11 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter According to the analyst, a pullback and retest of support around $113,000 would be healthy for the structure of the rally before any further upside. Looking at the Binance BTC/USDT 24-hour Liquidation Heatmap, the current market structure appears to support CryptoOrca’s view of a short-term cooldown. Binance BTC/USDT 24-hour Liquidation Heatmap. The heatmap reveals a concentration of liquidation clusters and leverage pockets between $111,000 and $113,000, indicating a strong zone of prior long interest and potential support. If Bitcoin experiences a pullback, this area is likely to act as a critical floor for the ongoing uptrend. The presence of dense yellow and green bands in this range suggests that many leveraged long positions were opened here. As a result, bulls will be incentivised to defend this level aggressively. A retest of this zone would not only reset overheated indicators but could also serve as a springboard for the next leg higher, potentially validating it as a new support base after the $100,000–$110,000 breakout. On the upside, the heatmap shows thinning liquidation density above the $118,000 mark, implying fewer short liquidations left to fuel a continued squeeze in the immediate term. This lack of short-side pressure could cap Bitcoin’s short-term upside around the psychological $120,000 level. Still, the long-term picture remains firmly bullish. As long as Bitcoin holds above the $111,000–$113,000 support band, momentum is expected to favour the further upside. Traders may look for high-conviction re-entry zones within this range before positioning for the next breakout phase. At press time, Bitcoin had some of its daily gains and was hovering around the $117,000 mark. Altcoin recap In the last 7 days, the altcoin market rose over 23% to reclaim the $1.52 trillion level, which it has not seen since early March. Analysts like Arthur Hayes think altcoin season could be on the horizon. Utility-focused cryptocurrencies such as Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), and Chainlink (LINK), all seen as strong ETF contenders, are expected to do well. But meme coins could end up gaining the most, just like they did in past bull runs. As of press time, Ethereum (ETH) was up 18% over the weekly period while XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and SUI (SUI) clocked gains ranging between 20-30%. MemeCore (M) was the highest gainer among the top 100 altcoins this week, soaring over 1,200% and pushing its market cap from $8 million to $1.36 billion at the time of writing. Mog Coin (MOG) and Story (IP), while not posting such explosive gains, also performed strongly with weekly increases of 82% and 45%, respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap MemeCore : MemeCore’s late-week rally was supported by a series of exchange listings, including Binance Alpha, Kraken, Bitget, BingX, HTX, and HashKey. Listings of this scale often trigger sharp moves for low-cap, newly launched tokens, a trend seen in previous bull cycles. MemeCore’s rally was further supported by a strategic partnership with market maker Klein Labs and a broader surge in market risk appetite following Bitcoin’s breakout to a new all-time high. Mog Coin : MOG’s price surged over the past week after it broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern, a chart setup in technical analysis that often signals a sharp move once the price escapes the narrowing range. The breakout drew in more investors who jumped in expecting further gains. The rally also benefited from the broader market recovery fuelled by Bitcoin’s new all-time highs, which reignited interest in the meme coin sector.

Upexi set to raise $200 million to purchase SOL According to its statement, Upexi mentioned that the $150 million convertible note offering would be collateralized via locked, spot SOL provided by the purchasers of its convertible notes, which is expected to have a two-year maturity and a 2% interest rate that is payable every quarter. After the completion of the note offering, the tokens are expected to be added to the SOL treasury maintained by the company. The firm had previously announced its intention to build a digital assets treasury filled with Solana in April, raising $100 million to back its purchase at the time. The company said about 95% of the raised funds would be used to set up, fill, and operate its Solana-based treasury reserve, marking its diversification into the crypto space. Following the announcement, Upexi shares skyrocketed, finishing the day at $9.89, up by 335%. The share previously rose as high as 22%, marking its highest price in a year. With its latest purchase, Upexi will push its treasury balance to 1.65 million SOL worth around $270 million. With the firm holding such an amount of tokens, it now boasts twice the amount of Solana as another prominent, publicly traded Solana treasury, DeFi Development Corporation (DFDV). Shares of Upexi are yet to react as much as they did when the news of the first raise broke, with the stock only seeing a 7.8% rise to hit $5.39 after the announcement was made. The stock, UPXI, is down about 58% in the last month after its first jump, which saw it peak at $22.57, according to data from Google Finance. Nevertheless, the shares are still up by 53% year-to-date. Solana is also on the rise, with the asset trading at $162.47, a drop of 0.92% in the past day. SOL experienced a price rise on Friday, with Bitcoin also hitting a new all-time high at the same time. Meanwhile, Grayscale has called out the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for pausing the debut of its exchange-traded funds that hold several assets including Solana. The company alleged that its investors are suffering harm as a result of the SEC’s decision. The company asked the SEC to allow its Digital Large Cap Fund to begin trading.

2025-07-12T09:57:15,"Crypto Bull Run Gains Momentum, Here’s When Altcoin Season Might Start","The post Crypto Bull Run Gains Momentum, Here’s When Altcoin Season Might Start appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has officially broken past the $118,000 mark, hitting a new all-time high. Crypto analyst Virtual Bacon believes this is the beginning of a major bull cycle. However, he warns that altseason has not yet arrived. Here’s what’s happening, what to watch for, and why investors should stay patient. Bitcoin Bull Run Over the last seven days, Bitcoin has climbed 8.8%. So far this month, the price has jumped nearly 10%, touching a new all-time high of $118,000 . Virtual Bacon considers this breakout a major bullish signal and believes it marks the start of a new bull market. He points out that Bitcoin typically leads during early bull phases, with altcoins following once liquidity shifts. “Bitcoin’s breakout confirms the beginning of a new cycle,” he wrote on X . Bitcoin’s current support levels: 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA): $86,982 20-week SMA: $96,719 (a proven dip-buying zone) Altcoin Season Is Close, But Not Confirmed Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.58%, down from 65.50% on July 1. While this slight drop is a good sign, altseason typically begins after a sustained fall in BTC dominance. Virtual Bacon points out early indicators: E thereum’ s price against BTC has jumped 10.53% this month ETH/BTC now trades at 0.02516, up from 0.02276 A strong weekly close above 0.024 could signal a true breakout From July 5 to 10, ETH/BTC surged by 9.49%, although it saw a minor correction of 1.08% afterward. The strength in ETH and SOL is encouraging, but not yet a confirmation of full altcoin rotation. Fed Quietly Injecting Liquidity into Markets A major factor supporting the crypto rally is the Federal Reserve’s quiet liquidity injection. Virtual Bacon outlines two major moves: $11 billion repo injection on June 30 A proposal to reduce the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) for large banks. These actions boost bank reserves and allow for more lending, which increases liquidity in the broader financial system. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : BitcoinTalk User Turns $500 to $10M After Unlocking 2012 Bitcoin Bar , Additionally, the Global Liquidity Index is making a higher low. If it breaks above its April and September 2024 highs, it could confirm expanding liquidity—another condition needed for altseason. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 17. Reports suggest there is a 64% chance of a rate cut in Q4 2025, which could further fuel crypto momentum. Final Thoughts: Wait for Confirmation Before Diving Into Altcoins While Bitcoin’s breakout is undeniable and the early signs for altcoins are positive, Virtual Bacon advises caution. A confirmed altseason requires: Sustained BTC dominance drop Breakout in ETH/BTC Full expansion in global liquidity Investors are advised to avoid jumping into low-cap altcoins prematurely. Instead, focus on large-cap coins showing early strength and wait for more macro confirmation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As of press time on July 12, XRP’s market capitalization stood at $163.98 billion, up from $131.41 billion a week earlier, an increase of about $32.57 billion. Notably, XRP peaked at $171.88 billion on July 11. XRP one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap This momentum has also lifted XRP’s price, which is now testing the $3 resistance zone. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $2.77, up nearly 25% over the last seven days and more than 7% on the daily chart. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Why XRP is rallying XRP’s rally has been fueled by its ability to track broader market sentiment, which has seen Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high above $118,000. Technically, XRP’s break above the $2.30 resistance level helped unlock further capital inflows. At the same time, on-chain data from analytics platform Santiment shared on July 11 shows that with XRP approaching $3, market interest has picked up notably. For example, 6,939 new XRP wallets were created in a single day, the highest daily figure since March 1. Additionally, social media activity has also spiked, with XRP now featuring in over 5.5% of all cryptocurrency-related discussions, a level last seen on March 18. XRP network activity chart. Source: Santiment XRP fundamentals Beyond technical drivers, institutional developments have buoyed sentiment. For instance, Ripple’s stablecoin , RLUSD, is seeing increased adoption in cross-border remittances, highlighted by Visa’s partnership with Yellow Card to facilitate settlements in Africa. In addition, XRP’s momentum has been supported by growing anticipation of a potential resolution in the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), with signs the two parties are moving closer to a settlement. Speculation around the possible approval of an XRP spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) has further fueled interest, as institutional investors eye the asset’s potential.

2025-07-12T09:35:17,"Top Crypto Tax-Free Countries in 2025","The post Top Crypto Tax-Free Countries in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto adoption has surged in 2025, but taxes remain a major concern for traders and investors. While most countries now impose strict regulations and high tax rates, a few nations still offer zero-tax regimes, making them global hubs for crypto startups, traders, and digital nomads. Here’s a look at the top crypto tax-free countries in 2025 and the worst countries to trade crypto if you want to hold on to your profits. Best Tax-Free Crypto Countries in 2025 Country Crypto Tax Rate / Status Cayman Islands 0% (No income, capital gains, or corporate tax) United Arab Emirates 0% (Tax-free on trading, staking, mining) El Salvador 0% (No capital gains or income tax on Bitcoin) Germany 0% (If held for over 12 months) Singapore 0% (Capital gains tax exempt) Malaysia 0% (Occasional trading only) Bermuda 0% (No income or capital gains tax) Belarus 0% (No income or capital gains tax) Malta 0% (Long-term gains only; corporate tax may apply) Cayman Islands The Cayman Islands is widely considered a crypto tax haven. There are no personal income taxes, capital gains taxes, or corporate taxes . This makes it ideal for long-term crypto holders, DeFi investors, and crypto businesses. United Arab Emirates The UAE has emerged as a top crypto-friendly country. Crypto trading, staking, mining, and NFT transactions are all tax-free . Although tax policies can vary across emirates, the overall regulatory environment is clear and pro-crypto. El Salvador Under its Digital Assets Law, El Salvador imposes zero capital gains and income tax on Bitcoin transactions . The government-backed Chivo wallet and the planned “Bitcoin City” add to its appeal for crypto investors and miners. Germany While not fully tax-free, Germany allows tax-free crypto sales after a 12-month holding period . If you hold Bitcoin or other digital assets for a year or more, you pay no tax when you sell, swap, or spend them. Singapore Singapore has no capital gains tax, making crypto trading and selling tax-free for most investors. However, if you earn crypto as payment for goods or services, it may be subject to income tax. Malaysia Malaysia does not impose capital gains tax, so occasional crypto trading is tax-free . However, frequent traders may be treated as professionals and taxed under income tax laws. Bermuda Bermuda offers a zero percent tax rate on crypto income, capital gains, and investment returns. It remains a top choice for crypto investors and businesses seeking regulatory clarity. Belarus Belarus has legalized crypto and offers no income or capital gains tax on crypto transactions for individuals and businesses. The government is actively supporting blockchain innovation. Malta Malta is known for its crypto-friendly laws. No tax is applied on long-term gains if crypto is used as a store of value. However, frequent trading can be taxed under business income laws, with corporate tax rates up to 35%. Some entities may reduce this to as low as 5% depending on structure. Worst Countries for Crypto Taxes in 2025 Country Crypto Tax Rate India 30% capital gains + 1% TDS Spain Up to 47% on income, 28% on gains Netherlands 32% tax on presumed gains Denmark 40% personal income tax South Africa Up to 18% capital gains + 45% income tax India India has imposed a flat 30% capital gains tax on all crypto earnings and a 1% TDS on transactions. There’s no deduction for losses , making the regime one of the most aggressive globally. Spain Spain taxes high-income crypto users at 47% and applies a 28% capital gains tax on profits over €300,000. Crypto earnings from staking, DeFi, or mining are taxed as regular income. Netherlands The Netherlands applies a 32% tax on presumed gains , even if crypto assets aren’t sold. This applies to digital asset portfolios exceeding €300,000, regardless of trading activity. Denmark Denmark imposes a 40% personal income tax on crypto gains . Loss offsets are limited—only 30% of losses can be deducted from taxable gains. South Africa Crypto in South Africa is subject to 18% capital gains tax and up to 45% income tax . Lack of clear guidance on DeFi, airdrops, or forks adds confusion for users and businesses. Countries That Banned Crypto but Have No Tax Policy These countries have no crypto tax laws , not because they’re tax havens, but because crypto is banned or heavily restricted : China Egypt Bangladesh Algeria Iraq Ethiopia Crypto use is not legally allowed in these nations, so tax rules are irrelevant. Conclusion In 2025, a growing number of countries are tightening their grip on cryptocurrency taxation. Yet, a few crypto-friendly countries continue to offer tax-free regimes, attracting serious investors and major Web3 firms. Countries like Portugal , once tax-free, now impose crypto taxes, proving how fast the global landscape can change.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/top-crypto-tax-free-countries-in-2025/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING|ASIA|BTC","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T09:15:50,"Will Bitcoin and AVAX Dominate Q3, or Will Retail Rotate to Meme Favorites Like Dogecoin?","The opening days of Q3 feel like the start of a boxing match: Bitcoin in one corner, institutional capital behind it; Avalanche (AVAX) in another, promising faster settlements; and a rowdy crowd of meme coins, spearheaded by Dogecoin, taunting both heavyweights from the ringside. Analysts ask whether blue-chip names will keep control or if retail traders will again sprint toward lighter, wilder tokens. Into this clash steps MAGACOIN FINANCE, an up-and-coming political meme coin that claims it can marry narrative flair with solid fundamentals. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Steal the Spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE is an early-stage memecoin project backed by strong fundamentals and a viral community. On-chain trackers show a clear rise in unique wallets and a jump in average holding size as the project heads into Stage 3 of its presale, evidence that accumulation is replacing quick flips. Unlike many meme tokens, MAGACOIN backs its buzz with structure. The supply is permanently capped at 170 billion coins, a guardrail meant to avoid the dilution that haunts older memes. Governance remains venture-capital-free, so every material change rises and falls on community votes without risk of selling pressure due to VC unlocks. That bottom-up governance model reflects the coin’s political brand and has become a talking point in analyst notes that compare MAGACOIN’s cultural pull to Dogecoin’s early years. Bitcoin’s High-Pressure Summer Standard Chartered’s desk sees Bitcoin pressing toward $135,000 by late quarter, driven by ETF inflows and a fading dollar. Although other analysts caution that historical mid-year slumps and fresh geopolitical jitters could still derail the charge, the broader uptrend remains intact. If Bitcoin does push past the psychological $110,000 mark, past cycles suggest retail liquidity eventually trickles down the ladder, often igniting meme rallies a few weeks later. That timing matters to traders, whether to sit in the heavyweight champion or front-run the next rotation. Avalanche Looks for Its Cue Avalanche spent June around $17, with chart analysts flagging a potential breakout above $20 as a gateway to a steeper climb. Medium-term projections peg a $30–$35 band, which is plausible in early Q3 if ecosystem growth holds pace. Still, some research desks note that “smart money” has begun inching toward higher-beta plays in DeFi spin-offs, suggesting that AVAX may need fresh catalysts to keep attention once meme season revs up. Dogecoin and the Retail Pulse Dogecoin rarely stays silent for long. Although it is down more than 40% this year, experts still believe the original meme coin can have some quick turnaround with increased liquidity and spill-over energy from Bitcoin highs. History shows that liquidity splinters into newer memes within days whenever DOGE catches a bid, and there are already signs of large wallets reallocating away from DOGE toward “next-gen” meme plays with clearer narratives and tighter tokenomics. A Three-Way Tug-of-War Put side by side, Bitcoin offers perceived safety and a shot at a historic milestone. Avalanche AVAX provides a technological story and mid-cap upside, and Dogecoin and its meme entourage promise adrenaline. MAGACOIN FINANCE tries to fold parts of each recipe into one dish: the resonance of a cultural storyline, the discipline of a capped supply, and the practicality of zero transaction fees. If Bitcoin rallies first, as many expect, meme coins typically follow. Should that pattern repeat, a community-driven token with audit credentials might be the one that grabs the microphone when retail enthusiasm peaks. Did I hear someone say MAGACOIN Finance? Yes, that’s the token to eye!

2025-07-12T09:15:48,"AI Predicts When XRP Will Trade at $10","Google’s advanced AI model, Gemini, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over XRP’s price trajectory, offering a data-driven prediction that is already attracting attention. With XRP showing notable gains over the past week and Bitcoin’s exceptional year-to-date performance reinforcing bullish sentiment in the market, Gemini’s forecast comes at a time of growing optimism for the digital asset. Analysts are closely watching the interplay of market dynamics, regulatory shifts, and investor confidence, which together seem to be setting the stage for further appreciation. Recent Market Performance Points to Strength XRP is currently trading at $2.77, reflecting a 7% increase in the past 24 hours and a 24% gain over the past seven days. These moves mirror broader market strength, particularly evident in Bitcoin’s performance. Over the last year, Bitcoin has surged by more than 106%, rising from $57,000 to $177,800, and has climbed an additional 9% in just the last week. This sustained momentum in Bitcoin often trickles down to altcoins, historically lifting XRP and other assets during bullish market cycles. Many observers believe that continued strength in Bitcoin could create favorable conditions for XRP to test higher levels. Another factor underpinning this renewed optimism is the resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit, which had clouded XRP’s regulatory status for years, concluded favorably for Ripple, easing investor concerns about potential enforcement risks. This development has been widely viewed as removing a major overhang on XRP’s price. Regulatory Climate Has Improved In addition to the lawsuit’s resolution, a recent analysis published in the Securing the Rights of Cryptocreditors journal highlighted the shifting regulatory environment as a critical element in XRP’s resurgence. The journal observed that “the change in the U.S. administration has paved the way for XRP to continue to increase in value,” citing a more crypto-friendly approach under President Trump’s administration and an overall recalibration of regulatory priorities. This shift has helped alleviate some of the pressure that had previously restrained XRP, allowing the market to reassess its long-term potential without the same degree of regulatory uncertainty. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Gemini’s $10 Prediction by December Against this backdrop of improved fundamentals and sentiment, Google Gemini’s AI-generated forecast provides a clear target for investors. According to Gemini, XRP is expected to trade at $10 by December. The AI model’s analysis incorporates current price momentum, the bullish environment in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, and the easing of regulatory risks as significant drivers of price appreciation over the coming months. “Based on technical indicators and market trend analysis, XRP has the potential to reach $10 by the end of this year,” Gemini’s forecast states. This projection represents a significant increase from current levels, but it aligns with the prevailing optimism among market participants who view XRP as undervalued relative to its utility and market position. As market conditions evolve, investors will continue to monitor how well XRP can sustain its upward trajectory and whether the factors identified by Google Gemini and other analysts will materialize as expected. For now, the combination of strong technical performance, improved regulatory clarity , and bullish sentiment appears to support the view that XRP’s upward momentum could carry it toward the $10 mark in the months ahead.

2025-07-12T09:15:34,"Bitcoin Could Explode by 112% Before End of Year, According to Analyst Michaël van de Poppe – But There’s a Catch","Analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) is primed to go much higher after the flagship crypto asset broke into a new all-time high. Van de Poppe tells his 795,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could reach a price of $250,000 in the fourth quarter – an increase of around 112% from the current level. According to the widely followed analyst, Bitcoin could hit a price of $125,000 this month and $150,000 between July and the end of September. However, Van de Poppe expects the rally to pause before his targets can be reached. “Probably going to stall for a little before we’ll continue.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading at $117,915 at time of writing, up by around 10% over the past week. Turning to Ethereum ( ETH ), the widely followed analyst says the second-largest crypto asset by market cap appears bullish and could rise to levels last witnessed in November of 2021. “A vertical candle upwards. Now, some patience and then we’ll continue to the all-time highs.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Ethereum is trading at $2,980 at time of writing, up by nearly 20% over the past seven days but down by approximately 40% from the all-time high reached close to four years ago. Lastly, Van de Poppe believes that the downtrend in the total market capitalization of altcoins versus Bitcoin is about to reverse . The widely followed analyst says altcoins are forming a bullish divergence against Bitcoin on the weekly time frame – an indication that altcoins are bottoming out against the flagship crypto asset. A bullish divergence occurs when the price of an asset is forming lower lows while an oscillator like the relative strength index (RSI) is forming higher highs.

2025-07-12T08:52:38,"Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Leads the Charge Above $3,000 – Has Crypto Summer Season Officially Begun?","Ethereum (ETH) briefly touched $3,000 this weekend, and the market is feeling optimistic again. Currently at $2,969, ETH is showing a sustained breakout with high volume and bullish indicators. After weeks of steady gains, Crypto Summer may have finally arrived. ETH lost 0.41% in early weekend trading, but the trend is still intact. ETH is up 9% in the last 5 days and outperforming most altcoins. This is more than a short term spike, it’s institutional demand and growing confidence in Ethereum’s long term. SharpLink’s ETH Buy is Institutional Trust A big catalyst for this momentum is the $25.72 million private OTC deal between the Ethereum Foundation and Nasdaq listed SharpLink Gaming. The esports marketing firm bought 10,000 ETH at $2,572 per token, now holds 215,957 ETH worth over $600 million. SharpLink has acquired 10,000 $ETH directly from the ethereum foundation. They are now holding 215,000+ $ETH . pic.twitter.com/tQh94jUbXS — Satoshi Stacker (@StackerSatoshi) July 11, 2025 SharpLink’s CEO Joseph Lubin said the purchase is part of the company’s long term strategy, not speculative trading. The Ethereum Foundation said the OTC route was chosen to avoid market disruption, open market sales can be heavy on the price. Deal Size: 10,000 ETH for $25.72M Average Purchase Price: $2,572 Current Holding Value: Over $600M Market Reaction: SharpLink stock up 17% So institutional confidence is high and ETH is above $3,000 without profit taking. Investors see this as a vote of long term confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its utility across Web3, DeFi and tokenization. ETF Inflows Mean Strong Demand Ahead To top it off, U.S. spot ETH ETFs saw their second-largest daily inflow of $383.1 million at the end of last week. Total 5-day inflow is $851.73 million, and total inflows are over $5 billion ahead of their 1-year anniversary on July 23. BlackRock’s ETHA drew in $300.93 million in one day. The biggest $ETH ETF inflow in history just hit: $383M in a day. $12.5B now parked in Ethereum. Institutions are front-running the next leg. Still sidelined? You’re gonna feel it at $10,000. pic.twitter.com/eXiSvP20rP — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) July 12, 2025 These ETFs are not only absorbing supply but also helping ETH find price stability in a volatile market. Since Ethereum’s 2022 proof-of-stake transition, supply has been dwindling. Over the last nine trading days, ETF inflows have outpaced ETH supply, creating a supply squeeze. With crypto conferences and ETF milestones in July, many see this as the start of Ethereum’s next leg up. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Technical and Trade From a charting perspective, Ethereum price prediction seems bullish as it has broken out of an ascending channel since March. Daily RSI is at 72, indicating strong momentum but overbought conditions. No reversal candles yet, bulls are in control. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Ethereum Trade Outlook Entry: $2,864 (pullback zone) Stop-Loss: Below $2,700 (mid channel support) Targets: $3,126 (resistance), then $3,432 (channel top) A bullish engulfing or hammer candle at support would be additional confirmation for dip buyers. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $2 million in its public presale, with $2,511,140 out of a $2,846,221 target. The token is priced at $0.012225, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction.

2025-07-12T08:50:07,"Why Pi Network Coin Price is Dropping","The post Why Pi Network Coin Price is Dropping appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network Coin holders are feeling the heat as token price drops by 9% while the entire crypto market enjoys strong gains. While Bitcoin has smashed a new all-time high, Pi Coin keeps slipping closer to its all-time low $0.40. Many are now wondering why the Pi network coin price is dropping. Pi Network Coin Drops 9% In the past 24 hours alone, Pi Coin has dropped about 9% and now trades near $0.471, not far from its lowest level ever, $0.40. This looks worse when you compare it to the rest of the crypto market, which is all green. Bitcoin is above $118,000 and Ethereum crossed $3,000, but Pi keeps moving the other way. Even the recent Pi2Day celebration , which was supposed to boost excitement in the Pi community, couldn’t lift the price. Over the last two weeks, Pi has fallen more than 29%, showing just how deep this downtrend has become. Token Unlock Adds More Pressure One big reason behind Pi’s continued slide is the massive token unlock happening this July. Between July 8 and July 15, over 100 million PI tokens about 1.5% of the total supply will hit the market. On one day alone, 10.1 million tokens will be unlocked. These unlocked tokens often end up being sold by big holders, which adds extra selling pressure when there aren’t enough buyers to balance it out. Many whales are taking profits by selling, and that weighs heavily on the price. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Bull Run Gains Momentum, Here’s When Altcoin Season Might Start , Pi Technicals Still Look Weak The technical side isn’t offering much comfort either. Pi Coin is trading inside a clear downward channel. Each time it tries to break higher, sellers push it back down. The trading volume is also low at $19.95 million, which shows that buyers don’t have enough strength to flip the trend just yet. However, Pi Network RSI has also reflected a bearish sentiment as it is currently at 39.8 reflecting an over-sold. What’s Next for Pi Coin? For now, the risks look bigger than the chances of a sudden turnaround. With so many tokens unlocking and big holders ready to sell, Pi could easily slip back to test the $0.40 zone or even drop into the $0.35 or $0.38 range if things get worse. Until Pi sees stronger buying interest, emergency liquidity, or a big exchange listing, the price may stay stuck in this bearish phase. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Large token unlocks, like the 100+ million PI tokens being released in July, typically increase the circulating supply. This creates selling pressure as holders take profits, weighing down the price due to insufficient buying demand. What is the short-term outlook for Pi Coin’s price?

2025-07-12T08:47:32,"XLM Explodes by 22% Followed by XRP, BTC Price Calms at $118K: Weekend Watch","Bitcoin’s spectacular end to the business week, in which the asset gained over ten grand and skyrocketed to a new all-time high, has finally reached an exhaustion point as the asset has calmed at $118,000. Several altcoins have followed suit, while XRP, CRO, and especially XLM have charted mindblowing gains. BTC’s Rally It’s been a while since we have said this, but a lot can change in the cryptocurrency markets in the span of a few days. Recall that itcoin’s price stood within a tight range between $105,000 and $110,000 for a few weeks, and each breakout attempt in both directions was stopped in its tracks. However, that all came to an end on Wednesday evening when the asset finally broke out of the upper boundary and shot up to a new all-time high of $112,000. After a brief retracement, the cryptocurrency began an even more impressive rally that resulted in tapping $116,000 on Thursday evening, but BTC went all the way up to almost $119,000 on Friday morning. Although it has lost some traction since then and now trades just under $118,000, bitcoin has gained over 9% on a weekly scale. Its market capitalization has grown to $2.345 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has declined slightly to 62.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XLM Steals the Show Most altcoins posted mindblowing gains over the past few days as well, but have calmed since yesterday. Ethereum, for instance, went from $2,500 to over $3,000 to market a five-month peak before it corrected slightly to just under the latter. In contrast, XRP was a little sluggish at first but took the spotlight yesterday by surging to almost $3. Although it has dropped below $2.8 now, it’s still 7% up on the day, and it overtook USDT in terms of market cap. CRO has charted a similar price surge over the past day, taking it to well over $0.1. However, the day belongs to XLM, which has exploded by more than 22% and now trades above $0.37. Pi Network’s native token, on the other hand, has plunged by over 6% and struggles to remain above $0.47. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets gained over $300 billion since Wednesday and stands at $3.750 trillion on CG now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-12T08:27:11,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: The Dollar’s Dip, BTC’s Rise – Is $300,000 Within Reach This Year?","Bitcoin is holding at $117,761, up 8% this week, while the US dollar is looking tired. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against major currencies, closed at 94.73, just above recent lows and down 10.4% from its 2022 high.

Some want to wait, others see inflation risks that require more tightening. Markets are pricing in a 50% chance of a July rate cut—a coin flip that keeps traders on edge. In crypto, the picture is clearer. ETF hopes are building despite the SEC delaying Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF. Analysts think more crypto ETFs are coming as institutions start to treat Bitcoin like digital gold. This narrative makes BTC a better hedge against rate changes and geopolitical risk. Meanwhile, Peter Schiff is telling everyone to sell Bitcoin for silver and the market is ignoring him. BTC is up 6% after his warning and many are citing institutional inflows and strong technicals as reasons to stay long. Trade Setup and Risks to Watch Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, therefore, for a continuation trade, here’s a setup: Entry: Pullback to $116,950 (0.5 Fib) Stop-Loss: Below $112,500 (0.382) Targets: $121,378 (0.618), $124,682, $127,681 This is a Fibonacci confluence and trend play. Look for reversal signs—spinning top or Doji—at resistance levels. But risks remain. The July 12 Fed minutes could be volatile if the tone turns hawkish. And the US government’s tariff policies—especially towards BRICS countries like South Africa—will impact global risk sentiment and crypto indirectly. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s technical breakout, a weak dollar, and growing ETF hopes mean more upside could be ahead. Whether BTC gets to $300,000 this year is a confluence of events—Fed policy, institutional adoption, and macro volatility. But for now, bulls are in control.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview Chainlink Price Target July 2025 LINK Price Prediction 2025 Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $ 15.34148782 -0.87% Market Cap $ 10,403,062,437.4031 Trading Volume $ 663,830,646.5098 Circulating Supply 678,099,970.4528 All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 Chainlink Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trying to reverse the decline from mid-May caused by a change in geopolitical factors. The end of June onwards LINK showed bullish reawakening in the short term with BTC rallying and its price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $15 mark after witnessing a short-term rally. Based on price action, a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if it breaks below $13, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK’s price began to rise again, but in past 15-days it is attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

The whale had collected the Bitcoins at $84,861, a profit of approximately $68.8 million at current prices. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also experiencing significant activity.

The rally mirrors broader strength across the crypto market, as investors pile into risk assets amid fresh regulatory momentum and a record-breaking run for Bitcoin. The Ripple ( XRP ) token jumped as high as $2.9695 on July 11, its highest level since March 2, driven by three key factors: Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) surge to an all-time high of $118,300, accelerating inflows into the new leveraged XRP exchange traded fund, or ETF, and renewed investor optimism following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s appearance in Washington ahead of the proposed CLARITY Act. Combined with bullish technical signals—including a breakout from a months-long triangle pattern—the rally has traders eyeing a return to the coin’s year-to-date peak of $3.3930. The recently launched Teucrium 2X Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP) continued to attract investors, with its assets increasing to $248 million. It has experienced inflows in every week since its launch in April, and its daily volume has increased significantly.

Unlike most ETFs, which have an expense ratio of less than 0.50%, the fund’s ratio stands at 1.89%. This means that a $10,000 investment costs about $189.

Currently priced at $117,430, the asset has gained 5% in the past 24 hours and 9% over the past week, reflecting growing investor confidence. While numerous analysts have offered varied projections, Google’s AI platform Gemini has added its voice to the broader conversation around Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Post-Tariff Rally Begins with “Liberation Day” Much of the current momentum in Bitcoin’s price can be traced back to early April, when a major geopolitical and economic development changed investor behavior. On April 2, President Donald Trump declared what he called “Liberation Day,” a sweeping policy shift involving an aggressive package of tariffs aimed at rebalancing global trade. This announcement initially triggered a downturn in traditional stock markets. However, Bitcoin moved in the opposite direction, climbing from around $70,000 to its present range. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Boosts Institutional Confidence One of the most consequential actions that followed Liberation Day was President Trump’s executive order to establish a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Describing it as a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold, the president outlined the need for a sovereign digital asset buffer in an increasingly uncertain financial world. This historic decision marked the first formal effort by the United States to incorporate Bitcoin into its national reserve strategy, signaling to the global market that the asset was now being viewed through a national security and long-term value lens. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bitcoin’s Supply Structure Reinforces Store-of-Value Status These policy moves have coincided with heightened interest from institutional investors, many of whom now view Bitcoin not only as a hedge against inflation but also as a geopolitical asset. Bitcoin’s unique structure, particularly its limited supply of 21 million coins, has always invited comparisons to gold. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be expanded at will by central banks, Bitcoin’s fixed issuance model ensures scarcity, a quality that becomes attractive in times of economic volatility or strategic financial repositioning. Google Gemini Forecasts Bitcoin to Hit $120,000 by Month-End As market participants adjust to these developments, Google Gemini has analyzed the underlying data and market indicators to offer a short-term forecast. According to its assessment, Bitcoin is expected to reach approximately $120,000 by July 31, 2025, representing a 2.1% increase from current levels. Gemini stated: “Based on current momentum and macroeconomic catalysts, Bitcoin is on track to climb approximately 2.1% to $120,000 by July 31.” This projection is grounded in a synthesis of price trends, supply-demand mechanics, and the broader policy environment. With less than three weeks until the end of the month, market observers are paying close attention to how Bitcoin performs relative to Gemini’s forecast.

2025-07-12T07:40:09,"Are Binance Founder CZ and Donald Trump in an Alliance? Here are the Allegations","Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has been revealed to be providing behind-the-scenes support to a crypto venture owned by the Trump family, according to Bloomberg. This aid comes at a time when Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) is seeking clemency from US President Donald Trump. According to three sources familiar with the matter, Binance wrote the underlying software code for the stablecoin USD1, launched by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial Inc. This technical support includes developing the “smart contract” that governs the creation of USD1. This coin was used in the spring when a United Arab Emirates-based investment firm purchased a $2 billion stake in Binance. More than two months after this major transaction, approximately 90% of USD1 tokens in circulation are still held in Binance wallets, according to on-chain data. The interest income generated by these assets could generate tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue for the Trump family. Binance also introduced USD1 to its 275 million user base, a privilege often coveted by stablecoin issuers. Related News: Grayscale Sends Special Letter to SEC Regarding XRP, Solana, and Cardano ETFs - Here's What It Says So, publicly available data and testimony from people familiar with the situation suggest that Binance was directly involved in the creation, promotion, and largest-ever transaction of USD1. However, it remains unclear whether Binance or Zhao received any payment from the Trump family for this service. Binance's statement said USD1 had gone through the exchange's “standard listing process.” It emphasized that CZ was no longer CEO and that the amnesty application was a “personal decision.” Zhao did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment. A spokesperson for World Liberty declined to elaborate on the relationship with Binance, but said, “Your allegations are baseless and intended to feed a political agenda.” It's unclear how the companies first made contact. However, two sources familiar with the matter claimed that CZ met with Steve Witkoff, a Trump associate and co-founder of World Liberty, at a Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi in December. At the time, Zhao had just been released from federal custody after a short sentence for violating anti-money laundering regulations, while Binance had paid over $4 billion in fines to US authorities. A member of Witkoff's inner circle denied that the meeting took place. Witkoff, previously appointed as a diplomat by Trump, was reportedly in the process of transferring his shares in World Liberty to his sons. White House Counsel David Warrington stated that Witkoff managed this process in accordance with ethical rules. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-12T07:34:55,"Crypto Traders Eye $130K Bitcoin as Majors Price-Action Shows Market Structure Shift","Bitcoin’s rally to $120,000 this week has sparked a broader breakout across major crypto assets, with ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, XRP, and dogecoin (DOGE) all posting high single-digit percentage gains. However, this time, price action isn’t just about momentum, as traders claim that market structure is evolving under the weight of institutional influence. “This isn’t a frenzied boom with no foundation,” said Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank. “It’s a measured ascent, backed up by large institutional players with the long-term in mind.” Rocca pointed to tight monetary policy and geopolitical volatility as reinforcing Bitcoin’s emerging role as a macro hedge, adding that “the momentum we’ve seen over the last 48 hours is clear. Bitcoin isn’t just growing in value, but also as a genuine asset class that is rivalling traditional finance.” Ethereum, up over 17% on the week and briefly crossed $3,000, remains a primary beneficiary. ""In Q2, corporate treasury purchases of BTC outpaced inflows into spot ETFs,"" said the analytics team at Bitcoin yield protocol TeraHash in a note to CoinDesk. ""That points to strategic positioning. At the same time, custodians like Anchorage and Fidelity are scaling institutional pipelines, while OTC desks are tightening spreads."" Solana, now trading around $163, gained over 11% on the week amid renewed demand across retail and memecoin ecosystems. The chain continues to act as a high-beta proxy for risk-on sentiment. XRP, meanwhile, jumped 25%, benefiting from both a technical breakout and rising speculation around regulatory resolution. “Price action may grab the spotlight,” TeraHash added, “but the real breakthrough this summer is structural.” The altcoin move is broad-based. Dogecoin has rallied 23% over the past week, driven by increased retail participation through platforms like Robinhood and Binance. XRP volumes have spiked on Korean exchanges, while Cardano, TRX, and AVAX are all trading firmly in the green. Meanwhile, Bitpanda Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said that “strong bitcoin rallies are often followed by significant movements in altcoins with a slight delay — and a potential comeback of meme coins can’t be ruled out either.” But not everyone sees a straight line up. “Despite briefly touching this key milestone, BTC remains below a major resistance zone,” said Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler, said in an email. “A decisive breakout and sustained move above this level could trigger a sharp upward rally, potentially targeting the $130,000 range,” Lienkha added.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/12/crypto-traders-eye-130k-bitcoin-as-majors-price-action-shows-market-structure-shift,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|DOGE|SOL","Markets|btc|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T07:30:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Climbs But Eyes Are On This DeFi Coin That Could Explode 40x","As Bitcoin (BTC) makes modest gains and reclaims investor attention with its latest price climb, the real buzz is building around a lesser-known but rapidly emerging player in the DeFi ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 65% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $12.1 million has already been raised, with a total of more than 13,100 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on investments made in Phase 5. While BTC’s momentum signals strength in the broader crypto market, analysts and insiders are zeroing in on Mutuum Finance. Bitcoin Reclaims Momentum Amid ETF and Macro Tailwinds Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to roughly $118,016, setting fresh highs in response to substantial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, declining on‑exchange supply, and growing investor optimism around potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts slated for September. Bolstered by upbeat institutional sentiment and regulatory clarity, including a strategic U.S. crypto reserve, the leading digital asset has reclaimed all‑time high territory and is eyeing a move toward the $120,000 level. With on‑chain metrics pointing to record low liquid supply, analysts suggest Bitcoin may continue its ascent into August. Amid this backdrop, sector watchers remain alert to emerging DeFi protocols, such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Reaches $12.1M Milestone in Presale The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13100 investors and has raised more than $12.1 million. Investors have picked up more than 65% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Starts Major Token Giveaway Event Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of $10,000 in MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded under its newly introduced leaderboard system. As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. How Mutuum Finance Is Transforming Lending in DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets. It is a workable multifunctional double-lending system, which incorporates the synergy of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, lending pools are utilized via smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like meme coins. While Bitcoin (BTC) continues its upward momentum, climbing past $118,000 amid ETF inflows and macro tailwinds, the real breakout potential may lie in the DeFi sector, where Mutuum Finance is gaining serious traction. With over $12.1 million raised and more than 13,100 early investors, Mutuum’s Phase 5 presale is already 65% sold out at a price of $0.03, offering investors a 100% ROI at listing. As excitement builds ahead of Phase 6, analysts are projecting a potential 40x upside by year-end, thanks to Mutuum’s innovative dual lending model and fully audited smart contracts. Secure your tokens now before Phase 5 closes, and claim your share of the $100,000 token giveaway.

2025-07-12T07:20:59,"Expert Says Don’t Be Surprised If XRP Suddenly Hits $4 This Week","The ongoing bullish momentum in XRP is fueling strong conviction and bold predictions once again. At press time, XRP is trading at $2.77, having surged over 7% in the past 24 hours. Earlier today, XRP reached an intraday high of $2.96 before pulling back slightly.For context, XRP last traded at this level in the first week of March, meaning the coin is now at an impressive four-month high. This surprising turnaround is fueling bold predictions from analysts and market watchers. Many now believe that a path to a new all-time high is more likely than ever.XRP to $4+ This Week?In a tweet , crypto educator Edoardo Farina stated that it wouldn’t be surprising if market participants woke up to see XRP trading above $4 as early as this week.Notably, XRP has remained below its peak for over seven and a half years, but optimism is growing for a breakout this month.Farina’s comment reflects the growing anticipation within the XRP community, as the coin rides a wave of renewed market enthusiasm. This comes as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high above $118,800, with XRP following suit.As Bitcoin continues to trade above $118,000, it has given altcoins significant room to outperform. XRP’s weekly performance now stands at an impressive 25% gain.Farina’s $4 prediction would represent roughly a 50% surge from current levels and would push XRP beyond its all-time high of $3.84, set in January 2018. According to some XRP commentators, until the coin breaks this stubborn peak, its price action remains relatively unremarkable.However, for analysts like Farina, the breakout is increasingly likely. In his view, it may not occur gradually but could happen suddenly and unexpectedly, fueled by FOMO.“Altcoin Season Not Even Here Yet”Commenting on the post, one X user highlighted that the Altcoin Season Index is still only at 28/100. This figure implies Bitcoin is still outperforming most altcoins. In other words, the main altcoin frenzy has yet to begin, and XRP's current rally is already impressive. Many see the coin as positioning itself for even higher price levels.https://twitter.com/Beaub9/status/1943842004410282365This perspective is widely shared among influential voices in the crypto space. Commentators like Alex Cobb have forecasted XRP reaching over $22.50 by December. Other analysts speculate that XRP could soon overtake Ethereum if current momentum continues.“Holding XRP Should Be a Priority”As a result, analysts like Oscar Ramos urge investors to prioritize XRP as the broader market turns bullish. Contributing to the optimism are developments such as Ripple’s partnership with BNY to streamline operations, and its efforts to secure a bank charter and a Federal Reserve master account to expand RLUSD adoption. RLUSD, now the 8th-largest stablecoin, runs on the XRP Ledger and uses XRP for transaction fees.Momentum is also building for an XRP ETF, with ProShares and others launching futures-based ETFs in July. More than 10 spot ETF applications are currently under SEC review.Meanwhile, whale accumulation is nearing record highs, with 2,742 wallets holding over 47.3 billion XRP.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/12/expert-says-dont-be-surprised-if-xrp-suddenly-hits-4-this-week/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-dont-be-surprised-if-xrp-suddenly-hits-4-this-week,"XRP|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T07:08:56,"Wall Street Bets Big — $3.6B Pours Into Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs Weekly","The demand for cryptocurrency on Wall Street is more than evident, and the past week only proved that narrative. The ETFs tracking the performance of the two largest digital assets recorded a highly impressive five-day trading period, attracting billions of dollars in total. In the meantime, the prices of both skyrocketed to a multi-month and an all-time high. Bitcoin ETFs See Over $2.5B in Net Inflows Let’s begin with the most impressive numbers, which came in the last two trading days of the week. Data from FarSide shows that Thursday saw the biggest new inflow day since early November and the second-largest in the 18-month history of the funds. $1,175.6 billion went into the financial vehicles, which were distributed somewhat evenly between three of the biggest – $448.5 million into BlackRock’s IBIT, $324.3 million into Fidelity’s FBTC, and $268.7 million into Ark Invest’s ARKB. Friday was almost as impressive, with $1,029.6 billion entering the funds. This time, though, IBIT dwarfed its competition, attracting $953.5 million. ARKB, which was second, was far, far behind, with a modest $23.5 million in net inflows. Adding the $215.7 million witnessed on Wednesday, $80.1 million on Tuesday, and $216.5 million on Monday, the total for the week stands at $2,717.5 billion. Somewhat expected, these mindblowing numbers affected the underlying asset’s price, which surged by over $10,000 to a new all-time high of almost $119,000 on Friday. What’s perhaps even more impressive is that all Bitcoin ETFs have seen only one negative day (July 1) since June 9. ETH ETFs Impress, Too The spot Ethereum ETFs , which are close to celebrating their first year in existence, have also become a lot more favorable among investors in the past few months. Moreover, they set a record in terms of daily inflows on Thursday, as reported , when $383.1 million entered the funds. Friday and Wednesday were also impressive in this regard, albeit in a more modest manner, with $204.9 million and $211.3 million going into the financial vehicles, respectively. On Monday and Tuesday, investors allocated $62.1 million and $46.7 million into the ETFs, bringing the total for the week to $908.1 million, according to data from FarSide. BlackRock’s ETHA has dominated the landscape once again, gaining over $300 million out of the $383.1 million on Thursday and $137.1 million out of the $204.9 million on Friday. ETH’s price has also benefited from the substantial interest in the Ethereum ETFs, shooting up this week from $2,500 on Wednesday to a multi-month high of its own at $3,040 on Friday. It has retraced slightly to just under $3,000 now, but it’s still up by over 17% on a weekly scale. In total, the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs attracted more than $3.6 billion in one week alone.

John Marshall, Goldman’s head of derivatives research, says in a new interview with CNBC that the brokerages Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) are benefiting from a surge in retail trading activity, which could boost their stock prices. “The retail activity – while they may not have been buying intensely over the last couple of months, they’ve been very active, and that should be a tailwind for both of them.” Marshall also says Goldman believes the equipment and machinery giant John Deere (DE) could benefit from the agricultural cycle, which the firm believes is at a cyclical bottom. Goldman Sachs’ other tactical trades related to Q2 earnings reports include the cloud-based data storage firm Snowflake (SNOW), the aircraft leasing company Air Lease Corporation (AL), the restaurant franchise giant YUM! (YUM) and the global branded food company Hormel Foods (HRL). In terms of stocks that could slide in price due to earnings reports, Marshall mentions the furniture giant Restoration Hardware (RH). “While they don’t report until September, that’s a name which has tough compares.” Other stocks that Goldman thinks could have potential downside include the airline giant Southwest (LUV) and the Boston Beer Company (SAM).

Trading volumes surged past 1.1B during the 13:00–15:00 session, establishing resistance between $0.208–$0.213. Support held at $0.200–$0.201 through late-session volatility, with final hour price action stabilizing around $0.202. Analysts flagged the rejection at $0.211 (20:00) as evidence of systematic profit-taking by larger holders. News Background: BTC Record, Risk-On Flows Drive Meme Coin Rally Bitcoin touched an all-time high of $118,000 during the session, as crypto markets benefited from a surge in institutional inflows — estimated at $50B this week alone. Easing geopolitical tensions, improving trade relations, and dovish signals from central banks have boosted risk assets across the board. Dogecoin, typically a high-beta play during crypto rallies, surged alongside altcoins in response. Price Action Summary Range: $0.198 → $0.213 → $0.202 | Total swing: 8.6% Breakout Zone: $0.200–$0.208 cleared on strong volume Resistance: $0.208–$0.213, with reversal from $0.211 Support: $0.200–$0.201 tested and held multiple times Final Hour (04:55–05:54): Price rose from $0.200 → $0.202 (+0.5%) Volume Peak: 1.1B between 13:00–15:00; 19M during 05:00–05:10 late surge Technical Analysis Mid-session momentum broke above key resistance zones but failed to sustain above $0.213 Volume-backed reversal near session high suggests strategic exits by institutions Final-hour recovery shows $0.200 remains psychologically significant Momentum cooling; near-term consolidation expected in $0.200–$0.204 band What Traders Are Watching Can DOGE reclaim and hold above $0.208–$0.210 to retest highs? Breakdown below $0.198–$0.200 would signal trend exhaustion Consolidation above $0.202 would support a bullish continuation setup into next week Broader BTC and macro risk sentiment will continue to dictate altcoin flows Takeaway DOGE followed broader crypto markets higher with a clean intraday breakout — but its rejection at $0.213 and sharp pullback highlight the fragile nature of meme coin rallies during high volatility sessions. Institutional flows remain, but traders should watch for volume confirmation before chasing upside. $0.200 is now the line in the sand.

2025-07-12T06:48:24,"Expert Explains Why XRP Is More Powerful Than Direct Connections","An intriguing post by financial expert Jake Claver has offered a fresh take on XRP’s core utility. Claver emphasized that “XRP doesn’t compete in many currency pair battles. Instead, it pools all liquidity into one central point.” This framing highlights a design where XRP acts as a unified bridge asset rather than a token tied to individual trading pairs. XRP doesn’t compete in many currency pair battles. Instead, it pools all liquidity into one central point. This makes XRP much more powerful than any single direct connection. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) July 10, 2025 Claver’s comment draws attention to XRP’s structural advantage in liquidity sourcing. Meanwhile, Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, had detailed how the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) auto‑bridge feature ensures XRP acts as a central intermediary , optimizing transactions between tokens and reinforcing its liquidity role on the ledger. This mechanism supports growing volumes of tokenized assets, translating into higher XRP usage for both fees and liquidity provision. XRP’s Growing Adoption and Infrastructure Over the longer horizon, the structural liquidity model Claver describes supports broader industry trends. Ripple has seen rapid adoption of its XRP-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product and a notable increase in partnerships, currently working with hundreds of financial institutions. The ODL system uses XRP to settle cross‑border transfers without requiring banks to maintain pre-funded accounts, and this innovation reduces cost and latency in global payments, making XRP a preferred option for cross-border payments. Additionally, XRP’s role is not sidelined by new stablecoin products like RLUSD. While one commenter expressed this concern, Schwartz has previously clarified that RLUSD enhances XRP’s function by introducing alternative settlement paths without reducing XRP’s bridging utility. Higher volumes of tokenized assets on XRPL also help the ecosystem, as it leads to escalating demand for XRP for transaction fees and liquidity. This dynamic affirms XRP as integral to the ledger’s long-term economic model. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX), automated market maker (AMM), and other features gain traction, the digital asset’s central role in enabling liquidity becomes more pronounced. Reactions Reflect Widespread Confidence Multiple community members responded enthusiastically to Claver’s post. Many echoed his assessment by highlighting XRP’s real‑world utility, contrasting it with assets that lack tangible use cases. One commenter shared excitement about XRP’s potential to outperform Bitcoin in practical applications, and another suggested that the asset could reach triple-digit targets by the end of the year. Others reaffirmed that Claver’s liquidity framing is consistent with XRP’s design and mission. XRP enjoys structural strengths often overlooked in speculative discourse, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has reaffirmed the importance of liquidity, predicting that it could capture 14% of SWIFT’s volume within 5 years by prioritizing liquidity provisioning.

2025-07-12T06:45:01,"Bitcoin Dumped for Ethereum: Bit Digital Bets $172M on ETH. Is This the End of Bitcoin Dominance?","A major shift in the crypto world has occurred. Bit Digital has made a massive $172 million move, favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin. This bold bet raises questions about the future of Bitcoin's leading position. What does this mean for the supremacy of cryptocurrencies? Could this signal a new era for other digital coins? The answers may surprise. Analysis powered by Outset PR , a blockchain PR agency that leverages data, trends, and market timing to empower Web3 leaders to maximize every opportunity. Bitcoin Price Flirts with New Highs: Bullish Momentum Builds Source: tradingview Bitcoin is showing strong movement, with prices hovering slightly above $107,000 to $111,000. It is just under a key resistance point at nearly $114,000. If Bitcoin breaks past this, it could aim for around $119,000, a potential jump of about 7%. With a six-month growth of almost 19%, Bitcoin’s upward momentum appears solid. Indicators like the RSI suggest high interest from buyers. The current pattern suggests further gains if Bitcoin maintains its pace and crosses resistance levels. Enthusiasts are hopeful even as cautious optimism prevails, as Bitcoin continues its climb, setting sights on breaking new records. Ethereum Surges: Can ETH Break Past $3000 Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price currently sits between $2420 and $2679, showing a positive trend with a 9.10% increase over the past week. Analysts highlight the nearest resistance level at $2787, which ETH might test soon. If it breaks through, the next target is $3047, promising a potential rise of about 14% from the current range. With the relative strength index near 68, ETH indicates strong momentum but is not overbought just yet. This suggests room for further growth. However, caution is advised as the nearest support at around $2269 could slow things down.
