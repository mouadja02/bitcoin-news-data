2025-07-12T20:45:00,"Bitcoin Momentum Rebuilds — TON and SUI Hit Technical Buy Zones","Bitcoin has officially reclaimed center stage, crossing the $118,000 mark for the first time in history. Fueled by a record-setting short squeeze and ETF inflows, the breakout is triggering capital shifts across the market. SUI and Toncoin are showing signs of strength—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, a decentralized political memecoin, that’s quietly entering buy-zone discussions among early-stage investors looking for high-conviction narratives in the next altcoin wave. Bitcoin’s Breakout Powered by Short Squeeze and ETF Inflows The Bitcoin rally has been nothing short of historic. Between July 10–11, over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated, marking the largest forced buyback event since January. Spot ETF inflows continue to accelerate, bringing institutional demand and long-term price pressure. Bitcoin 7-Days price chart from CoinGecko Market sentiment is bullish, with open interest now clustering at the $120K and $140K strike levels. U.S. legislators are also preparing pro-crypto bills as part of an upcoming “Crypto Week,” reinforcing optimism heading into Q3. But the more telling trend? Altcoin rotations are already underway—particularly toward early narratives and low-cap bets. SUI Holds Above $3.50 as DeFi Integrations Fuel Speculation SUI is emerging as one of the most technically robust altcoins this week. After integrating tBTC—a synthetic Bitcoin asset—into its DeFi ecosystem, SUI soared above $3.50 and confirmed its inverse head-and-shoulders breakout pattern. Analysts now point to $3.89 as the next resistance target, with institutional accumulation growing and daily volume tracking higher. It’s a clear indicator that DeFi-aligned narratives are back in focus, especially those with cross-asset bridges and liquidity inflows. But SUI’s surge is also creating spillover attention for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—those operating in entirely different lanes but benefiting from renewed risk appetite. TON Rebounds Near $2.97 After Visa Controversy Cools Down Toncoin (TON) is stabilizing near $2.97 after weathering a wave of investor uncertainty related to its failed “golden visa” pilot in the UAE. The TON Foundation clarified its limited role in the proposal, and traders are once again watching the charts. TON’s symmetrical triangle setup signals a potential volatility breakout. Support at $2.81 has held, and sentiment is slowly improving, although technical indicators remain mixed. Analysts caution that TON needs a clean break past $3.00 to resume its previous trend. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Political Altcoin Narrative Enters Buy-Zone Phase While BTC, SUI, and TON dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making noise where it matters—wallets, volume, and forums. The meme-powered altcoin recently passed $11.2 million raised with over 5,234 verified holders. But what’s attracting fresh attention is the breakout behavior: weekly volume is up 320%, and 1,500+ new wallets were created in under 48 hours. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t riding ETF news or protocol upgrades—it’s leading with ideological clarity. As a decentralized political memecoin, its zero-tax model, HashEx-audited contract, and capped 170B supply structure offer a scarcity play built on anti-centralization values. Early discussions suggest listing momentum could follow if current community traction continues. Traders who missed early SHIB or DOGE waves are calling MAGACOIN “the politically aligned altcoin for this cycle.” Final Thoughts Bitcoin is climbing. SUI is strengthening. TON is stabilizing. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging—fast. As traders look for early-stage opportunities beyond hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s mix of community governance, transparent supply, and political identity makes it a serious contender in the next meme altcoin breakout. For a market driven by narratives and timing, this decentralized political memecoin checks both boxes.

2025-07-12T20:26:00,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $0.7827 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7066 Market Cap $21 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $677 Million Circulating Supply 45 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7427 24-hour Low $0.6902 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.23% 50-day SMA $ 0.669534 14-Day RSI 47.74 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) has shown a strong bullish rebound on the 1-day chart on. J, climbing to approximately $0.71. The RSI stands at 66.28, suggesting increasing bullish momentum but also approaching the overbought threshold, which often precedes short-term consolidation. The MACD remains positive, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating sustained upward pressure. Bollinger Bands have widened with the price testing the upper band, reinforcing a volatile breakout move. If ADA maintains this strength, it could challenge the next resistance near $0.75 to $0.80. However, any pullback might retest the $0.68 zone as support before continuation or correction. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA), the price has demonstrated a strong recovery, trading near $0.705. The Bollinger Bands show expansion with ADA testing the upper band, signaling bullish volatility. The Balance of Power (0.83) favors buyers, suggesting dominance of bullish sentiment. However, the MACD histogram reveals some waning momentum as the MACD line dips slightly below the signal line, hinting at short-term indecision. Despite this, the overall structure supports a continuation of the uptrend if ADA holds above $0.68. Failure to maintain momentum could trigger a correction toward the middle Bollinger Band near $0.67 for support. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 0.591013 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.604081 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.586336 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.598662 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.669534 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.677483 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.612612 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 0.611091 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.635019 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.654165 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.669998 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.710588 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.747892 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.722727 SELL What to expect from Cardano price analysis next Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Cardano (ADA) is showing signs of bullish continuation with strong momentum building. On the 1-day chart, ADA has reclaimed the $0.70 zone and broken through the upper Bollinger Band, signaling heightened volatility and buyer strength. The RSI at 66.28 suggests ADA is approaching overbought territory but still has room to run. On the 4-hour chart, buyers remain in control, supported by a high Balance of Power (0.83) and expanding Bollinger Bands. If bulls sustain pressure above $0.68, ADA may target $0.75 next. A break below $0.68 could invite consolidation or retracement. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $5.97, with an average trading price of about $5.17 and a minimum price of $5.03. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano will reach $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $5.97. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $7.33 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $8.61. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.5823, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

Despite consensus expectations of a rate cut in the coming months, Dimon said in a speech in Ireland on Thursday that he thinks the market is underestimating the potential impact of inflation on the Fed’s policymaking, Reuters reports . “I think the possibility of those higher rates (is) higher than anybody else… The market is pricing a 20% chance. I would price in a 40-50% chance. I would put that as a cause for concern.” Dimon says the US government’s tariffs, immigration policies and budget deficit could all have inflationary impacts. Other voices in the financial sector have predicted the opposite for Fed policy. Goldman Sachs Research economists recently estimated there’s more than a 50% chance of the Fed cutting rates at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September, three months earlier than their previous prediction. The Goldman economists predict 25-basis-point cuts in September, October, and December, and March and June of 2026. The CME FedWatch Tool estimates there’s a 93.3% chance the Fed will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5% at the FOMC meeting in July. The tool, which generates probabilities using the 30-day Fed Funds futures prices, estimates there’s a 59.7% chance the Fed will cut the rate by 25 basis points at the FOMC meeting in September. FedWatch estimates a 0% chance of a rate hike this month or in September.

Institutional inflows remain robust, with over $45B in monthly ETF investments and continued accumulation by whale wallets and long-tenured holders emerging from dormancy. Key support now lies around $105K–$108K, while a sustained breakout above $114K could pave the way for a push toward $120K+.

ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030?

Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare

According to Wedson, the most interesting Bitcoin Power Law model suggests that the resistance zone lies in the $118.9k to $120k range. Wedson argued that for Bitcoin to break above these levels, it would need to break through a threshold previously identified as the “Alpha Price,” which was previously stated to be above $119,300. According to the analyst, breaking above this level is only possible after a period of consolidation and the elimination of overly optimistic investors from the market. Related News: A Signal for Big Accumulation in 18 Altcoins: Whales Withdrawing Huge Amounts to Cold Wallets from Binance “Once that happens, the doors to higher levels will be wide open,” Wedson said, noting that the potential peak level for this cycle could be in the $143,000 to $146,000 range. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,598, up 8.89% in the past week.

In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Robinhood CIO Stephanie Guild says that she believes the S&P 500 may close the year at around 6,200, though a move to 6,500 is on the table. “I started [the year] at 6,500. When tariffs hit, I said GDP could come down and that could impact earnings. Usually, a 1% hit on GDP is about a 4% hit on earnings. We’ve seen earnings expectations come down. I said there was risk to 5,800, but I never went there. And now I think there’s risk to 6,500 – obviously we’re over my target. But with the pumping up of potential tariffs now I’m just sort of waiting to see what happens… This is all driven by tariffs, but is driven by our president, who also cares about the economy and wants the economy to grow… If [the Fed] cut, then you definitely get 6,500…because then it just like reaffirms what the market has been hoping for.” Guild also says that ahead of next week’s bank earnings, she believes regional banks will outperform the big banks in the coming months. “I’m more bullish on the regionals than the large [banks]…I think they’ll just benefit more from deregulation. And if we do get some rate cuts this year, which I think we should, but obviously there are reasons why they haven’t been cut yet, then I think you do get a steeper [yield] curve and then that does help [regional banks] as well.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The DOJ says it has identified 324 defendants in an alleged $14.6 billion fraud scheme comprising of several different scam tactics targeting Americans. In one scheme that targeted vulnerable elderly patients – some of whom were in hospices – defendants are accused of applying medically unnecessary amniotic allografts to the patients’ wounds, and then receiving millions of dollars worth of illegal kickbacks from a fraudulent billing scheme. In another alleged fraud, 74 defendants, including 44 licensed medical professionals, are accused of illegally peddling 15 million pills of prescription opioids and other controlled substances. Another charge was filed in the Northern District of Illinois against five defendants, including two owners and executives at Pakistani marketing companies, whose alleged fraud involved a $703 million Medicare scam. The DOJ says victims of the scheme had their identification numbers and other confidential health information stolen through theft and deceptive marketing. As part of the investigation, the DOJ seized $245 million worth of cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency and other assets, “demonstrating the significant return on investment that results from health care fraud enforcement efforts.” Says Robert Murphy of the DEA, “Health care fraud isn’t just theft — it’s trafficking in trust. Today’s announcement shows that when doctors become drug dealers and treatment centers become profit-driven fraud rings, DEA will act… We’re targeting the entire ecosystem of fraud — from pill mills in Texas to kickback clinics exploiting Native communities.

2025-07-12T18:16:45,"As Ethereum ETFs gain on Bitcoin, retail investors see new options","Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had their best week since the launch with record net inflows of $907.99 million. This is the largest weekly inflow since Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024, per SoSoValue. The inflows were heavily concentrated on three consecutive days, July 9, 10, and 11, suggesting strong and sustained investor demand. The largest daily inflow occurred on July 10, when ETH ETFs had an influx of $383.10 million. The next two strongest days saw a similarly slight disparity: $211.32 million on July 9 and $204.82 million on July 11. According to market analyst Nate Geraci, ETH still sees strong inflows; three of ETH ETF’s top 10 inflow days have happened this week. Institutional demand is increasing, suggesting growing market sentiment for Ethereum products. This explosion is particularly strong given that Ethereum ETFs started out slowly. With better regulatory clarity and investors clamoring for them, 2025 looks like it will be their breakout year. ETH rally generates excitement among investors ETH is up over 17% over the last week, with a break and hold above $3,000 occurring on July 11. It’s the first time the token has returned to that psychological level in months. ETF purchases partially fuel the rally, which removes supply from the open market. Plus, since Ethereum gets widespread use across DeFi, smart contracts, and staking rewards, it’s still catching the eye of both retail and institutional investors. Ethereum’s surge in recent weeks has been sustained, with buying pressure showing few signs of ebbing, and not just a wave of speculators seeking quick gains, CoinMarketCap data shows. Analysts think that as long as macro is conducive, inflation and interest rates are stable, for example, Ethereum will be ready to move higher in the coming weeks. To add to the intrigue, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw its holdings over 2 million ETH as of July 10. That’s worth about $300 million — a reflection of the growing interest on Wall Street in Ethereum’s long-term value propositions. As Ethereum ETFs gain on Bitcoin, retail investors see new options Ethereum ETFs are encroaching on Bitcoin ETFs, the group that has dominated the crypto ETF space. Their 2024 launches were met with cautious optimism and lackluster retail flows for the most part. All of that is starting to change, and fast. According to reports, BlackRock is purchasing significantly more ETH than BTC. This indicates a narrative shift, with Wall Street investors warming up to the second-largest crypto by market cap. One thing setting off this interest is Ethereum’s use as a yield-producing asset through staking, which investors find appealing in a low-return world. The ETH price’s response was not immediate, although accumulation via the ETF would still reduce the coin’s supply. Thanks to its network, which has a dominant ecosystem play in dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFTs, ETH also has a strong utility-based value proposition. Suppose other traditional financial institutions enter the crypto market more. In that case, the Ethereum ETF market might expand, accounting for an even higher percentage of the overall crypto ETF market. Although Bitcoin leads the charge in total ETF volume, ETH is gaining on it quicker than most anticipated.

Kiyosaki warns Bitcoin ‘FOMO disease’ is coming","Author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has issued a cautionary message to Bitcoin ( BTC ) investors as the leading cryptocurrency trades at new highs. According to the Rich Dad Poor Dad author, investors should brace for a possible wave of panic buying driven by fear of missing out (FOMO), a trend he believes will result in losses for many, Kiyosaki said in an X post on July 11. Interestingly, Kiyosaki revealed that he recently bought more Bitcoin at $110,000, positioning himself for what he calls the “Banana Zone”, a phase of rapid price surges that typically attracts emotional, late-stage investors. He likened patient buyers to ‘pigs’ who benefit by accumulating early, while warning that impulsive ‘hogs’ risk losses by chasing inflated prices. He expects these latecomers to panic sell during market dips, while disciplined investors will wait to buy the dip. Another RICH DAD LESSON: “PIGs get fat. HOGs get slaughtered.” I state this lesson because I bought my latest BITCOIN at $110k.

He believes Bitcoin will outperform traditional assets amid the ongoing devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Kiyosaki’s perspective is rooted in his long-standing distrust of the dollar, which he refers to as “fake money,” and his broader support for alternative assets. As reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki has praised Bitcoin investors for rejecting the U.S. government and financial institutions, which he described as a “Den of Thieves.” He has also warned of a potential economic crash that could wipe out substantial wealth. In response, he continues to advocate for Bitcoin, gold , and silver as essential tools for preserving value. Kiyosaki regards Bitcoin, gold, and silver as equally important, dismissing the Bitcoin vs. gold debate as a distraction from deeper economic issues. All three assets have posted significant gains in 2025, even as the stock market, despite hitting new highs, has faced volatility. Featured image via Ben Shapiro’s YouTube . The post R.

2025-07-12T18:01:01,"New Banking Malware Hammers US and Canada, Reaches Over 50,000 Android Users in Just Six Days","A dangerous Android-based banking malware is rapidly spreading across the United States and Canada. Anatsa is capable of stealing banking credentials using various methods including overlay attacks and keystroke logging attacks, reports Threat Fabric. The banking malware can also conduct fraudulent transactions remotely from the infected Android devices. Threat Fabric says Anatsa is being distributed on the US Google Play app marketplace under various guises such as a PDF update, a file manager, a document viewer, a phone cleaner and other legitimate-appearing apps. Once installed, an update transforms it into malicious software. “Once the application gains a substantial user base – often in the thousands or tens of thousands of downloads – an update is deployed, embedding malicious code into the app. This embedded code downloads and installs Anatsa on the device as a separate application.” In the latest campaign, Threat Fabric says Anatsa was downloaded more than 50,000 times between June 24th and June 30th. Anatsa ranked third among the “Top Free Tools” category on the US Google Play app marketplace over that period. While Anatsa has been active since at least 2020 and has enjoyed consistently high levels of success, the mobile cybersecurity firm says this is the third instance where the banking malware is focusing on mobile banking users in the US and Canada. “The Anatsa malware campaigns continue to show a growing focus on North American targets, particularly mobile banking applications. The latest operation not only broadened its reach but also relied on well-established tactics aimed at financial institutions in the region.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This move was quite surprising, particularly as the process saw Bitcoin clearing its previous all-time high from late May by breaking above $111,970.

His analysis is based on the 5.618 Fibonacci extension, which is a number he says has perfectly aligned with every prior cycle top. The projection opens up the possibility of whether Bitcoin’s current move marks the start of another parabolic run. Related Reading: Market Expert Says It’s Now ‘Illegal’ To Short Bitcoin, Here’s Why CryptoCon’s technical chart analysis builds on the recurring 5.618 Fibonacci extension level in previous market cycles. The analyst shows how Bitcoin’s previous tops have fallen within striking distance of this precise extension by measuring the move of each market cycle and applying this golden ratio. The chart shown below features the $30.84 peak in June 2011, the $1,205 top in November 2013, the $18,702 high from December 2017, and the peak of $63,839 in November 2021. Each of these market tops, as shown in the Bitcoin multi-year price chart below, converged on the same 5.618 multiple from their preceding bear market lows. Now, using this same approach in the ongoing cycle, CryptoCon projected that the next major step for Bitcoin is somewhere between $170,000 and $180,000. Particularly, the 5.618 Fibonacci extension points to a “Golden Number” of $184,181 for Bitcoin’s price in this cycle. Bitcoin Price Compression Is About To Expand Violently Several major forces appear to have contributed to BTC’s recent surge in the past 48 hours. A significant short squeeze earlier in the week reportedly wiped out over $1 billion in bearish positions. At the same time, US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered over $1 billion in daily inflows in the past two consecutive days. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Breakdown — Here’s The Best Time To Buy In his X post, CryptoCon also commented on the current state of Bitcoin’s chart: “All the boring price action is coming to a squeeze; it can’t stay that way forever.” This observation reflects the long period of tight, sideways trading between $105,000 and $108,000 that Bitcoin experienced in the previous two weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,762, retracing slightly after reaching its most recent all-time high of $118,667, according to CoinGecko data. Other crypto analysts now find themselves watching the $130,000 region as another zone of consolidation activity on the way to the possible cycle peak.

2025-07-12T18:00:08,"Coinbase Sues Oregon Governor Over Crypto Policy Change – Details","Coinbase has filed a lawsuit against Oregon State Governor Tina Kotek over an abrupt change in the state’s policy on the regulation of digital assets. This lawsuit comes as a response to Oregon’s initial suit accusing the American exchange of operating as an unregistered securities issuer and trading platform. Coinbase Vs. Oregon In an X post on July 11, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal shared ongoing efforts by the crypto exchange to direct the Oregon State Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General (AG) Dan Rayfield to reveal public records that justify a recent change in the state’s crypto policy. According to the lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of State of Oregon for the County of Mason, Coinbase legal representatives explain that Oregon government officials have previously advised citizens that cryptocurrencies are regulated as commodities rather than securities.However, there appeared to be a shift in this policy when Oregon AG filed a charge against Coinbase in April 2025 with a complaint stating the exchange has acted as an unregistered securities platform by facilitating trading of a selected 31 digital assets – a lawsuit similar to that of the SEC against Coinbase in 2023 which has now been dropped by the regulatory body. The American exchange explains that such change in policy should be accompanied with public hearings and debate or an agency rulemaking consultation that involves relevant stakeholders. However, Coinbase alleges that the Oregon State Government followed none of these procedures with the new anti-crypto policy being adopted behind closed door meetings. Oregon Officials Blocking Citizens From Trading Crypto: Coinbase VP In a statement to local media The Washington Times, Ryan VanGrack, Coinbase’s Vice President of Litigation has shared his support of the exchange’s lawsuit against Tina Kotek accusing the Oregon State Government of attempting to taper its citizens’ access to the crypto market. VanGrack said: … why is Governor Kotek refusing to provide basic information about the case, including why the state suddenly flipped its views on crypto? Oregonians deserve to know why their government is keeping them in the dark — and why they’re pursuing a case that would deprive Oregonians (and only Oregonians) from trading crypto. Importantly, the Coinbase Exec has expressed intense disapproval at the timing and basis of Oregon’s initial lawsuit as the US Congress attempts to establish a crypto regulatory framework , especially with the upcoming vote on the GENIUS Act and Clarity Act.VanGrack further added: No one else has filed suit. It came after the federal government dismissed its case, and it is coming on the heels of bipartisan legislation; I can’t imagine a more illogical time for a state to peacock and insert itself when the federal government made it very clear it is their domain. At press time, the total crypto market cap is valued at $3.63 trillion following a 2.44% increase in the past day.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-sues-oregon-over-crypto-policy-change/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Coinbase|coinbase|Dan Rayfield|Oregon State|Paul Grewal|Ryan VanGrack|SEC|Tina Kotek",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T17:55:24,"Bitcoin’s Record Quarter Met With Silence From Elite Media – Who’s Really Out of Touch?","Market intelligence firm Bitcoin Perception reported that mainstream media coverage of Bitcoin in Q2 2025 remained deeply polarized. A total of 1,116 articles were published across 18 major outlets, which demonstrated 31% positive, 41% neutral, and 28% negative sentiment. The firm highlighted a striking lack of coverage from elite financial publications, with The Wall Street Journal publishing just two Bitcoin articles, the Financial Times 11, and The New York Times 11. This is despite the fact that Bitcoin emerged as the best-performing asset of the past decade and saw billions added to corporate treasuries alongside record ETF volumes. Filling The Gap The report revealed that high-volume financial media such as Forbes, CNBC, and Barron’s provided extensive coverage and created a visible gap in narratives. Forbes, for instance, published 194 articles with 43% positive sentiment, particularly on retail and institutional adoption, with Bitcoin-related mining stories receiving 71.4% positive sentiment. CNBC published 141 articles with 42% positive sentiment, and highlighted Bitcoin’s role in banking, finance, and investment vehicles. Bitcoin Perception describes this coverage to be aligned with market developments rather than “institutional orthodoxy.” Meanwhile, Fortune published 117 articles with a balanced sentiment of 25% positive and 18% negative, and has maintained skepticism while covering Bitcoin’s growing role in the market. Barron’s published 65 articles with sentiment nearly split at 25% positive and 27% negative, showing a notable difference from its parent WSJ’s low volume. On the other hand, traditional news outlets such as The Independent and Fox News published 45 and 32 Bitcoin articles, respectively, maintaining a predominantly negative stance while still acknowledging Bitcoin’s relevance. The Independent recorded 42% negative sentiment, especially within crime, legal, and cybersecurity reporting, while Fox News maintained a conflicted narrative with 38% negative sentiment across similar topics. Ostrich Strategy Bitcoin Perception argued that the limited coverage from elite financial media reflects institutional reluctance rather than Bitcoin’s legitimacy issues, and framed this as an “ostrich strategy” that creates information asymmetry for institutional investors depending on these outlets for market intelligence. The report states that while the WSJ and FT provided minimal coverage of Bitcoin, other outlets documented significant developments in the digital asset economy. In the process, these outlets effectively replaced traditional financial media in informing investors about a key asset class. The disparity in coverage and sentiment, according to the report, indicates that as Bitcoin continues to outperform traditional assets, the “willful blindness” of elite financial publications contrasts sharply with the constructive, high-volume reporting from outlets like Forbes and CNBC, presenting both risks and opportunities for institutional positioning in the digital asset market.

2025-07-12T17:54:18,"Wall Street Firm Abruptly Upgrades JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, Says Upside Scenario Now Base Case for Big Banks","Boutique investment bank KBW believes JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are primed to witness higher prices as conditions conspire to favor large US banks In a new interview on CNBC Television, KBW head of US bank research Chris McGratty says the firm has upgraded its ratings for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley to outperform, with price targets of $327 for JPM and $160 for MS. According to McGratty, large banks are poised to benefit from easing regulations due to their scale-driven efficiency and consistent performance. “You are seeing a re-rating. This re-rating has been occurring for the past couple of months. Deregulation is being built into earnings estimate upside scenarios, blue skies, and the reality is that the upside scenario is becoming the base-case scenario. So you’re seeing the universal, the largest six banks, lead the charge. We’ve gotten a lot of positive news on deregulation, and that’s one of three themes with this launch is deregulation. The other two themes are scale and consistency, and any way you check it, the largest banks have all three under the relative winners.” As of Friday’s close, JPM is trading at $286 and MS is worth $142. Another banking giant on McGratty’s radar is Citi (C). McGratty says Citi may be the most undervalued stock among the group based on its return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a financial metric that measures how efficiently a bank is generating profits for its common shareholders. “If you think about their guide, their 10-11% ROTCE guide for next year, they took that down earlier this year. So the bar has been lowered. But if you look at where expectations are, we’re in the low to mid-9%. So there’s a big gap between low 9% and 10 to 11%. So if they can get that right, it’s the cheapest stock in the group. They’ve got a buyback catalyst. It’s very accretive when you can buy your stock back below 10 to a book value. And so this deregulatory environment for Citi is hugely helpful. The reason the ROE (return on equity) is so low is that the expenses have had to play catch-up. That investment phase is done, and so what the company is doing now is they are generating revenue. They are generating positive operating leverage across their businesses, and if they can get the macro to settle in a bit, this is a company I think we can re-rate quite a bit.” KBW is a New York-based firm known for its deep expertise in financials and bank stock coverage.

2025-07-12T17:48:24,"JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup Holding $172,280,000,000 in Unrealized Losses As Bank Bond Portfolios Remain Underwater: S&P Global","The four largest banks in the US are staring at tens of billions of dollars in unrealized losses on their held-to-maturity (HTM) securities as bond portfolios remain in the red. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, according to S&P Global, together hold $172.28 billion in unrealized losses on their HTM securities as of March 31st. The high interest rate environment is weighing heavily on the value of the HTM securities and the downward trend in the value of the banks’ investments in these assets is unlikely to change soon, the financial data firm says. Bank of America had the highest level of unrealized losses on HTM securities at $96.35 billion, followed by Wells Fargo at $37.82 billion. JPMorgan Chase’s unrealized losses on HTM securities stood at $22.91 billion while Citigroup’s were at $15.2 billion. Among the Big Four lenders, Bank of America recorded the lowest decline year-over-year in the value of its HTM assets – a 6.2% decrease to $550.76 billion. “JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported the biggest year-over-year decline in HTM securities of 20.8% to $265.17 billion while Citigroup Inc. led with the biggest quarterly decline of 9.1% to $220.51 billion as of March 31. Wells Fargo saw a 12.2% decline year-over-year in its HTM securities balances.” The unrealized losses on HTM assets by the Big Four are emblematic of the industry, according to S&P Global. “Banks continue to sit on unrealized losses tied to bonds they purchased when institutions were flush with excess liquidity and interest rates were far lower. Increases in interest rates punished the values of many bonds that banks held while their funding costs moved higher, putting pressure on their net interest margins.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-12T17:42:55,"Bank of America named Bitcoin the top-performing currency of 2025","Bitcoin blew past $120,000, and now Bank of America has officially declared it the best-performing currency of 2025. This update came straight from their latest report, Winners and Losers of 2025 , which put the crypto ahead of every fiat currency out there. The bank said Bitcoin has gained 18.2% since the start of the year, outperforming major players like the Swedish krona at +16.4%, the Swiss franc at +14.2%, and the euro, which came in at +13.2%. Meanwhile, the US dollar dropped 10.1%, landing dead last among the 14 asset classes they tracked. Bitcoin’s RSI rises, dollar crumbles This recognition came after months of steady gains that started building in early June. Price climbed from the $100,000 range and didn’t look back. Bitcoin surged above its 50-day exponential moving average, now at $106,434, breaking through key levels with real strength. Trading volume jumped at the same time, confirming what anyone watching the charts already knew, this wasn’t a weak rally. It was backed by actual momentum. The bank also flagged that Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) rose to 73.56, which signals overbought conditions. The last time RSI hit that level was in late May, when price hovered just under $110,000. Since then, it’s kept climbing. The structure on the charts shows higher highs and higher lows, and the fact that volume increased during the breakout gives it even more credibility. As of now, it’s sitting at the top of its historical range. As Bitcoin gained traction, traditional currencies struggled. Analysts at the bank blamed the dollar’s drop on weakening demand for dollar-based assets and growing doubts around where global interest rates are headed under the current administration. Investors are looking elsewhere, and Bitcoin has stepped in to fill that space. Bank adds list of undervalued stocks Outside of currencies, Bank of America pointed to several buy-rated stocks that they say have room to run. That includes Disney, Oddity Tech, Bellring Brands, AT&T, and Primo Brands. These companies showed enough upside, according to the analysts, to be listed alongside top-performing assets. Michael Funk, an analyst at the bank, brought AT&T back into coverage this week. He said, “Given the operational momentum in the business, strong combination of wireless and fiber assets and targeted return of capital over the next many years, we believe T should trade more closely to TMUS than VZ.” Michael thinks the company is “fundamentally sound, with a stable subscription-based business model.” AT&T shares are already up 19% this year. Yasmine Deswandhy, who covers Bellring Brands, said, “We believe the current share price undervalues BRBR’s historical sales growth delivery and potential runway.” She pointed to continued strength in health food trends, even with growing competition. “In our view, increased competition and recent changes in retailer buying teams are only natural in a young category and necessary for the category to expand out of the fringes and into the mainstream.” Despite being down 23% this year, she called the brand “built for endurance.” On Disney, analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote, “It appears now Experiences is tracking at least in line with FY25 expectations with the benefit of a robust pipeline of new cruise ships, which should buoy results in the years to come.” Jessica said short-term growth will likely come from a more profitable streaming business, better numbers from theme parks, and a film slate strong enough to drive other units. Disney stock is up 8% year-to-date. Primo Brands was included because of what analysts described as a strong consumer movement toward bottled water. The team gave it a Buy rating, saying the company is benefiting from favorable long-term demand and short-term synergy gains that help grow EBITDA. Finally, Oddity Tech stood out for its edge in tech. Analysts said, “We see opportunity for ODD to use its enhanced technological capabilities to capture share from legacy players.” The report mentioned 20%+ annual sales growth, with more growth expected from two new brand launches set for 2025 and 2026, aimed at expanding their reach to newer customers.

2025-07-12T17:12:45,"Trump’s 30% Tariffs on EU and Mexico Shake Bitcoin’s Bull Run","President Donald Trump’s latest tariff move is shaking up the Bitcoin and broader crypto market. After announcing a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union (EU) and Mexico, Bitcoin’s price took a sharp hit, falling below $118,000. The sudden drop came just after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high . This shows how quickly markets can react to global politics and trade news. It also raises worries that a new trade war could affect global markets and investor confidence. Crypto Market Turns Bearish After Trump’s Tariff News Goes Public Many posts on Truth Social say President Trump has sent official letters to the EU and Mexico. In the letters, he announced a new 30% tariff on goods coming into the U.S. from both regions. The tariffs will start on August 1 and are part of a larger trade plan already affecting other U.S. trading partners. The news quickly shook the crypto market. Before the announcement, Bitcoin had reached a new high of $118,200. However, soon after, the price dropped sharply. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,457, down by 0.40% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Analysts who were initially confident about a strong rise now think the top coin could keep falling as the market reacts. U.S Tariff Moves Continue to Pressure Bitcoin This is not the first time the crypto market has responded to Trump’s trade decisions. On July 7, he imposed 25% tariffs on imports from South Korea and Japan. He also sent tariff letters to 12 additional countries, each with different rates. That same day, Bitcoin fell below $108,000 before quickly rising again. By July 10, the digital coin had recovered and hit a new record above $112,000. The upward trend continued for a few more days, reaching $118,800 before dropping again due to the latest tariff news. Tariff Fears Could Trigger Broader Trade War While Bitcoin has shown resilience in recent weeks, Trump’s aggressive trade stance is creating uncertainty. The president warned that if other countries respond by raising tariffs on American goods, the U.S. will retaliate. Also, if the affected countries retaliate with their tariff hikes, the U.S. will respond with further measures. This growing tension raises concerns about a possible trade war, which could have far-reaching effects on both traditional and digital markets. Some investors are still confident in Bitcoin’s potential as a safe haven during global uncertainty. However, others worry that an economic slowdown and risk-off sentiment could push crypto prices down in the short term.

2025-07-12T16:57:28,"DWF Ventures Analyzes USDT’s Prospects of Dominating Competitive Stablecoin Market","Dubai, UAE, July 12th, 2025, Chainwire DWF Ventures, the venture arm of web3 investor and market maker DWF Labs, has released a comprehensive report exploring the future of stablecoins, with a spotlight on Tether's USDT and scaling solutions like Plasma and Stable. The analysis delves into the current state of stablecoins and how new purpose-built chains are poised to enhance USDT's global adoption by addressing compliance and scalability issues. In its stablecoin analysis, delivered in the form of an X thread, DWF Ventures examines the evolution of stablecoins, from synthetic dollars to digital payment solutions powering over $27 trillion in transfer volume, surpassing giants like Visa and Mastercard. It highlights how stablecoins now support use cases such as inflation hedging, global payroll, remittances, and consumer fintech. The report assesses the US Treasury Secretary's expectation of a $2 trillion stablecoin market by 2028, alongside recent milestones like Circle's IPO and the GENIUS Act. However, DWF Ventures identifies key inefficiencies in the current stablecoin ecosystem, including liquidity fragmentation across chains, lack of transparency, complex fiat ramps, and vulnerability to regulatory shifts. Issuers and adopters face chain dependency risks, volatile fees, and optimization gaps, particularly as over 80% of transactions occur on Tron and Ethereum. Tether dominates with a 62% market share and commensurate revenue, with USDT and Circle’s USDC accounting for 83% of transactions. This dominance has spurred new projects like Stable and Plasma, both backed by Tether, to optimize USDT for broader use cases such as payments, remittances, and enterprise DeFi. Stable is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 designed exclusively for stablecoins, featuring zero gas fees on USDT transfers and native USDT gas payments, DWF Ventures notes, making it the first standalone L1 to enable this. It unlocks low-cost scalability through features like bridging via LayerZero, native liquidity on Stable L1, built-in institutional compliance tools, off-chain sequencing, and a private mempool for enterprises. Plasma, an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain focused on stablecoins, has already hit a $1 billion deposit cap amid buzz around its upcoming XPL public sale. It emphasizes enabling scalable onchain merchant payments, remittances, commodity trading, and yields on stablecoins and Bitcoin. Key features include gas fees paid in whitelisted tokens with zero fees for USDT transfers, optional privacy via ZK or mixer protocols, and performance of up to 2K TPS with low latency. The report compares these solutions against Tron, highlighting shared traits such as the ability for USDT to serve as a native gas token as well as the availability of protocol-level compliance, but notes distinctions in network types, consensus mechanisms, and privacy features. While Tron excels in cross-chain bridging, high DeFi activity, and community governance, Stable prioritizes enterprise tools, and Plasma offers optional privacy and Bitcoin integration. DWF Ventures warns of ongoing challenges, including regulatory uncertainties and the need for better infrastructure to scale stablecoins into a foundational financial system. Yet it remains bullish, viewing Plasma and Stable not as replacements for USDT but as upgrades for faster and compliant global adoption. The analysis concludes: “Stablecoins as a whole aren’t just growing, they are forming and becoming the foundation for a new financial system.” DWF Ventures anticipates continued stablecoin growth and innovation and invites builders to connect for potential investments.

2025-07-12T16:55:14,"Florida Attorney General Probing Retail Trading Giant Robinhood for Allegedly Claiming To Be the Least Expensive Crypto Platform","Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has launched an investigation into Robinhood over allegations that the retail trading giant falsely promotes its crypto platform as the least expensive way to purchase digital assets. Uthmeier notes that Robinhood earns revenue by routing customers’ trades to third-party market makers in a payment-for-order-flow (PFOF) system. The state attorney general says Robinhood attracts customers by claiming to offer the “lowest cost on average” to trade crypto. Uthmeier argues, however, that Robinhood’s PFOF structure actually makes it more expensive than competing platforms that offer all-in trading costs. “When consumers buy and sell crypto assets, they deserve transparency in their transactions. Robinhood has long claimed to be the best bargain, but we believe those representations were deceptive.” The attorney general says third-party market makers that pay Robinhood for order flow sometimes have to charge worse prices to be profitable. Uthmeier issued a subpoena, asking Robinhood for organizational documents, employee information, advertising history, disclosures made to users related to fees, pricing documents, PFOF information, documents related to the sale of customer data, and information regarding Florida users specifically. Robinhood’s crypto division is required to respond to the subpoena by the end of the month, according to the attorney general.

2025-07-12T16:48:14,"Another BTC Mining Firm Moves Into Ethereum Reserve, Hailing ETH as ‘Digital Gold’","Bitcoin mining firm, BTC Digital (BTCT), has moved $1 million of company cash into ether (ETH), which it called its new “digital gold.” BTCT Moved $1M Into Ethereum Reserve, chief executive officer Siguang Peng said in a press release, adding that Ethereum has “emerged as the foundation of on-chain USD settlement and value transfer.” ""By securing an initial $1 million ETH reserve today—and with plans to scale that position—we are proactively positioning ourselves for decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and asset tokenization,” Peng said. BTCT plans to grow the reserve as upgrades lift capacity and U.S. rules solidify. BTC Digital was previously a bitcoin mining company. The firm recently said that ""its 20 MW large–scale cryptocurrency mining project in Georgia has reached a significant milestone."" The company doesn't state if it still plans to mine bitcoin, but said it is ""building on its origins in large–scale crypto mining, BTCT is undergoing a strategic evolution from ""hash–rate provider"" to ""on–chain financial infrastructure participant,"" in the press release. BTC Digital is the second publicly traded bitcoin miner turning to an ether treasury. Earlier this month Bit Digital (BTBT) shifted its entire treasury from BTC to ETH as it moved to a staking strategy. The move saw its stock jump up to 30%. It has since corrected in a nearly 20% drop. Meanwhile, BTCT's stock closed Friday's trading session 13% higher. Publicly-known ether treasuries, which include the treasuries of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Layer-2 networks, and publicly-traded firms, currently hold more than 1.34 million ETH, according to a public tracker.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/12/another-btc-mining-firm-moves-into-ethereum-reserve-hailing-eth-as-digital-gold,"ETH|BTC|FIAT|MINING|SPONSORED","Markets|Ether|Ethereum Treasury|Bitcoin Mining|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T16:12:00,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Two Consecutive $1B+ Inflow Days for First Time","US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded over $1 billion in inflows for two straight days, a first since their launch in January 2024. Key Takeaways: US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $1 billion in inflows for two consecutive days for the first time. BlackRock’s IBIT dominated Friday’s inflows with $953 million. Analysts warn that such high inflows may not be sustainable at current Bitcoin price levels. On Friday, 11 spot Bitcoin ETF products reported combined inflows totaling $1.03 billion, following $1.17 billion the previous day, according to Farside data . BlackRock’s IBIT accounted for the lion’s share of the inflows, attracting over $953 million on Friday. Only Seven Days of $1 Billion+ Inflows Recorded Since ETF Launch Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, noted in an X post that since the launch of these ETFs, there have been only seven days with inflows exceeding $1 billion. Notably, two of those occurred in the last two days. The previous high was $1.07 billion on January 17, 2024. The $1.17 billion inflow on Thursday was the second-largest daily figure since inception, surpassed only by the $1.37 billion inflow on November 7, 2024, the day of Donald Trump’s US presidential election victory. Matt Hougan, Bitwise Invest’s chief investment officer, highlighted that while the Bitcoin network produced roughly 450 BTC on Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs bought about 10,000 BTC. Similarly, blockchain analytics firm Jan3 noted that on Wednesday, Bitcoin ETF demand was 22 times greater than the daily mined supply. However, Jan3 CEO Samson Mow cautioned that such demand is unlikely to be sustainable at current price levels. This demand is not sustainable at these price levels. https://t.co/JkzZVPFo08 — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 11, 2025 The strong demand contributed to $2.72 billion in inflows over the past five trading days. Bitcoin’s price surged to new all-time highs, reaching $112,000 on Wednesday and climbing further to $118,780 on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. The price rally helped BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) surpass $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) on Thursday. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called it the “fastest ETF” to reach this milestone, achieving it in just 374 days. Recently, BlackRock reported earning more revenue from IBIT than from its flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. Balchunas added that total assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed $140 billion for the first time, largely driven by the recent price surge. As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. Institutional Bitcoin Demand Shifts From ETFs to Corporate Treasuries Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. Japan’s Metaplanet recently bought $237 million worth of BTC , becoming the fifth-largest corporate holder with a stack exceeding 15,500 BTC. France’s The Blockchain Group and the UK’s Smarter Web Company also made new BTC treasury allocations this week, purchasing $12.5 million and $24.3 million worth of Bitcoin respectively. Remixpoint, a Tokyo-listed firm, raised $215 million to fund a planned accumulation of 3,000 BTC.

2025-07-12T16:02:50,"ETH hitting $3k ignites alt season sentiments","Ethereum treasury company Sharplink Gaming has acquired another 21,487 ETH worth $64.24 million. The company bought the ETH in over-the-counter (OTC) deals within six hours through Galaxy Digital and Coinbase Prime. This follows its recent purchase of 10,000 ETH from the Ethereum Foundation for more $25 million through an OTC deal, continuing the company’s buying spree. According to crypto analyst Ember CN , the firm has 253,000 ETH with an average purchase price of $2,647. Sharplink, a gaming company, before it pivoted to crypto by establishing an Ethereum Treasury in early June, has Consensys Chairman and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin as its chairman. Although the company initially raised around $425 million to buy ETH, it has already spent over $600 million on acquiring Ethereum in less than two months, contributing significantly to buying pressure around the asset. Its decision to adopt the ETH treasury could not have come at a better time, with the asset seeing sizable gains over the past few weeks, enough to make the Sharplink portfolio turn profitable. With ETH gaining 17.75% in the last seven days and briefly crossing $3,000 for the first time since February 2025 before dropping to the $2,900 range, the company is now sitting on unrealized profits. Per Ember_CN, the firm has over $79 million in profits at the current ETH price. Sharplink stock outperforms ETH since the first acquisition Even more interesting is how Sharplink (SBET) has been performing relative to ETH since the company adopted the ETH treasury. According to CryptoQuant , SBET is up 486% since Sharplink first invested in ETH. By comparison, ETH has only been 17% since then. Sharplink stock value has quadrupled since adopting ETH Treasury (Source: CryptoQuant) Interestingly, this is not unique to Sharplink and ETH. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) stock MSTR has performed relatively better than Bitcoin. According to Yahoo Finance data, BTC is up only 24.75% this year while MSTR is up 44.86%. Unsurprisingly, the company stock is trading at a premium to the ETH it holds. With a market cap of $1.55 billion, the value of ETH backing each SBET stock based on its current ETH holdings is only 0.00353 ETH, worth around $10.40 at current prices. This is far below the $21.5 share value. However, the recent gains of Sharplink stock are a welcome development given that the shares are still trading far below their peak. SBET peaked in May at $124 and has fallen significantly since then, with its registration of shares filing a few months ago even part of the factors contributing to that decline. Meanwhile, the company is now the largest holder of ETH after its latest purchase, which took it above the Ethereum Foundation holdings of 242,489 ETH. ETH hitting $3k ignites alt season sentiments The $3,000 mark represents a significant price level for Ethereum, both psychologically and financially. According to Santiment , 124.13 million of the total 155.04 million ETH in existence are at a higher price at this level than when they first originated. This means that 4 out of every 5 ETH tokens are in profit above $3,000. Meanwhile, many believe the altcoin season might be on the way, noting the sustained ETH performance over the past few weeks that has allowed the token to wipe off most of its losses this year. There were further signs of interest with ETH futures flipping that of BTC a few days ago, according to Glassnode data, with a 24-hour volume of $62.1 billion compared to the $61.7 billion. The drop in Bitcoin dominance from 66% to 64.5% has also contributed to this sentiment. ETH exchange-traded funds have also started attracting massive volume, with $1.10 billion in net inflows into the products in July. The month is now on track to become the second-best month for ETH ETFs since its launch in 2024 and is already third, only a few hundred million behind June 2025, which had $1.16 billion, and over a billion behind December 2024 with $2.08 billion.

2025-07-12T15:49:07,"Number of XRP Whales at All-Time High, Ethereum Whales at Threshold Not Seen Since 2017 – What’s Happening? Here’s What Analysts Say","Cryptocurrency analysis firm Santiment released a compelling analysis of market dynamics in its latest report. Warnings range from Ethereum whales to the memecoin craze, from XRP volatility to signals of altcoin season. According to data from Santiment, large wallets holding more than 10,000 ETH hold 75.74% of the Ethereum supply, the highest level since May 2017. The company considers this increase a long-term bullish signal. While Bitcoin remains in the headlines, Ethereum is quietly gaining attention as it approaches the $3,000 mark. Social media optimism surrounding ETH is high. However, Santiment analyst Brian warns that this overwhelming positive sentiment could be counterproductive in the short term. Related News: Big Crypto Whales Make Big Trades as the Market Rises - Here's What They Trade According to the analytics firm's report, memecoins were the cryptocurrency sector that rose the most last week. Brian highlighted this area, which led the way with an average increase of 17%, arguing that this could be a sign of market saturation and a potential peak approach. According to Santiment, the number of wallets holding one million XRP or more has reached an all-time high of 2,743. At the same time, the total amount of XRP held by these whales is also increasing. This double-edged surge is considered a strong bullish signal for XRP. Santiment's data reveals that many altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. However, the sustainability of this trend depends on Bitcoin's stability above the $110,000 level, which the company stated is a critical threshold for the altcoin market. While the week ended on a strong note, the next few days will be the true test of the market. Analysts predict Monday, in particular, will reveal whether the crypto market can maintain its momentum. *This is not investment advice.
