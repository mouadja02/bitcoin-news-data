2025-07-12T07:54:19,"Google Gemini Sets Bitcoin Price for July 31, 2025","Bitcoin is demonstrating significant strength in July 2025, with market dynamics signaling continued upward movement as the month progresses. Currently priced at $117,430, the asset has gained 5% in the past 24 hours and 9% over the past week, reflecting growing investor confidence. While numerous analysts have offered varied projections, Google’s AI platform Gemini has added its voice to the broader conversation around Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Post-Tariff Rally Begins with “Liberation Day” Much of the current momentum in Bitcoin’s price can be traced back to early April, when a major geopolitical and economic development changed investor behavior. On April 2, President Donald Trump declared what he called “Liberation Day,” a sweeping policy shift involving an aggressive package of tariffs aimed at rebalancing global trade. This announcement initially triggered a downturn in traditional stock markets. However, Bitcoin moved in the opposite direction, climbing from around $70,000 to its present range. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Boosts Institutional Confidence One of the most consequential actions that followed Liberation Day was President Trump’s executive order to establish a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Describing it as a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold, the president outlined the need for a sovereign digital asset buffer in an increasingly uncertain financial world. This historic decision marked the first formal effort by the United States to incorporate Bitcoin into its national reserve strategy, signaling to the global market that the asset was now being viewed through a national security and long-term value lens. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bitcoin’s Supply Structure Reinforces Store-of-Value Status These policy moves have coincided with heightened interest from institutional investors, many of whom now view Bitcoin not only as a hedge against inflation but also as a geopolitical asset. Bitcoin’s unique structure, particularly its limited supply of 21 million coins, has always invited comparisons to gold. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be expanded at will by central banks, Bitcoin’s fixed issuance model ensures scarcity, a quality that becomes attractive in times of economic volatility or strategic financial repositioning. Google Gemini Forecasts Bitcoin to Hit $120,000 by Month-End As market participants adjust to these developments, Google Gemini has analyzed the underlying data and market indicators to offer a short-term forecast. According to its assessment, Bitcoin is expected to reach approximately $120,000 by July 31, 2025, representing a 2.1% increase from current levels. Gemini stated: “Based on current momentum and macroeconomic catalysts, Bitcoin is on track to climb approximately 2.1% to $120,000 by July 31.” This projection is grounded in a synthesis of price trends, supply-demand mechanics, and the broader policy environment. With less than three weeks until the end of the month, market observers are paying close attention to how Bitcoin performs relative to Gemini’s forecast.

2025-07-12T07:40:09,"Are Binance Founder CZ and Donald Trump in an Alliance? Here are the Allegations","Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has been revealed to be providing behind-the-scenes support to a crypto venture owned by the Trump family, according to Bloomberg. This aid comes at a time when Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) is seeking clemency from US President Donald Trump. According to three sources familiar with the matter, Binance wrote the underlying software code for the stablecoin USD1, launched by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial Inc. This technical support includes developing the “smart contract” that governs the creation of USD1. This coin was used in the spring when a United Arab Emirates-based investment firm purchased a $2 billion stake in Binance. More than two months after this major transaction, approximately 90% of USD1 tokens in circulation are still held in Binance wallets, according to on-chain data. The interest income generated by these assets could generate tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue for the Trump family. Binance also introduced USD1 to its 275 million user base, a privilege often coveted by stablecoin issuers. Related News: Grayscale Sends Special Letter to SEC Regarding XRP, Solana, and Cardano ETFs - Here's What It Says So, publicly available data and testimony from people familiar with the situation suggest that Binance was directly involved in the creation, promotion, and largest-ever transaction of USD1. However, it remains unclear whether Binance or Zhao received any payment from the Trump family for this service. Binance's statement said USD1 had gone through the exchange's “standard listing process.” It emphasized that CZ was no longer CEO and that the amnesty application was a “personal decision.” Zhao did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment. A spokesperson for World Liberty declined to elaborate on the relationship with Binance, but said, “Your allegations are baseless and intended to feed a political agenda.” It's unclear how the companies first made contact. However, two sources familiar with the matter claimed that CZ met with Steve Witkoff, a Trump associate and co-founder of World Liberty, at a Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi in December. At the time, Zhao had just been released from federal custody after a short sentence for violating anti-money laundering regulations, while Binance had paid over $4 billion in fines to US authorities. A member of Witkoff's inner circle denied that the meeting took place. Witkoff, previously appointed as a diplomat by Trump, was reportedly in the process of transferring his shares in World Liberty to his sons. White House Counsel David Warrington stated that Witkoff managed this process in accordance with ethical rules. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-12T07:30:44,"SharpLink Buys 10,000 ETH From Ethereum Foundation — What Are They Planning?","Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming has expanded its Ethereum holdings through a direct over-the-counter transaction with the Ethereum Foundation. The company purchased 10,000 ETH for approximately $25.7 million, pricing each token at $2,572.37. The deal, finalized on July 10, increases SharpLink’s total ETH balance to 215,634 tokens, according to data from DeFiLlama. At current market value, that brings the firm’s treasury to an estimated $558 million, positioning it as one of the largest known institutional holders of ETH. The move reflects a deepening strategy from SharpLink, which has steadily shifted its balance sheet toward Ethereum since early June. According to the company, the ETH accumulation is not just a corporate treasury play, but a broader alignment with the ETH ecosystem. Funds for the acquisition reportedly came from at-the-market share sales, part of a $425 million private raise led by Consensys, the blockchain software company founded by SharpLink Chairman and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. Strategic ETH Acquisition Aims to Support DeFi Infrastructure SharpLink emphasized that the purchase is not only about balance sheet expansion but also a commitment to long-term support for Ethereum’s decentralization. In the statement, Lubin noted that the company is actively staking and restaking ETH in an effort to reduce circulating supply and contribute to the network’s health. “SharpLink is acquiring, staking, and restaking ETH as responsible industry stewards, removing supply from circulation and reinforcing the health of the Ethereum ecosystem,” he said. The transaction marks a rare instance of the Ethereum Foundation transferring such a large volume of ETH directly to a public company. While the foundation has made ETH sales in the past, often viewed as macro sentiment indicators, this direct transfer to a corporate buyer is unusual and may signal evolving relationships between crypto-native institutions and traditional capital markets. The ETH Foundation, based in Zug, Switzerland, plays a central role in supporting the development and research behind ETH’s protocol. Its ETH reserves are typically used to fund research grants, developer bounties, and infrastructure projects. The sale to SharpLink suggests that it is also exploring strategic partnerships to deepen Ethereum’s integration into regulated financial ecosystems. Corporate Crypto Allocation Trends Continue to Shift SharpLink’s ETH-heavy treasury strategy follows a broader pattern of increasing institutional interest in digital assets beyond Bitcoin. While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused balance sheet has dominated headlines, SharpLink’s growing Ethereum position illustrates expanding diversification among public firms in the crypto space. As more institutions evaluate on-chain assets not just for speculation but as foundational infrastructure, Ethereum appears to be gaining traction. The firm’s activity may also reflect broader investor behavior amid ETH’s growing role in DeFi. With staking yields, Layer 2 adoption, and real-world asset tokenization narratives on the rise, ETH’s appeal to corporations seeking exposure to blockchain-based finance continues to evolve.

2025-07-12T07:30:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Climbs But Eyes Are On This DeFi Coin That Could Explode 40x","As Bitcoin (BTC) makes modest gains and reclaims investor attention with its latest price climb, the real buzz is building around a lesser-known but rapidly emerging player in the DeFi ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 65% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $12.1 million has already been raised, with a total of more than 13,100 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on investments made in Phase 5. While BTC’s momentum signals strength in the broader crypto market, analysts and insiders are zeroing in on Mutuum Finance. Bitcoin Reclaims Momentum Amid ETF and Macro Tailwinds Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to roughly $118,016, setting fresh highs in response to substantial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, declining on‑exchange supply, and growing investor optimism around potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts slated for September. Bolstered by upbeat institutional sentiment and regulatory clarity, including a strategic U.S. crypto reserve, the leading digital asset has reclaimed all‑time high territory and is eyeing a move toward the $120,000 level. With on‑chain metrics pointing to record low liquid supply, analysts suggest Bitcoin may continue its ascent into August. Amid this backdrop, sector watchers remain alert to emerging DeFi protocols, such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Reaches $12.1M Milestone in Presale The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13100 investors and has raised more than $12.1 million. Investors have picked up more than 65% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Starts Major Token Giveaway Event Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of $10,000 in MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded under its newly introduced leaderboard system. As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. How Mutuum Finance Is Transforming Lending in DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets. It is a workable multifunctional double-lending system, which incorporates the synergy of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, lending pools are utilized via smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like meme coins. While Bitcoin (BTC) continues its upward momentum, climbing past $118,000 amid ETF inflows and macro tailwinds, the real breakout potential may lie in the DeFi sector, where Mutuum Finance is gaining serious traction. With over $12.1 million raised and more than 13,100 early investors, Mutuum’s Phase 5 presale is already 65% sold out at a price of $0.03, offering investors a 100% ROI at listing. As excitement builds ahead of Phase 6, analysts are projecting a potential 40x upside by year-end, thanks to Mutuum’s innovative dual lending model and fully audited smart contracts. Secure your tokens now before Phase 5 closes, and claim your share of the $100,000 token giveaway.

2025-07-12T07:08:56,"Wall Street Bets Big — $3.6B Pours Into Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs Weekly","The demand for cryptocurrency on Wall Street is more than evident, and the past week only proved that narrative. The ETFs tracking the performance of the two largest digital assets recorded a highly impressive five-day trading period, attracting billions of dollars in total. In the meantime, the prices of both skyrocketed to a multi-month and an all-time high. Bitcoin ETFs See Over $2.5B in Net Inflows Let’s begin with the most impressive numbers, which came in the last two trading days of the week. Data from FarSide shows that Thursday saw the biggest new inflow day since early November and the second-largest in the 18-month history of the funds. $1,175.6 billion went into the financial vehicles, which were distributed somewhat evenly between three of the biggest – $448.5 million into BlackRock’s IBIT, $324.3 million into Fidelity’s FBTC, and $268.7 million into Ark Invest’s ARKB. Friday was almost as impressive, with $1,029.6 billion entering the funds. This time, though, IBIT dwarfed its competition, attracting $953.5 million. ARKB, which was second, was far, far behind, with a modest $23.5 million in net inflows. Adding the $215.7 million witnessed on Wednesday, $80.1 million on Tuesday, and $216.5 million on Monday, the total for the week stands at $2,717.5 billion. Somewhat expected, these mindblowing numbers affected the underlying asset’s price, which surged by over $10,000 to a new all-time high of almost $119,000 on Friday. What’s perhaps even more impressive is that all Bitcoin ETFs have seen only one negative day (July 1) since June 9. ETH ETFs Impress, Too The spot Ethereum ETFs , which are close to celebrating their first year in existence, have also become a lot more favorable among investors in the past few months. Moreover, they set a record in terms of daily inflows on Thursday, as reported , when $383.1 million entered the funds. Friday and Wednesday were also impressive in this regard, albeit in a more modest manner, with $204.9 million and $211.3 million going into the financial vehicles, respectively. On Monday and Tuesday, investors allocated $62.1 million and $46.7 million into the ETFs, bringing the total for the week to $908.1 million, according to data from FarSide. BlackRock’s ETHA has dominated the landscape once again, gaining over $300 million out of the $383.1 million on Thursday and $137.1 million out of the $204.9 million on Friday. ETH’s price has also benefited from the substantial interest in the Ethereum ETFs, shooting up this week from $2,500 on Wednesday to a multi-month high of its own at $3,040 on Friday. It has retraced slightly to just under $3,000 now, but it’s still up by over 17% on a weekly scale. In total, the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs attracted more than $3.6 billion in one week alone.

John Marshall, Goldman’s head of derivatives research, says in a new interview with CNBC that the brokerages Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) are benefiting from a surge in retail trading activity, which could boost their stock prices. “The retail activity – while they may not have been buying intensely over the last couple of months, they’ve been very active, and that should be a tailwind for both of them.” Marshall also says Goldman believes the equipment and machinery giant John Deere (DE) could benefit from the agricultural cycle, which the firm believes is at a cyclical bottom. Goldman Sachs’ other tactical trades related to Q2 earnings reports include the cloud-based data storage firm Snowflake (SNOW), the aircraft leasing company Air Lease Corporation (AL), the restaurant franchise giant YUM! (YUM) and the global branded food company Hormel Foods (HRL). In terms of stocks that could slide in price due to earnings reports, Marshall mentions the furniture giant Restoration Hardware (RH). “While they don’t report until September, that’s a name which has tough compares.” Other stocks that Goldman thinks could have potential downside include the airline giant Southwest (LUV) and the Boston Beer Company (SAM).

Trading volumes surged past 1.1B during the 13:00–15:00 session, establishing resistance between $0.208–$0.213. Support held at $0.200–$0.201 through late-session volatility, with final hour price action stabilizing around $0.202. Analysts flagged the rejection at $0.211 (20:00) as evidence of systematic profit-taking by larger holders. News Background: BTC Record, Risk-On Flows Drive Meme Coin Rally Bitcoin touched an all-time high of $118,000 during the session, as crypto markets benefited from a surge in institutional inflows — estimated at $50B this week alone. Easing geopolitical tensions, improving trade relations, and dovish signals from central banks have boosted risk assets across the board. Dogecoin, typically a high-beta play during crypto rallies, surged alongside altcoins in response.

Breakdown below $0.198–$0.200 would signal trend exhaustion Consolidation above $0.202 would support a bullish continuation setup into next week Broader BTC and macro risk sentiment will continue to dictate altcoin flows Takeaway DOGE followed broader crypto markets higher with a clean intraday breakout — but its rejection at $0.213 and sharp pullback highlight the fragile nature of meme coin rallies during high volatility sessions. Institutional flows remain, but traders should watch for volume confirmation before chasing upside. $0.200 is now the line in the sand.

2025-07-12T06:48:24,"Expert Explains Why XRP Is More Powerful Than Direct Connections","An intriguing post by financial expert Jake Claver has offered a fresh take on XRP’s core utility. Claver emphasized that “XRP doesn’t compete in many currency pair battles. Instead, it pools all liquidity into one central point.” This framing highlights a design where XRP acts as a unified bridge asset rather than a token tied to individual trading pairs. XRP doesn’t compete in many currency pair battles. Instead, it pools all liquidity into one central point. This makes XRP much more powerful than any single direct connection. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) July 10, 2025 Claver’s comment draws attention to XRP’s structural advantage in liquidity sourcing. Meanwhile, Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, had detailed how the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) auto‑bridge feature ensures XRP acts as a central intermediary , optimizing transactions between tokens and reinforcing its liquidity role on the ledger. This mechanism supports growing volumes of tokenized assets, translating into higher XRP usage for both fees and liquidity provision. XRP’s Growing Adoption and Infrastructure Over the longer horizon, the structural liquidity model Claver describes supports broader industry trends. Ripple has seen rapid adoption of its XRP-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product and a notable increase in partnerships, currently working with hundreds of financial institutions. The ODL system uses XRP to settle cross‑border transfers without requiring banks to maintain pre-funded accounts, and this innovation reduces cost and latency in global payments, making XRP a preferred option for cross-border payments. Additionally, XRP’s role is not sidelined by new stablecoin products like RLUSD. While one commenter expressed this concern, Schwartz has previously clarified that RLUSD enhances XRP’s function by introducing alternative settlement paths without reducing XRP’s bridging utility. Higher volumes of tokenized assets on XRPL also help the ecosystem, as it leads to escalating demand for XRP for transaction fees and liquidity. This dynamic affirms XRP as integral to the ledger’s long-term economic model. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX), automated market maker (AMM), and other features gain traction, the digital asset’s central role in enabling liquidity becomes more pronounced. Reactions Reflect Widespread Confidence Multiple community members responded enthusiastically to Claver’s post. Many echoed his assessment by highlighting XRP’s real‑world utility, contrasting it with assets that lack tangible use cases. One commenter shared excitement about XRP’s potential to outperform Bitcoin in practical applications, and another suggested that the asset could reach triple-digit targets by the end of the year. Others reaffirmed that Claver’s liquidity framing is consistent with XRP’s design and mission. XRP enjoys structural strengths often overlooked in speculative discourse, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has reaffirmed the importance of liquidity, predicting that it could capture 14% of SWIFT’s volume within 5 years by prioritizing liquidity provisioning.

2025-07-12T06:45:01,"Bitcoin Dumped for Ethereum: Bit Digital Bets $172M on ETH. Is This the End of Bitcoin Dominance?","A major shift in the crypto world has occurred. Bit Digital has made a massive $172 million move, favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin. This bold bet raises questions about the future of Bitcoin's leading position. What does this mean for the supremacy of cryptocurrencies? Could this signal a new era for other digital coins? The answers may surprise. Analysis powered by Outset PR , a blockchain PR agency that leverages data, trends, and market timing to empower Web3 leaders to maximize every opportunity. Bitcoin Price Flirts with New Highs: Bullish Momentum Builds Source: tradingview Bitcoin is showing strong movement, with prices hovering slightly above $107,000 to $111,000. It is just under a key resistance point at nearly $114,000. If Bitcoin breaks past this, it could aim for around $119,000, a potential jump of about 7%. With a six-month growth of almost 19%, Bitcoin’s upward momentum appears solid. Indicators like the RSI suggest high interest from buyers. The current pattern suggests further gains if Bitcoin maintains its pace and crosses resistance levels. Enthusiasts are hopeful even as cautious optimism prevails, as Bitcoin continues its climb, setting sights on breaking new records. Ethereum Surges: Can ETH Break Past $3000 Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price currently sits between $2420 and $2679, showing a positive trend with a 9.10% increase over the past week. Analysts highlight the nearest resistance level at $2787, which ETH might test soon. If it breaks through, the next target is $3047, promising a potential rise of about 14% from the current range. With the relative strength index near 68, ETH indicates strong momentum but is not overbought just yet. This suggests room for further growth. However, caution is advised as the nearest support at around $2269 could slow things down.

Here are some of the possible reasons behind this impressive price surge that drove XRP to almost $3. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Social Engagements and Network Activity CryptoPotato reported yesterday the notable price move north, which drove XRP from roughly $2.3 to just shy of $3 within a 36-to 48-hour period. Although it failed to go beyond $3 to challenge its January 2018 all-time high and has retraced slightly, the price surge helped XRP overtake USDT in terms of market cap. Some analysts predicted this development, ever warning that most traders would miss it. Santiment also weighed in on the matter, outlining its reasons behind the massive surge. The analytics company noted that this breakout transpired in times when the network behind the token saw an impressive growth, which is seen by the rising number of newly created wallets. More precisely, nearly 7,000 such new addresses were created within 24 hours. XRP has pumped to a high of $2.97 today, breaking out to a 4-month high. This is coinciding with a major increase in network growth (new wallets created) & rise in retail interest across social media. Track these metrics any time on this chart: https://t.co/pk1BSHPO8G pic.twitter.com/AD8sUSUfu6 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 11, 2025 Santiment’s second reason is related to the overall retail interest in the token across social media, where 5.5% of all crypto discussions centered around XRP. This was the highest level since mid-March when Ripple’s CEO announced the end of the prolonged legal battle between the company and the US SEC. Whales and Market Resurgence As XRP was just beginning its breakout, CryptoPotato reported another probable reason that could have driven the asset higher. At the time, the number of large wallets holding at least a million tokens had risen to an all-time high of 2,743 (and 2,742 on the next day). The last reason we will discuss in this article is the overall market resurgence. XRP was not the only cryptocurrency in a consolidation phase for weeks. Bitcoin, the market leader, was in a similar state despite some volatility experienced during the Israel-Iran war. However, it broke out on Wednesday evening and led the entire market into the promised land . After surging to a new all-time high of almost $119,000 on Friday, many altcoins followed suit, including XRP. Being the first, biggest, and arguably most important digital asset, BTC’s moves effect significantly the rest of the market.

2025-07-12T06:34:52,"Athur Hayes Predicts Ethereum’s Surge To $10,000 As ETH Soars Past $3,000","Ethereum (ETH) performed strongly this week, surging to a high of over $3000. Its rise comes as Bitcoin also hits its all-time high of $118,000 , which is a sign that the crypto market is gaining strong momentum with time. Notably, ETH has climbed back above the $3,000 mark for the first time since February, marking a strong recovery after a drop from $4,100 in December 2025 to a low of $1,387 in April. This rebound comes at a time when global markets remain unsettled by renewed tariff disputes and growing political uncertainty tied to former President Trump’s influence on economic policy. That said, Ethereum’s surge in price has raised various optimistic observations and predictions from analysts. In a post, Pentoshi, a popular crypto analyst, highlighted the shifting sentiment around Ethereum, noting that growing capital inflows, especially from public companies, could soon outweigh all ETH issued since the Merge. With Ethereum’s market cap still a fraction of Bitcoin’s, the analyst suggested it won’t take much to trigger significant price moves. He urged the community to put aside bias and recognize the momentum building behind ETH, calling its rise “inevitable” in hindsight. Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of the BitMEX platform, predicted that ETH would hit $10,000 following the ongoing surge. ‘‘ Arise Chikun, it’s time… ETH = $10,000 Yachtzee,’’ Arthur tweeted on Thursday, sharing the chart below Hayes further pointed out that Ethereum is steadily gaining ground against Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC trading pair slowly climbing from its historical lows. Elsewhere, market analyst XForceGlobal recently echoed similar views, predicting that Ethereum as an asset is on track to eventually reach the $10,000 milestone. He emphasized that growing institutional interest, improving fundamentals, and Ethereum’s evolving role in the blockchain ecosystem all support a long-term bullish outlook. “The move up on the shorter timeframes was objectively. ETH is still looking to shoot for a new ATH’s this cycle and should end around $9,000- $10,000, give or take.” XForceGlobal tweeted. No macro scenario is providing a ‘good look’ and remains only ideal in nature using context; however, this remains as my primary idea for now, ‘ Meanwhile, analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted that Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level around $3,500, with a potential breakout on the horizon if bullish momentum persists. He pointed to the growing impact of Ethereum ETFs that include staking features as a possible catalyst, emphasizing that these products could significantly reduce the circulating supply. The further pundit suggested that recent regulatory shifts, such as the SEC’s more favorable stance toward proof-of-stake assets, combined with staking demand, may create the ideal conditions for Ethereum to break past this key barrier. At press time, ETH is trading at $2,981.30, reflecting a 5.28% surge within the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/athur-hayes-predicts-ethereums-surge-to-10000-as-eth-soars-past-3000/,"ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION","Ethereum|Markets|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T06:25:39,"Why is XRP Price Up Today?","The post Why is XRP Price Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price has surged 26% this week, reaching $2.80, driven by a combination of powerful market catalysts. On-chain data reveals that whales now hold over 47 billion XRP, signaling strong institutional confidence. This accumulation, paired with a major short squeeze that liquidated millions in bearish bets, has intensified upward pressure. Additionally, growing speculation around a potential XRP spot ETF has fueled investor excitement, pushing the token closer to a breakout above $3 . What is Driving XRP Price Surge Today? Whale Accumulation Reaches New Peaks According to on-chain data from Santiment , the number of wallets holding over 1 million XRP has reached a record 2,743. These whales now control a combined 47.3 billion XRP. Santiment calls this trend a very positive sign for the fourth-largest crypto asset, reflecting deeper conviction among top-tier holders. Short Squeeze Pushes Price Higher As XRP pushed higher, nearly $31.4 million in short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours alone. With bears getting squeezed out, momentum accelerated. The coin’s open interest now stands at $7.2 billion, its highest in six months and inching closer to the January peak of $8.3 billion. That’s more than double the $3 billion low seen in April, according to CoinGlass . Altcoin Season Heats Up This XRP breakout mirrors broader market excitement. Bitcoin recently smashed records, topping $116,500, while Ethereum gained 17.5 percent on the week, trading near $2,960. Santiment confirms the altcoin season is underway, with traders rotating profits from Bitcoin into major altcoins like XRP. I mentioned that $2.70-$2.90 was the zone to watch out for. So now that $XRP had touched $2.97 and rejected off the 0.786 fib at $2.90, we should stall out for a while, retest the lower support levels before we finally send higher. Exciting times ahead! https://t.co/pydkpn86UI pic.twitter.com/w6XadTDDUk — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 12, 2025 XRP has gained nearly 7% over the past 30 days, steadily building strength since mid-June. It now ranks as the second-best performer this week after Ether. Recently, XRP surpassed a $170 billion market cap. Analysts believe that if XRP clears the $2.90 barrier, a move to $3 is likely. Despite its rally, XRP still trades 18% below its 2018 all-time high, which it nearly reclaimed in January. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Net Worth Climbs to $10B After SEC Settlement , Short and Long-Term Outlook In the near term, if momentum continues and XRP holds above $2.60–$2.65, analysts see $3 as an achievable target by August. Long term, a successful XRP ETF approval combined with sustained whale activity could push the token to $3.50–$4 by Q4 2025. With RSI near 66, technicals still leave room for upside. ETF Buzz Adds Fuel The SEC has fast-tracked ETF reviews, cutting wait times to just 75 days. Futures-based XRP ETFs are expected between July 14 and 25, but the real catalyst would be a spot ETF approval. If that happens, it could change everything for XRP’s future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Will XRP reach its all-time high this month? XRP’s all-time high is $3.40 (from January 2018). While it has shown strong momentum, some analysts predict it could reach $3.00 by August. A quick move to ATH in July is possible but depends on sustained bullish catalysts. How high can XRP’s price go in 2025? Analysts project XRP could reach $3.50-$4 by Q4 2025, especially with a spot ETF approval.

2025-07-12T06:21:30,"Analyst Says XRP Season Starts Now. Here’s why","XRP has recently moved above a critical resistance level against Bitcoin (BTC), a development that is now drawing serious attention among crypto traders. On the 4-hour timeframe, crypto analyst Alex Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) showed that XRP/BTC closed a strong candle above the longstanding horizontal resistance, marking what appears to be a confirmed breakout after weeks of coiling underneath the threshold. The resistance line had repeatedly rejected price advances, capping XRP’s relative strength against Bitcoin throughout multiple tests. But in the latest price action, the digital asset finally pushed through with consecutive closes above the level, supported by moderate volume. The clean structure and horizontal alignment of the breakout reinforce the technical significance of the move, especially within the context of a larger consolidation range that began forming months ago. Yep I’ve seen enough, XRP season starts now pic.twitter.com/zADad3OaIh — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) July 9, 2025 Cobb Declares XRP Season Cobb responded to the breakout with a confident statement: “Yep I’ve seen enough, XRP season starts now.” While brief, Cobb’s declaration speaks directly to the massive breakout that many traders have been anticipating . Cobb expects XRP to demonstrate relative strength across markets, turning the asset’s trajectory fully positive and possibly signaling renewed investor interest. His observation does not stem from speculation alone. Resistance has become support, and the asset is about to enter bullish territory . What to Expect From XRP This breakout changes the dynamics of the XRP/BTC chart significantly. The prolonged period of sideways movement beneath resistance, followed by this decisive move, introduces a shift in structure that favors continuation to the upside. The price behavior suggests that accumulation has been underway, as the trajectory of the asset over the past few months resembles a rounding bottom formation with multiple retests of the resistance level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The absence of immediate rejection after the recent breakout further supports the thesis that the breakout is legitimate. With BTC’s dominance still relatively high, any sustained upward move by XRP in this pair indicates resilience and relative strength, two factors traders look for when assessing whether an altcoin could lead in upcoming market phases. The asset’s rise could also weaken Bitcoin’s dominance , paving the way for a new altcoin season and a potential all-time high for XRP. From a technical perspective, if the breakout holds and XRP confirms support on a retest, the next logical focus will be on measuring potential targets based on the prior range’s height. While short-term volatility remains possible, the structure now leans bullish, especially if volume increases or if additional altcoin-BTC pairs begin exhibiting similar patterns.

2025-07-12T06:17:28,"Can I Sell My BlockDAG? Bitcoin Solaris Offers Liquid Alternative with Confirmed LBank Exchange Listing","The post Can I Sell My BlockDAG? Bitcoin Solaris Offers Liquid Alternative with Confirmed LBank Exchange Listing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A quiet question has been circulating across Telegram and X: “When can I sell my BlockDAG?” For early supporters, the wait continues as listing timelines remain unclear and secondary liquidity hasn’t fully materialized. While the project still holds promise, some investors are beginning to wonder when theory will turn into traction. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is already showing signs of momentum. With visible liquidity, transparent updates, and a focus on accessibility and performance, it’s capturing the attention of those seeking both innovation and immediate value. BlockDAG: Good Concept, Bad Timing? To be clear, BlockDAG is far from a scam. Its directed acyclic graph architecture has genuine technical merit. The promise of scalable parallel transactions has been around for years, and if implemented correctly, it could work beautifully. But the delays are beginning to overshadow the promise. Many are finding themselves stuck, unable to cash out or even transfer tokens. And in a market where speed equals confidence, stalling is fatal. Bitcoin Solaris Hits LBank and Unlocks Access On the flip side, Bitcoin Solaris is making moves fast. It has already secured a confirmed listing on LBank, which offers immediate peace of mind to investors who want real liquidity from day one. This isn’t speculative. It’s live. Listings like this mean more than just hype. They open the door to: Centralized trading pairs Broader market visibility Price discovery from launch day Safer, smoother user onboarding That kind of infrastructure doesn’t just support users. It empowers them. Why Everyone’s Watching BTC-S Now One of the best breakdowns recently came from Crypto Vlog , which highlighted the project’s upcoming features and why the LBank listing is already positioning BTC-S as a more “sellable” and usable coin than competitors still figuring out their next testnet. It’s not just influencers. Over 14,150 investors have already joined the Bitcoin Solaris presale. That’s a level of traction that demands attention. The Presale That’s Actually Delivering We are in Phase 11 of the BTC-S presale , and it’s racing toward one of the fastest closes in recent memory: Current Price: $11 Launch Price: $20 Potential Gain: 150% More importantly, Bitcoin Solaris has just introduced a Price Rollback, a temporary drop to $5 for a limited time. This isn’t a gimmick or a bonus. It’s a rare opportunity to enter at early-bird prices right before launch. And just to keep it smooth: wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for receiving tokens post-launch. No need to connect or transact through them during the presale. Deep Tech, Real Use So what makes Bitcoin Solaris more than just a name? Dual-consensus model (PoW + DPoS) balances security with lightning-fast performance Up to 10,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer Validator rotation improves decentralization and reduces attack vectors Smart contract execution via Rust for enterprise and DeFi scalability Built-in interoperability for cross-chain assets Mobile-first mining through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App Energy-efficient framework that uses 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin You can even calculate projected mining yield with their live calculator . It’s the kind of transparency and access that BlockDAG holders are still waiting on. Tokenomics That Actually Make Sense BTC-S isn’t just about the now; it’s designed for decades of sustainable use: 66.66% for mining over 90 years 20% for presale 5% for liquidity 2% for development (including Helios DeFi layer) 2% for community rewards 2% for marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This model ensures that 98% of tokens flow to users, miners, and the ecosystem, with zero central hoarding. The Better Exit Plan Can you sell your BlockDAG? Possibly. The potential is there, but timelines remain fluid and clarity is still developing. That’s not unusual for emerging tech, and many still believe in its long-term vision. At the same time, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is moving at a different pace. Exchange listings are already secured, transactions are flowing, and its dual-layer architecture is live and gaining traction. It’s a contrast in timing. While some projects are still preparing, BTC-S is already putting plans into action.

2025-07-12T06:15:47,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Attention as Ethereum Slows and Meme Coins Rise Again","This year’s market rhythm feels familiar: a blue-chip heavyweight slows while smaller, nimbler tokens sprint past. Ethereum’s once-reliable climb has flattened, and a new batch of meme coin favorites is picking up the slack. The name traders keep repeating in chat rooms and threads is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically charged, zero-tax coin that seems to fit 2025’s appetite for narrative and utility in equal measure. Inside MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Traders Are Talking MAGACOIN holders have similar reasons for what has attracted them to the project. Its tax-free transfer ensures gains aren’t nibbled away by a fee each time tokens move wallets, and a security stamp from clearing a HashEx audit already puts it ahead of several meme plays. The project also boasts a straightforward governance model as there are no venture-capital allocations, and every big decision heads to a community vote. Wrapping its tokenomics in a tongue-in-cheek political theme ensures a strong narrative that can keep memes flowing and holders engaged long after the initial pump fades. Numbers back the buzz. Early funding rounds pulled in more than ten million dollars, and on-chain data shows steady wallet growth as word spreads in Telegram channels. Supply is capped at 170 billion tokens, a decision to avoid the endless float that weighs on older meme giants. These features have analysts calling the project a “hybrid narrative token,” one with real mechanics beneath the memes. Ethereum Hits the Brakes Ethereum is still the backbone of decentralized finance, yet its price chart tells a quieter story this year. It sits roughly a quarter below its spring peak, held back by declining activity, and other Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks offer more efficient transaction layers. Even the long-awaited ETF approvals failed to light the usual fire under the market. The lull hasn’t dented Ethereum’s long-term thesis, but it leaves momentum-hungry traders searching elsewhere in the short term. Meme Tokens Find Their Spark Whenever Bitcoin inches toward fresh highs—as it has lately—speculative capital trickles down the ladder, and meme coins often catch the overflow. Dogecoin has posted solid weekly jumps, Shiba Inu isn’t far behind, and newcomers like FARTCOIN and PENGU are making headlines. Yet many of these rallies still hinge on nostalgia or sheer volatility. MAGACOIN offers an extra layer with a story that taps into political theater while keeping token holders in charge of the script. That blend of culture and control draws a crowd that once would have parked money solely in Ethereum or XRP. Final Thoughts Markets thrive on rotation. As Ethereum pauses to catch its breath and meme coins ride a fresh gust of speculative wind, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks well placed to benefit. Its fee-free design, audited code, and community-owned roadmap give it substance, while the political-meme angle supplies the spark. Whether it becomes 2025’s defining breakout remains to be seen, but the ingredients—clear narrative, active holders, and real utility—are already in the pot.

2025-07-12T06:12:48,"Why Is Story (IP) Crypto Rising Today? Key Reasons Behind the Surge","The post Why Is Story (IP) Crypto Rising Today? Key Reasons Behind the Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story (IP) crypto has captured market attention with a sharp price surge, fueled by a breakout from a prolonged consolidation phase. The sudden momentum shift reflects growing market interest, supported by a rise in trading volume and strategic accumulation by larger holders. As Story escapes its previous range, traders are eyeing higher targets amid renewed optimism. This upward move highlights a technically driven rally, suggesting that the asset may be entering a new phase of bullish continuation in the near term. Before analyzing the future projections, let’s see why the Story (IP) price is rising. Bitcoin smashed a new ATH during the past trading day, which has filled the entire crypto market with bullish momentum. The Story price rose above the accumulation zone that it had been stuck at for over a month. Story experienced a massive influx of liquidity of over $148 million, as per some reports, which is speculated to be huge whale activity. A breakout from a technical pattern where the IP price remained accumulated for a long time Despite the current breakout, the IP price failed to secure above a crucial resistance range. Does this suggest the Bulls’ strength was limited, and will this drag the IP price below $4? The latest price breakout led the IP price breakout from the descending parallel channel but failed to surpass the pivotal resistance zone between $4.97 and $5.15. However, this cannot be considered a rejection, as the technicians remain within the bullish frame. The price has surpassed the Gaussian channel, which was bearish and hence a daily close above the range may flip the indicator to bullish. On the other hand, the RSI failed to enter the overbought zone but remains stuck along the upper threshold. The overall sentiment is currently very bullish, wherein the on-chain indicators and technical analysis suggest it has outperformed many altcoins recently. On the other hand, rising whale activity and large trade volumes point to accumulation by major holders. Meanwhile, the volatility remains high, as a rapid squeeze up can be followed by a sharp pullback or correction. Besides, some models expect a decline towards $3.6 by mid-August if buying momentum waves. Wrapping it Up!! Story (IP) is rallying today due to a combination of a broader crypto rally led by Bitcoin and very high trading volume, including potential whale activity and technical breakout patterns. That said, some technical forecasts warn of possible short-term retracements before further upside. For now, the Story (IP) price is maintaining a strong ascending trend with strong bullish momentum and hence is above $5 and will eventually reach $5.5 in the near term.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-story-ip-crypto-rising-today-key-reasons-behind-the-surge/,"TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T06:00:49,"Why The Solana Price Could Crash To $95 Before Reaching $200","The Solana price has fallen by a considerable amount after hitting an all-time high of almost $300 back in January 2025. Even with the recent market recovery, the price is still sitting over 45% below its all-time high price, highlighting the struggles that the altcoin has faced in recent times. Amid this, a crypto analyst has suggested that the Solana price could crash even further from here, predicting a 40% crash could be in the cards once more. Why Solana Could See A Price Crash Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader has highlighted the development of a rare bullish harmonic pattern on the Solana price chart. Now, while this pattern formation is inherently bullish for any digital asset, the shorter term does come with some hurdles for the altcoin to surmount first. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs Above December 2024 Levels, Here’s What Happened Last Time The main thing to focus on here is that this bullish pattern does initially trigger a liquidity sweep of previous lows. In this case, the recent Solana price low lies at the $95 level, which is a 40% decrease from its current price, trending above $150. The possibility of this low sweep is made even more prominent by a couple of technical developments on the chart. The first technical point the analyst shows is the Point of Control (POC) Battle. According to the analysis, the Solana price is now testing this POC level with low momentum, shown by the slow climb over the last few days. Additionally, there is also mounting resistance at the Value Area High and the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which lies just above $163. Then, there is the completion of the C-leg of the wave, putting it as low as $95. A crash to this level becomes more likely if the Solana price fails to break through the resistance with conviction. If the price is rejected and the C-leg does play out, then this correction is expected to trigger the 40% crash to the $95 level. It’s Not All Bearish News As already mentioned above, the bearish leg of the rare bullish harmonic pattern is only temporary and often gives way to an even stronger impulse move. As the crypto analyst explains, the crash to $95 will only happen in the immediate short term, but it does not actually invalidate the overall bullish trend. Related Reading: Market Expert Says It’s Now ‘Illegal’ To Short Bitcoin, Here’s Why Once the D-leg is over and the crash is completed, the crypto analyst predicts that the Solana price will start to rally again. From the predicted $05 lows, an over 100% move is expected to take it back to $200 and beyond before the rally is over. The analyst explains that “Until this scenario is confirmed or invalidated, Solana remains range-bound between major high time frame levels.” Therefore, “Traders should stay alert for signs of rejection at current resistance — or, conversely, a volume-backed breakout above the value area high that would negate the harmonic setup.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-price-crash-to-95-200/,"TRADING|SOL|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Solana|Sol|SOL news|SOL Price|Solana news|Solana Price|SOLUSD|SOLUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T05:52:30,"Report: BTC Treasuries Face $12.8B Maturity Wall by 2028","A looming $12.8 billion debt maturity wall could threaten the sustainability of major Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTC-TCs) like Marathon Digital and Nakamoto by 2028. This is according to a new Keyrock report showing that while such firms collectively hold more than 725,000 BTC, their reliance on capital markets and negative cash flows for acquisitions has made them vulnerable to weakening Bitcoin prices and souring investor sentiment. The Debt-Fueled Accumulation Boom BTC-TCs, public companies using debt and equity to amass Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, have exploded since Strategy pioneered the model in 2020. The Michael Saylor-led business intelligence provider now dominates the sector, holding no fewer than 597,000 BTC, or 82% of the cohort total, valued at about $67 billion at current rates. So far, the steadily growing industry has raised more than $3.35 billion in preferred equity and approximately $9.48 billion in debt, alongside substantial common stock sales to fuel their BTC buying spree. According to Keyrock, this capital structure has created a significant refinancing risk: $12.8 billion in debt maturities, heavily clustered in 2027 and 2028. While convertible notes, such as Strategy’s $7.3 billion in 0% issuance, have become popular and offer potential equity conversion relief, they hinge on sustained high stock prices. This means that if prices fall below conversion thresholds, it could force the BTC-TCs to sell portions of their holdings or resort to distress refinancing, which could trigger downward spirals. Newer entrants like Twenty One Capital and Tokyo-listed Metaplanet are trying to prevent such scenarios by employing varied strategies, including leveraging Japan’s zero rates and getting into SPAC mergers. That being said, Keyrock’s analysis shows that the core reliance on favorable market access remains pervasive across the sector. Sustainability Hinges on Fragile Premiums and Cash Flow Per the report, Bitcoin-focused businesses face two major risks: the cost of paying off their debts and how long they can keep operating without running out of money. Despite this, investors are willing to pay 73% more than the actual value of the BTC these companies hold. They justify this using Strategy as a case study. The firm has boosted its Bitcoin-per-share by about 63.6% each year, thanks to smart fundraising during bull markets that helped it buy more Bitcoin without hurting shareholders. However, according to Keyrock, there’s a big difference in how much cash these firms make. For instance, it says companies like Strategy and Marathon Digital are losing a lot of money from their day-to-day operations, about $78.3 million and $43.5 million each quarter. To stay afloat, they rely entirely on selling new shares at high prices. Nakamoto is in a similar position. Meanwhile, outfits like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and CoinShares are doing better. They either make a profit each quarter or have enough cash saved up, which helps them handle costs without needing to sell shares or dip into their BTC stash. Now, suppose BTC prices drop, or the hoarding strategy fails, and the market stops valuing these companies far above the actual worth of their holdings. In that case, Keyrock analysts claim that Marathon and Nakamoto could run into trouble, forcing them to sell Bitcoin or issue lots of new shares every quarter, which could reduce the value for existing investors. Strategy is also exposed to this risk, but it’s in a stronger position because it’s bigger and investors trust it more.

However, while the euphoria is building, Kiyosaki is urging caution. He warns that many new investors may be jumping in blindly, chasing rapid gains without understanding the volatility that comes with such parabolic runs. The emotional buying hype could easily flip into panic selling, especially if the price corrects sharply. Instead of getting swept up in the hype, Kiyosaki advises staying grounded and advises to focus on education, doing your research, and investing with discipline. In short, while the “Banana Zone” might look like a golden opportunity, it’s also a dangerous trap for the unprepared. “I Am a Fat PIG with Bitcoin,” Says Kiyosaki Kiyosaki bought Bitcoin early, around $6,000, and has made big profits by staying patient and not chasing hype. He credits his success to smart investing, not luck, and continues to support Bitcoin because of its limited supply and independence from governments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Predicts Monster Altcoin Season as Bitcoin Hits New ATH , He still believes a major price surge, the “Banana Zone”, is on the way. He further revealed his latest Bitcoin purchase at $110,000, positioning himself well for the “Banana Zone.” He describes himself as a disciplined “fat pig,” patiently accumulating during market peaks, in contrast to “hogs” who jump in late and get burned. He expects temporary corrections but remains bullish, with a long-term target of $250,000 by 2025 and even $1 million by 2030 . Bitcoin Rises as Faith in Fiat Fades Many investors are starting to lose trust in traditional currencies (such as dollars or euros), primarily because governments are accumulating excessive debt, and people are concerned about inflation. In this environment, Bitcoin is starting to look more attractive, like digital gold, because there’s a limited supply of it, which makes it a good way to protect your wealth. But Kiyosaki and other experts believe this shift in thinking is helping Bitcoin gain momentum . Big institutions are also showing more interest, which adds fuel to the fire. Some analysts suggest that if the U.S. Federal Reserve alters its current policies, particularly by lowering interest rates, Bitcoin could surge again, potentially reaching five- or even six-figure prices. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Wedson noted that the market may have reached a critical “Alpha Price” zone at current levels, and therefore a short-term correction is possible. However, he argued that this decline could create a new buying opportunity within the next few days. On the other hand, he said that if Bitcoin breaks above the $119,300 level, a strong uptrend could begin in the market. Related News: BREAKING: Highly Surprising Move from Coinbase - Official X Account Changes Profile Photo to Surprise Altcoin - Price Jumps Speaking specifically about Cardano, Wedson argued that ADA is currently in a distribution phase, which could present a good entry opportunity in the short term. However, he emphasized that the real breakout could occur in the final quarter of the year, saying, “It's possible that ADA will be trading well above $3 by the end of October or the beginning of November.” While acknowledging that this surge could disrupt some technical analysis patterns, Wedson stated that on-chain data is quite promising. “Our average buy price for ADA is $0.2883.

2025-07-12T04:46:21,"Altcoin Explosion: 90% Beat Bitcoin in 48 Hours as Expert Predicts ‘Larger Altcoin Season’ Already Underway","A long-standing debate on whether or not the altcoin season will kick off this year is still ongoing. Thus far, there have been many opposing outlooks from different market participants. While some are convinced that altcoins will underperform for the rest of the year, others remain optimistic that the highly anticipated altcoin season will come into play before the close of the year. One such analyst who maintains a bullish outlook for altcoin is João Wedson. The verified analyst published on Cryptoquant and CoinMarketCap is sharing yet another bullish take with his 7,000+ follower base. In a post shared on X, the analyst makes a bold assertion, stating that a “mini altcoin season” is in play. Notably, altcoin season is a period when alternative coins outperform Bitcoin for a few weeks to several months. Per Wedson’s observation, as illustrated by an altcoin season index vs Bitcoin chart he shared, 90% of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 72 hours. “After months of saying that June and July would heat up the altcoin market — this is just the beginning! Few will believe we’re in an Altcoin Season because the media and baseless analyses fill your head with hopelessness.” The analyst wrote . It, however, bears mentioning that the Altcoins in question include Altcoins outside the top 100 category. Notably, altcoin season usually kicks off when 75% of the top 100 Altcoins outperform Bitcoin within 90 days. According to data from CoinMarketCap , only 26 out of 100 leading altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The highest value of 30 was last recorded in June, while April 26 marked a yearly low, with only 12 altcoins outpacing Bitcoin. Wedson, who appears to be sticking to his guns, maintains that multiple “mini altcoin seasons” can be observed within a week. He remarks that whale activity is usually heightened at this time, and concludes with an even more bullish forecast for altcoins. “I’ve shared many times that within just one week, several mini Altcoin Seasons can happen — and that’s exactly when whales make fast, massive profits. But make no mistake: a larger Altcoin Season is already underway.” He added.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/altcoin-explosion-90-beat-bitcoin-in-48-hours-as-expert-predicts-larger-altcoin-season-already-underway/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ADA","Cryptocurrency|News|Cardano|Ethereum News|Solana|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T04:42:08,"Investors Are “Suffering Harm” Due To SEC’s Surprise Pause On ETF Holding XRP And Solana, Asserts Grayscale","Asset management giant Grayscale is challenging the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to pause the launch of its large-cap fund holding Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple’s XRP , Solana (SOL) , and Cardano (ADA) , proclaiming its investors are “suffering harm” due to the delay. Grayscale Pushes Back On SEC Pause Grayscale has filed a letter with the SEC in response to the agency’s unexpected pause on its plan to transform the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into a spot ETF. The GDLC primarily comprises Bitcoin, which accounts for 80% of its underlying assets. Another 11% of its holdings are in Ether, while Solana, XRP, and Cardano account for 2.8%, 4.8% and 0.8% of the fund, respectively. In the letter , Grayscale’s legal team urged the Commission to follow rules enacted by Congress that create deadlines for the greenlighting of investment vehicles such as the GDLC. The SEC had already approved the conversion on July 1 on an “accelerated basis”. However, a day later, the regulator issued a stay order to review the approval due to a pending internal review. “Grayscale, the Exchange and the Fund’s current investors are suffering harm as a result of the delay in public launch of the Fund,” the company said. Grayscale also claimed that the fund’s approval should stand by default as the SEC missed its legal deadline to act on the proposal, and that under federal law, the conversion of the fund should be considered automatically approved. The asset manager’s lawyers are now contemplating filing a petition to force the regulator to allow its fund to begin trading as soon as possible. “Grayscale and the Exchange are therefore considering whether to file a petition requesting the Commission to lift the stay imposed by Rule 431(e) while the Commission reviews the action taken by delegated authority, so that the Fund may promptly launch while that review proceeds,” they postulated. The move to convert GDLC into a spot fund is in line with Grayscale’s wider strategy to introduce more crypto products to mainstream financial markets, following the successful introduction of its spot BTC ETF in early 2024. Meanwhile, asset managers have flooded the SEC’s desk with applications for ETF proposals tracking the prices of several cryptocurrencies, including meme coins like Dogecoin and Official Trump and other altcoins, amid a more lenient regulatory backdrop in the United States since crypto-friendly President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/investors-are-suffering-harm-due-to-secs-surprise-pause-on-etf-holding-xrp-and-solana-asserts-grayscale/,"REGULATION|SOL|BUSINESS|XRP|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|Grayscale|SOL|Solana|SOLUSD|XRP News|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T03:40:33,"Bitcoin Must Stay Neutral – Why BTCFi Should Not Follow the Path of Politicized Finance","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Bitcoin has always been the face of crypto and stood for something bigger than just digital money. It’s a technology born from frustration with centralized control systems, and it has thrived because of one key principle – neutrality. Neutrality from politics, from institutions, from borders. Now that BTCFi is picking up the pace, it’s highly important to remember this principle – and defend it. Allowing BTCFi to be steered by the same political and institutional forces that have long shaped traditional finance (TradFi) would mean repeating many of the same historical mistakes that led the world to adopt the concept of crypto in the first place. It would also pose a significant risk to Bitcoin’s core purpose and future viability. The case for political neutrality At its core, Bitcoin was created to be outside of government control, immune to the kind of monetary manipulation that has plagued fiat currencies. Which means that neutrality isn’t a ‘nice-to-have’ in this situation – it’s the foundation upon which everything else is built. Bitcoin works because it doesn’t care where you live – it’s an open, trustless, permissionless system that anyone can take part in so long as they simply have an internet connection. BTCFi must inherit this same core principle. If we start building it around the priorities of state-affiliated actors, there’s a very real risk of Bitcoin changing from a tool of decentralized empowerment into what would basically be just ‘TradFi 2.0.’ Wrapped up in new tech, perhaps, but still governed by the same old rules. Decentralized systems only work if they are decentralized in every way – infrastructure and values alike. What happens if BTCFi gets politicized The answer to this question is simple. Bitcoin could lose the one trait that makes it uniquely valuable and attractive – its neutrality. When institutions or governments influence how BTCFi evolves, the protocols being built will inevitably begin to cater to them. It won’t be long before we see gatekeeping and censorship. The introduction of permissioned systems wrapped in the illusion of decentralization. If we go down that road, Bitcoin’s utility as a neutral global store of value will plummet. And if so, the next wave of financial innovation will likely leave it behind in favor of other assets that are still politically neutral. Is the original cryptocurrency becoming the one that lost its way? I don’t think many people in the industry would want to see it happen. The good news is that the Bitcoin community has the tools to protect BTCFi from such a fate, but there needs to be an intentional approach to this. Let me explain what I mean by that. The path forward – B uilding with purpose Firstly, when DeFi developers work on their infrastructure, they need to make it politically neutral by default. That means no special privileges or reliance on centralized intermediaries. Native Bitcoin layer-twos must be trustless and resilient, and any DeFi product built on top of them should be censorship-resistant and globally accessible. Second, there needs to be more support from crypto investors – especially large holders – for projects that align with Bitcoin’s core values. If capital flows into politically aligned or institutionally influenced products, we’re feeding the wrong machine. Finally, speed matters. If BTCFi products can achieve rapid adoption, it will be that much harder for the whole ecosystem to be hijacked. In other words, momentum is its own form of protection – by outpacing regulators and institutions with centralized interests, they will have a hard time catching up to try and influence BTCFi’s development. But in order to achieve all of the above, developers must focus on making their products usable and safe. Without these two pillars, mass adoption will be a long way off. Investors and the broader community must be actively engaged to promote projects that preserve the ideals of openness and decentralization while also delivering tangible value to people. Why BTCFi is taking off – and why it needs safeguards The momentum behind BTCFi is undeniable. In late 2024, its total value jumped from $800 million to $6.5 billion in just a few months. Some analysts predict that by 2030, over $47 billion worth of Bitcoin could be actively used in DeFi. There are clear reasons for this surge. The growth of Bitcoin ETFs has made BTC the most ‘mainstream’ crypto asset, adding a sense of legitimacy and attracting whales who want to do more with their holdings without selling them. But with that same surge comes attention – regulators and institutions alike are watching and getting involved a lot more actively now. That’s why now is the time to set the tone for how BTCFi evolves. It has the potential to transform how Bitcoin is used, but that transformation will only be meaningful if we stay true to Bitcoin’s foundational values. Bitcoin’s greatest strength is that it doesn’t discriminate or take sides – a nd BTCFi should be no different. Michael Egorov is the founder of leading DeFi exchange Curve Finance . He is a notable figure in the DeFi space, having launched the first DeFi exchange with a focus on stablecoins. A physicist, entrepreneur and crypto maximalist, Michael stood at the origins of DeFi creation.

2025-07-12T03:15:33,"Bitcoin and XRP Target Major Gains as ETF Capital Inflows Accelerate Past $4 Billion","The crypto market is entering a pivotal phase in 2025 as ETF-related capital surges into Bitcoin and XRP, signaling renewed institutional confidence. With inflows now exceeding $4 billion, both assets are seeing strengthened technical setups and increased investor conviction. This fresh momentum is being seen as the beginning of a broader altcoin reaccumulation cycle—one that may extend far beyond just the market leaders. Alongside this surge in legacy assets, a new generation of narrative-driven tokens is beginning to gain attention. Among them is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically themed altcoin quietly building a base of support among those seeking early exposure to conviction-led projects. Bitcoin and XRP Lead the Charge with Institutional Momentum Bitcoin remains the dominant player in institutional crypto portfolios. The approval and rollout of multiple ETFs have made Bitcoin more accessible than ever to traditional investors, including pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers. These inflows are not only driving price resilience but also redefining Bitcoin’s role as a long-term macro asset. XRP has also staged a return to institutional portfolios. With its regulatory uncertainty resolved and Grayscale’s XRP ETF moving forward, the token has re-entered the spotlight. Analysts point to its utility in cross-border transactions, low-fee transfer mechanics, and increasing global adoption as reasons why capital inflows are likely to continue rising. Together, the two assets are serving as anchors for a broader resurgence in crypto market activity—particularly as ETF access reduces barriers for traditional capital. Altcoin Rotation Begins as Traders Search for Narrative-Driven Plays With Bitcoin and XRP stabilizing, seasoned investors are beginning to look down the market cap list. Historically, when large-cap tokens lead ETF-driven rallies, mid-cap and narrative-rich altcoins follow shortly after. Market sentiment is now focused on tokens that reflect strong thematic relevance: political identity, decentralized governance, or real-world application. This environment has created space for newer projects to emerge—particularly those with strong positioning and early traction. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Catching Market Attention As Ethereum solidifies its lead with continued Layer 2 expansion and institutional flows, and XRP reclaims market share following its regulatory resolution, many altcoin traders are looking ahead — toward assets that combine narrative strength with growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping into that spotlight with: A strong political narrative that breaks away from generic crypto themes A defined early advantage phase with high-conviction support Increasing mentions across analyst reports and trading forums Clear signs of preparing for broader exchange visibility As momentum shifts toward high-conviction projects that blend ideology with technology, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its lane at the perfect time. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Political Altcoin with Cultural Relevance Among the early-stage projects attracting analyst attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE . Positioned as a decentralized political memecoin , it stands at the intersection of meme culture and ideological narrative—offering a rare mix of cultural resonance and structural integrity. The project is anchored by a zero-tax trading model, a fixed-supply framework, and a community-driven governance roadmap. Designed to appeal to users aligned with anti-centralization values, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning mentions in altcoin watchlists for its potential to capture attention in a cycle where identity and conviction are key drivers. Its political theme gives it an edge in a saturated market of trend-based tokens, while its early development progress has shown signs of long-term vision rather than short-lived momentum. The Bottom Line: MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be Q3’s Breakout Altcoin With over $4 billion in ETF-related inflows into Bitcoin and XRP, the foundations of a new bull phase may already be forming. For traders and investors seeking something with staying power, ideological relevance, and early access advantages, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most compelling tokens to watch this quarter.
