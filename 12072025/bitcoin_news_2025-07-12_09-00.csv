2025-07-12T06:48:24,"Expert Explains Why XRP Is More Powerful Than Direct Connections","An intriguing post by financial expert Jake Claver has offered a fresh take on XRP’s core utility. Claver emphasized that “XRP doesn’t compete in many currency pair battles. Instead, it pools all liquidity into one central point.” This framing highlights a design where XRP acts as a unified bridge asset rather than a token tied to individual trading pairs. XRP doesn’t compete in many currency pair battles. Instead, it pools all liquidity into one central point. This makes XRP much more powerful than any single direct connection. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) July 10, 2025 Claver’s comment draws attention to XRP’s structural advantage in liquidity sourcing. Meanwhile, Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, had detailed how the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) auto‑bridge feature ensures XRP acts as a central intermediary , optimizing transactions between tokens and reinforcing its liquidity role on the ledger. This mechanism supports growing volumes of tokenized assets, translating into higher XRP usage for both fees and liquidity provision. XRP’s Growing Adoption and Infrastructure Over the longer horizon, the structural liquidity model Claver describes supports broader industry trends. Ripple has seen rapid adoption of its XRP-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product and a notable increase in partnerships, currently working with hundreds of financial institutions. The ODL system uses XRP to settle cross‑border transfers without requiring banks to maintain pre-funded accounts, and this innovation reduces cost and latency in global payments, making XRP a preferred option for cross-border payments. Additionally, XRP’s role is not sidelined by new stablecoin products like RLUSD. While one commenter expressed this concern, Schwartz has previously clarified that RLUSD enhances XRP’s function by introducing alternative settlement paths without reducing XRP’s bridging utility. Higher volumes of tokenized assets on XRPL also help the ecosystem, as it leads to escalating demand for XRP for transaction fees and liquidity. This dynamic affirms XRP as integral to the ledger’s long-term economic model. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX), automated market maker (AMM), and other features gain traction, the digital asset’s central role in enabling liquidity becomes more pronounced. Reactions Reflect Widespread Confidence Multiple community members responded enthusiastically to Claver’s post. Many echoed his assessment by highlighting XRP’s real‑world utility, contrasting it with assets that lack tangible use cases. One commenter shared excitement about XRP’s potential to outperform Bitcoin in practical applications, and another suggested that the asset could reach triple-digit targets by the end of the year. Others reaffirmed that Claver’s liquidity framing is consistent with XRP’s design and mission. XRP enjoys structural strengths often overlooked in speculative discourse, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has reaffirmed the importance of liquidity, predicting that it could capture 14% of SWIFT’s volume within 5 years by prioritizing liquidity provisioning.

2025-07-12T06:45:01,"Bitcoin Dumped for Ethereum: Bit Digital Bets $172M on ETH. Is This the End of Bitcoin Dominance?","A major shift in the crypto world has occurred. Bit Digital has made a massive $172 million move, favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin. This bold bet raises questions about the future of Bitcoin's leading position. What does this mean for the supremacy of cryptocurrencies? Could this signal a new era for other digital coins? The answers may surprise. Analysis powered by Outset PR , a blockchain PR agency that leverages data, trends, and market timing to empower Web3 leaders to maximize every opportunity. Bitcoin Price Flirts with New Highs: Bullish Momentum Builds Source: tradingview Bitcoin is showing strong movement, with prices hovering slightly above $107,000 to $111,000. It is just under a key resistance point at nearly $114,000. If Bitcoin breaks past this, it could aim for around $119,000, a potential jump of about 7%. With a six-month growth of almost 19%, Bitcoin’s upward momentum appears solid. Indicators like the RSI suggest high interest from buyers. The current pattern suggests further gains if Bitcoin maintains its pace and crosses resistance levels. Enthusiasts are hopeful even as cautious optimism prevails, as Bitcoin continues its climb, setting sights on breaking new records. Ethereum Surges: Can ETH Break Past $3000 Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price currently sits between $2420 and $2679, showing a positive trend with a 9.10% increase over the past week. Analysts highlight the nearest resistance level at $2787, which ETH might test soon. If it breaks through, the next target is $3047, promising a potential rise of about 14% from the current range. With the relative strength index near 68, ETH indicates strong momentum but is not overbought just yet. This suggests room for further growth. However, caution is advised as the nearest support at around $2269 could slow things down.

Here are some of the possible reasons behind this impressive price surge that drove XRP to almost $3. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Social Engagements and Network Activity CryptoPotato reported yesterday the notable price move north, which drove XRP from roughly $2.3 to just shy of $3 within a 36-to 48-hour period. Although it failed to go beyond $3 to challenge its January 2018 all-time high and has retraced slightly, the price surge helped XRP overtake USDT in terms of market cap. Some analysts predicted this development, ever warning that most traders would miss it. Santiment also weighed in on the matter, outlining its reasons behind the massive surge. The analytics company noted that this breakout transpired in times when the network behind the token saw an impressive growth, which is seen by the rising number of newly created wallets. More precisely, nearly 7,000 such new addresses were created within 24 hours. XRP has pumped to a high of $2.97 today, breaking out to a 4-month high. This is coinciding with a major increase in network growth (new wallets created) & rise in retail interest across social media. Track these metrics any time on this chart: https://t.co/pk1BSHPO8G pic.twitter.com/AD8sUSUfu6 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 11, 2025 Santiment’s second reason is related to the overall retail interest in the token across social media, where 5.5% of all crypto discussions centered around XRP. This was the highest level since mid-March when Ripple’s CEO announced the end of the prolonged legal battle between the company and the US SEC. Whales and Market Resurgence As XRP was just beginning its breakout, CryptoPotato reported another probable reason that could have driven the asset higher. At the time, the number of large wallets holding at least a million tokens had risen to an all-time high of 2,743 (and 2,742 on the next day). The last reason we will discuss in this article is the overall market resurgence. XRP was not the only cryptocurrency in a consolidation phase for weeks. Bitcoin, the market leader, was in a similar state despite some volatility experienced during the Israel-Iran war. However, it broke out on Wednesday evening and led the entire market into the promised land . After surging to a new all-time high of almost $119,000 on Friday, many altcoins followed suit, including XRP. Being the first, biggest, and arguably most important digital asset, BTC’s moves effect significantly the rest of the market.

2025-07-12T06:34:52,"Athur Hayes Predicts Ethereum’s Surge To $10,000 As ETH Soars Past $3,000","Ethereum (ETH) performed strongly this week, surging to a high of over $3000. Its rise comes as Bitcoin also hits its all-time high of $118,000 , which is a sign that the crypto market is gaining strong momentum with time. Notably, ETH has climbed back above the $3,000 mark for the first time since February, marking a strong recovery after a drop from $4,100 in December 2025 to a low of $1,387 in April. This rebound comes at a time when global markets remain unsettled by renewed tariff disputes and growing political uncertainty tied to former President Trump’s influence on economic policy. That said, Ethereum’s surge in price has raised various optimistic observations and predictions from analysts. In a post, Pentoshi, a popular crypto analyst, highlighted the shifting sentiment around Ethereum, noting that growing capital inflows, especially from public companies, could soon outweigh all ETH issued since the Merge. With Ethereum’s market cap still a fraction of Bitcoin’s, the analyst suggested it won’t take much to trigger significant price moves. He urged the community to put aside bias and recognize the momentum building behind ETH, calling its rise “inevitable” in hindsight. Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of the BitMEX platform, predicted that ETH would hit $10,000 following the ongoing surge. ‘‘ Arise Chikun, it’s time… ETH = $10,000 Yachtzee,’’ Arthur tweeted on Thursday, sharing the chart below Hayes further pointed out that Ethereum is steadily gaining ground against Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC trading pair slowly climbing from its historical lows. Elsewhere, market analyst XForceGlobal recently echoed similar views, predicting that Ethereum as an asset is on track to eventually reach the $10,000 milestone. He emphasized that growing institutional interest, improving fundamentals, and Ethereum’s evolving role in the blockchain ecosystem all support a long-term bullish outlook. “The move up on the shorter timeframes was objectively. ETH is still looking to shoot for a new ATH’s this cycle and should end around $9,000- $10,000, give or take.” XForceGlobal tweeted. No macro scenario is providing a ‘good look’ and remains only ideal in nature using context; however, this remains as my primary idea for now, ‘ Meanwhile, analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted that Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level around $3,500, with a potential breakout on the horizon if bullish momentum persists. He pointed to the growing impact of Ethereum ETFs that include staking features as a possible catalyst, emphasizing that these products could significantly reduce the circulating supply. The further pundit suggested that recent regulatory shifts, such as the SEC’s more favorable stance toward proof-of-stake assets, combined with staking demand, may create the ideal conditions for Ethereum to break past this key barrier. At press time, ETH is trading at $2,981.30, reflecting a 5.28% surge within the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/athur-hayes-predicts-ethereums-surge-to-10000-as-eth-soars-past-3000/,"ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION","Ethereum|Markets|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T06:25:39,"Why is XRP Price Up Today?","The post Why is XRP Price Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price has surged 26% this week, reaching $2.80, driven by a combination of powerful market catalysts. On-chain data reveals that whales now hold over 47 billion XRP, signaling strong institutional confidence. This accumulation, paired with a major short squeeze that liquidated millions in bearish bets, has intensified upward pressure. Additionally, growing speculation around a potential XRP spot ETF has fueled investor excitement, pushing the token closer to a breakout above $3 . What is Driving XRP Price Surge Today? Whale Accumulation Reaches New Peaks According to on-chain data from Santiment , the number of wallets holding over 1 million XRP has reached a record 2,743. These whales now control a combined 47.3 billion XRP. Santiment calls this trend a very positive sign for the fourth-largest crypto asset, reflecting deeper conviction among top-tier holders. Short Squeeze Pushes Price Higher As XRP pushed higher, nearly $31.4 million in short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours alone. With bears getting squeezed out, momentum accelerated. The coin’s open interest now stands at $7.2 billion, its highest in six months and inching closer to the January peak of $8.3 billion. That’s more than double the $3 billion low seen in April, according to CoinGlass . Altcoin Season Heats Up This XRP breakout mirrors broader market excitement. Bitcoin recently smashed records, topping $116,500, while Ethereum gained 17.5 percent on the week, trading near $2,960. Santiment confirms the altcoin season is underway, with traders rotating profits from Bitcoin into major altcoins like XRP. I mentioned that $2.70-$2.90 was the zone to watch out for. So now that $XRP had touched $2.97 and rejected off the 0.786 fib at $2.90, we should stall out for a while, retest the lower support levels before we finally send higher. Exciting times ahead! https://t.co/pydkpn86UI pic.twitter.com/w6XadTDDUk — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 12, 2025 XRP has gained nearly 7% over the past 30 days, steadily building strength since mid-June. It now ranks as the second-best performer this week after Ether. Recently, XRP surpassed a $170 billion market cap. Analysts believe that if XRP clears the $2.90 barrier, a move to $3 is likely. Despite its rally, XRP still trades 18% below its 2018 all-time high, which it nearly reclaimed in January. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Net Worth Climbs to $10B After SEC Settlement , Short and Long-Term Outlook In the near term, if momentum continues and XRP holds above $2.60–$2.65, analysts see $3 as an achievable target by August. Long term, a successful XRP ETF approval combined with sustained whale activity could push the token to $3.50–$4 by Q4 2025. With RSI near 66, technicals still leave room for upside. ETF Buzz Adds Fuel The SEC has fast-tracked ETF reviews, cutting wait times to just 75 days. Futures-based XRP ETFs are expected between July 14 and 25, but the real catalyst would be a spot ETF approval. If that happens, it could change everything for XRP’s future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As of July 12, 2025, XRP is trading around $2.80, up over 8% in the last 24 hours. It has seen a 26% surge this week, reaching its highest levels since late May. Will XRP reach its all-time high this month? XRP’s all-time high is $3.40 (from January 2018). While it has shown strong momentum, some analysts predict it could reach $3.00 by August. A quick move to ATH in July is possible but depends on sustained bullish catalysts. How high can XRP’s price go in 2025? Analysts project XRP could reach $3.50-$4 by Q4 2025, especially with a spot ETF approval.

2025-07-12T06:21:30,"Analyst Says XRP Season Starts Now. Here’s why","XRP has recently moved above a critical resistance level against Bitcoin (BTC), a development that is now drawing serious attention among crypto traders. On the 4-hour timeframe, crypto analyst Alex Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) showed that XRP/BTC closed a strong candle above the longstanding horizontal resistance, marking what appears to be a confirmed breakout after weeks of coiling underneath the threshold. The resistance line had repeatedly rejected price advances, capping XRP’s relative strength against Bitcoin throughout multiple tests. But in the latest price action, the digital asset finally pushed through with consecutive closes above the level, supported by moderate volume. The clean structure and horizontal alignment of the breakout reinforce the technical significance of the move, especially within the context of a larger consolidation range that began forming months ago. Yep I’ve seen enough, XRP season starts now pic.twitter.com/zADad3OaIh — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) July 9, 2025 Cobb Declares XRP Season Cobb responded to the breakout with a confident statement: “Yep I’ve seen enough, XRP season starts now.” While brief, Cobb’s declaration speaks directly to the massive breakout that many traders have been anticipating . Cobb expects XRP to demonstrate relative strength across markets, turning the asset’s trajectory fully positive and possibly signaling renewed investor interest. His observation does not stem from speculation alone. Resistance has become support, and the asset is about to enter bullish territory . What to Expect From XRP This breakout changes the dynamics of the XRP/BTC chart significantly. The prolonged period of sideways movement beneath resistance, followed by this decisive move, introduces a shift in structure that favors continuation to the upside. The price behavior suggests that accumulation has been underway, as the trajectory of the asset over the past few months resembles a rounding bottom formation with multiple retests of the resistance level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The absence of immediate rejection after the recent breakout further supports the thesis that the breakout is legitimate. With BTC’s dominance still relatively high, any sustained upward move by XRP in this pair indicates resilience and relative strength, two factors traders look for when assessing whether an altcoin could lead in upcoming market phases. The asset’s rise could also weaken Bitcoin’s dominance , paving the way for a new altcoin season and a potential all-time high for XRP. From a technical perspective, if the breakout holds and XRP confirms support on a retest, the next logical focus will be on measuring potential targets based on the prior range’s height. While short-term volatility remains possible, the structure now leans bullish, especially if volume increases or if additional altcoin-BTC pairs begin exhibiting similar patterns.

2025-07-12T06:17:28,"Can I Sell My BlockDAG? Bitcoin Solaris Offers Liquid Alternative with Confirmed LBank Exchange Listing","The post Can I Sell My BlockDAG? Bitcoin Solaris Offers Liquid Alternative with Confirmed LBank Exchange Listing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A quiet question has been circulating across Telegram and X: “When can I sell my BlockDAG?” For early supporters, the wait continues as listing timelines remain unclear and secondary liquidity hasn’t fully materialized. While the project still holds promise, some investors are beginning to wonder when theory will turn into traction. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is already showing signs of momentum. With visible liquidity, transparent updates, and a focus on accessibility and performance, it’s capturing the attention of those seeking both innovation and immediate value. BlockDAG: Good Concept, Bad Timing? To be clear, BlockDAG is far from a scam. Its directed acyclic graph architecture has genuine technical merit. The promise of scalable parallel transactions has been around for years, and if implemented correctly, it could work beautifully. But the delays are beginning to overshadow the promise. Many are finding themselves stuck, unable to cash out or even transfer tokens. And in a market where speed equals confidence, stalling is fatal. Bitcoin Solaris Hits LBank and Unlocks Access On the flip side, Bitcoin Solaris is making moves fast. It has already secured a confirmed listing on LBank, which offers immediate peace of mind to investors who want real liquidity from day one. This isn’t speculative. It’s live. Listings like this mean more than just hype. They open the door to: Centralized trading pairs Broader market visibility Price discovery from launch day Safer, smoother user onboarding That kind of infrastructure doesn’t just support users. It empowers them. Why Everyone’s Watching BTC-S Now One of the best breakdowns recently came from Crypto Vlog , which highlighted the project’s upcoming features and why the LBank listing is already positioning BTC-S as a more “sellable” and usable coin than competitors still figuring out their next testnet. It’s not just influencers. Over 14,150 investors have already joined the Bitcoin Solaris presale. That’s a level of traction that demands attention. The Presale That’s Actually Delivering We are in Phase 11 of the BTC-S presale , and it’s racing toward one of the fastest closes in recent memory: Current Price: $11 Launch Price: $20 Potential Gain: 150% More importantly, Bitcoin Solaris has just introduced a Price Rollback, a temporary drop to $5 for a limited time. This isn’t a gimmick or a bonus. It’s a rare opportunity to enter at early-bird prices right before launch. And just to keep it smooth: wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for receiving tokens post-launch. No need to connect or transact through them during the presale. Deep Tech, Real Use So what makes Bitcoin Solaris more than just a name? Dual-consensus model (PoW + DPoS) balances security with lightning-fast performance Up to 10,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer Validator rotation improves decentralization and reduces attack vectors Smart contract execution via Rust for enterprise and DeFi scalability Built-in interoperability for cross-chain assets Mobile-first mining through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App Energy-efficient framework that uses 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin You can even calculate projected mining yield with their live calculator . It’s the kind of transparency and access that BlockDAG holders are still waiting on. Tokenomics That Actually Make Sense BTC-S isn’t just about the now; it’s designed for decades of sustainable use: 66.66% for mining over 90 years 20% for presale 5% for liquidity 2% for development (including Helios DeFi layer) 2% for community rewards 2% for marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This model ensures that 98% of tokens flow to users, miners, and the ecosystem, with zero central hoarding. The Better Exit Plan Can you sell your BlockDAG? Possibly. The potential is there, but timelines remain fluid and clarity is still developing. That’s not unusual for emerging tech, and many still believe in its long-term vision. At the same time, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is moving at a different pace. Exchange listings are already secured, transactions are flowing, and its dual-layer architecture is live and gaining traction. It’s a contrast in timing. While some projects are still preparing, BTC-S is already putting plans into action.

2025-07-12T06:15:47,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Attention as Ethereum Slows and Meme Coins Rise Again","This year’s market rhythm feels familiar: a blue-chip heavyweight slows while smaller, nimbler tokens sprint past. Ethereum’s once-reliable climb has flattened, and a new batch of meme coin favorites is picking up the slack. The name traders keep repeating in chat rooms and threads is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically charged, zero-tax coin that seems to fit 2025’s appetite for narrative and utility in equal measure. Inside MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Traders Are Talking MAGACOIN holders have similar reasons for what has attracted them to the project. Its tax-free transfer ensures gains aren’t nibbled away by a fee each time tokens move wallets, and a security stamp from clearing a HashEx audit already puts it ahead of several meme plays. The project also boasts a straightforward governance model as there are no venture-capital allocations, and every big decision heads to a community vote. Wrapping its tokenomics in a tongue-in-cheek political theme ensures a strong narrative that can keep memes flowing and holders engaged long after the initial pump fades. Numbers back the buzz. Early funding rounds pulled in more than ten million dollars, and on-chain data shows steady wallet growth as word spreads in Telegram channels. Supply is capped at 170 billion tokens, a decision to avoid the endless float that weighs on older meme giants. These features have analysts calling the project a “hybrid narrative token,” one with real mechanics beneath the memes. Ethereum Hits the Brakes Ethereum is still the backbone of decentralized finance, yet its price chart tells a quieter story this year. It sits roughly a quarter below its spring peak, held back by declining activity, and other Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks offer more efficient transaction layers. Even the long-awaited ETF approvals failed to light the usual fire under the market. The lull hasn’t dented Ethereum’s long-term thesis, but it leaves momentum-hungry traders searching elsewhere in the short term. Meme Tokens Find Their Spark Whenever Bitcoin inches toward fresh highs—as it has lately—speculative capital trickles down the ladder, and meme coins often catch the overflow. Dogecoin has posted solid weekly jumps, Shiba Inu isn’t far behind, and newcomers like FARTCOIN and PENGU are making headlines. Yet many of these rallies still hinge on nostalgia or sheer volatility. MAGACOIN offers an extra layer with a story that taps into political theater while keeping token holders in charge of the script. That blend of culture and control draws a crowd that once would have parked money solely in Ethereum or XRP. Final Thoughts Markets thrive on rotation. As Ethereum pauses to catch its breath and meme coins ride a fresh gust of speculative wind, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks well placed to benefit. Its fee-free design, audited code, and community-owned roadmap give it substance, while the political-meme angle supplies the spark. Whether it becomes 2025’s defining breakout remains to be seen, but the ingredients—clear narrative, active holders, and real utility—are already in the pot.

2025-07-12T06:12:48,"Why Is Story (IP) Crypto Rising Today? Key Reasons Behind the Surge","The post Why Is Story (IP) Crypto Rising Today? Key Reasons Behind the Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story (IP) crypto has captured market attention with a sharp price surge, fueled by a breakout from a prolonged consolidation phase. The sudden momentum shift reflects growing market interest, supported by a rise in trading volume and strategic accumulation by larger holders. As Story escapes its previous range, traders are eyeing higher targets amid renewed optimism. This upward move highlights a technically driven rally, suggesting that the asset may be entering a new phase of bullish continuation in the near term. Before analyzing the future projections, let’s see why the Story (IP) price is rising. Bitcoin smashed a new ATH during the past trading day, which has filled the entire crypto market with bullish momentum. The Story price rose above the accumulation zone that it had been stuck at for over a month. Story experienced a massive influx of liquidity of over $148 million, as per some reports, which is speculated to be huge whale activity. A breakout from a technical pattern where the IP price remained accumulated for a long time Despite the current breakout, the IP price failed to secure above a crucial resistance range. Does this suggest the Bulls’ strength was limited, and will this drag the IP price below $4? The latest price breakout led the IP price breakout from the descending parallel channel but failed to surpass the pivotal resistance zone between $4.97 and $5.15. However, this cannot be considered a rejection, as the technicians remain within the bullish frame. The price has surpassed the Gaussian channel, which was bearish and hence a daily close above the range may flip the indicator to bullish. On the other hand, the RSI failed to enter the overbought zone but remains stuck along the upper threshold. The overall sentiment is currently very bullish, wherein the on-chain indicators and technical analysis suggest it has outperformed many altcoins recently. On the other hand, rising whale activity and large trade volumes point to accumulation by major holders. Meanwhile, the volatility remains high, as a rapid squeeze up can be followed by a sharp pullback or correction. Besides, some models expect a decline towards $3.6 by mid-August if buying momentum waves. Wrapping it Up!! Story (IP) is rallying today due to a combination of a broader crypto rally led by Bitcoin and very high trading volume, including potential whale activity and technical breakout patterns. That said, some technical forecasts warn of possible short-term retracements before further upside. For now, the Story (IP) price is maintaining a strong ascending trend with strong bullish momentum and hence is above $5 and will eventually reach $5.5 in the near term.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-story-ip-crypto-rising-today-key-reasons-behind-the-surge/,"TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T06:00:49,"Why The Solana Price Could Crash To $95 Before Reaching $200","The Solana price has fallen by a considerable amount after hitting an all-time high of almost $300 back in January 2025. Even with the recent market recovery, the price is still sitting over 45% below its all-time high price, highlighting the struggles that the altcoin has faced in recent times. Amid this, a crypto analyst has suggested that the Solana price could crash even further from here, predicting a 40% crash could be in the cards once more. Why Solana Could See A Price Crash Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader has highlighted the development of a rare bullish harmonic pattern on the Solana price chart. Now, while this pattern formation is inherently bullish for any digital asset, the shorter term does come with some hurdles for the altcoin to surmount first. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs Above December 2024 Levels, Here’s What Happened Last Time The main thing to focus on here is that this bullish pattern does initially trigger a liquidity sweep of previous lows. In this case, the recent Solana price low lies at the $95 level, which is a 40% decrease from its current price, trending above $150. The possibility of this low sweep is made even more prominent by a couple of technical developments on the chart. The first technical point the analyst shows is the Point of Control (POC) Battle. According to the analysis, the Solana price is now testing this POC level with low momentum, shown by the slow climb over the last few days. Additionally, there is also mounting resistance at the Value Area High and the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which lies just above $163. Then, there is the completion of the C-leg of the wave, putting it as low as $95. A crash to this level becomes more likely if the Solana price fails to break through the resistance with conviction. If the price is rejected and the C-leg does play out, then this correction is expected to trigger the 40% crash to the $95 level. It’s Not All Bearish News As already mentioned above, the bearish leg of the rare bullish harmonic pattern is only temporary and often gives way to an even stronger impulse move. As the crypto analyst explains, the crash to $95 will only happen in the immediate short term, but it does not actually invalidate the overall bullish trend. Related Reading: Market Expert Says It’s Now ‘Illegal’ To Short Bitcoin, Here’s Why Once the D-leg is over and the crash is completed, the crypto analyst predicts that the Solana price will start to rally again. From the predicted $05 lows, an over 100% move is expected to take it back to $200 and beyond before the rally is over. The analyst explains that “Until this scenario is confirmed or invalidated, Solana remains range-bound between major high time frame levels.” Therefore, “Traders should stay alert for signs of rejection at current resistance — or, conversely, a volume-backed breakout above the value area high that would negate the harmonic setup.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-price-crash-to-95-200/,"TRADING|SOL|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Solana|Sol|SOL news|SOL Price|Solana news|Solana Price|SOLUSD|SOLUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T05:52:30,"Report: BTC Treasuries Face $12.8B Maturity Wall by 2028","A looming $12.8 billion debt maturity wall could threaten the sustainability of major Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTC-TCs) like Marathon Digital and Nakamoto by 2028. This is according to a new Keyrock report showing that while such firms collectively hold more than 725,000 BTC, their reliance on capital markets and negative cash flows for acquisitions has made them vulnerable to weakening Bitcoin prices and souring investor sentiment. The Debt-Fueled Accumulation Boom BTC-TCs, public companies using debt and equity to amass Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, have exploded since Strategy pioneered the model in 2020. The Michael Saylor-led business intelligence provider now dominates the sector, holding no fewer than 597,000 BTC, or 82% of the cohort total, valued at about $67 billion at current rates. So far, the steadily growing industry has raised more than $3.35 billion in preferred equity and approximately $9.48 billion in debt, alongside substantial common stock sales to fuel their BTC buying spree. According to Keyrock, this capital structure has created a significant refinancing risk: $12.8 billion in debt maturities, heavily clustered in 2027 and 2028. While convertible notes, such as Strategy’s $7.3 billion in 0% issuance, have become popular and offer potential equity conversion relief, they hinge on sustained high stock prices. This means that if prices fall below conversion thresholds, it could force the BTC-TCs to sell portions of their holdings or resort to distress refinancing, which could trigger downward spirals. Newer entrants like Twenty One Capital and Tokyo-listed Metaplanet are trying to prevent such scenarios by employing varied strategies, including leveraging Japan’s zero rates and getting into SPAC mergers. That being said, Keyrock’s analysis shows that the core reliance on favorable market access remains pervasive across the sector. Sustainability Hinges on Fragile Premiums and Cash Flow Per the report, Bitcoin-focused businesses face two major risks: the cost of paying off their debts and how long they can keep operating without running out of money. Despite this, investors are willing to pay 73% more than the actual value of the BTC these companies hold. They justify this using Strategy as a case study. The firm has boosted its Bitcoin-per-share by about 63.6% each year, thanks to smart fundraising during bull markets that helped it buy more Bitcoin without hurting shareholders. However, according to Keyrock, there’s a big difference in how much cash these firms make. For instance, it says companies like Strategy and Marathon Digital are losing a lot of money from their day-to-day operations, about $78.3 million and $43.5 million each quarter. To stay afloat, they rely entirely on selling new shares at high prices. Nakamoto is in a similar position. Meanwhile, outfits like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and CoinShares are doing better. They either make a profit each quarter or have enough cash saved up, which helps them handle costs without needing to sell shares or dip into their BTC stash. Now, suppose BTC prices drop, or the hoarding strategy fails, and the market stops valuing these companies far above the actual worth of their holdings. In that case, Keyrock analysts claim that Marathon and Nakamoto could run into trouble, forcing them to sell Bitcoin or issue lots of new shares every quarter, which could reduce the value for existing investors. Strategy is also exposed to this risk, but it’s in a stronger position because it’s bigger and investors trust it more.

With this move, GameSquare joins a growing number of companies diversifying their corporate treasuries by investing in digital assets. GameSquare Embraces Ethereum As Part Of Treasury Strategy As the cryptocurrency market regains bullish momentum – highlighted by Bitcoin (BTC) reaching successive all-time highs (ATHs) over the past few days – mainstream interest in digital assets is once again surging. In this context, Ethereum continues to see rising adoption. The Texas-based firm recently completed its initial ETH purchase, acquiring 1,818.84 ETH at a weighted average price of $2,749, totalling $5 million. This marks the first step in GameSquare’s broader plan to deploy $100 million into Ethereum and related digital assets. The company’s strategy focuses on building a crypto-native treasury framework designed to generate sustainable, risk-adjusted yield through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Commenting on the development, Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare said: In partnership with Dialectic and Ryan Zurrer, we are leveraging Medici, Dialectic’s proprietary platform that combines machine learning, automated optimization, and multi-layered risk controls, to target best-in-class risk-adjusted yields of 8-14%, well above current staking benchmarks of 3-4%. Unlike traditional treasury strategies focused around Bitcoin, GameSquare’s ETH allocation seeks to actively generate yield by engaging with DeFi infrastructure, rather than simply holding the asset. This signals a novel growing trend of companies favoring ETH over BTC for treasury diversification. While pursuing higher returns typically involves increased risk, Medici’s reputation for advanced risk management and performance tracking offers a layer of confidence. As more companies embrace ETH-based yield strategies, DeFi protocols are likely to attract deeper liquidity over time. Smart Money Accumulating ETH Despite currently trading about 40% below its ATH of $4,878 – set back in November 2021 – Ethereum is seeing increased accumulation by large investors, often referred to as “smart money.” For instance, recent on-chain data shows that ETH whales – wallets holding between 10,000 to 100,000 ETH – added heavily to their holdings earlier this month, scooping as much as 200,000 ETH. Simultaneously, Ethereum-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gaining traction. Data from SoSoValue indicates nine consecutive weeks of positive inflows as of July 10, reinforcing broader investor interest in ETH. That said, some caution remains warranted, as not all ETH-focused treasury strategies have yielded favorable results historically. At press time, ETH trades at $2,993, up an impressive 7.4% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-adoption-grows-gamesquare-invests-5-million-in-eth-as-part-of-treasury-strategy/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Ethereum|Altcoin|Cryptocurrency|ETH|Ether|Ethereum Adoption|ethereum etf|ethereum treasury strategy|ETHUSDT|GameSquare",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T05:24:56,"Robert Kiyosaki Says, “I Bought Bitcoin at $110K, I Will Buy More on SALE.”","The post Robert Kiyosaki Says, “I Bought Bitcoin at $110K, I Will Buy More on SALE.” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, says Bitcoin may now be entering the “Banana Zone,” a phase defined by Raoul Pal. This stage is characterized by rapid, emotionally driven price gains fueled by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). With Bitcoin recently surging to $118,000 and reaching an all-time high, Kiyosaki cautions that peak euphoria often brings heightened volatility. Kiyosaki agrees with Pal that Bitcoin’s limited supply can trigger sharp price surges when demand spikes, often driven by institutions, media buzz, and retail FOMO, but also brings high volatility. Another RICH DAD LESSON: “PIGs get fat. HOGs get slaughtered.” I state this lesson because I bought my latest BITCOIN at $110k. I am now in position for what Raoul Pal calls “the Banana Zone.” In the Banana Zone the HOGS will rush in….driven to insanity by the dreaded… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 11, 2025 Bitcoin Enters the FOMO-Driven Banana Zone Before getting into the dynamics, let’s understand what is the Banana zone. This phase, often seen in Bitcoin bull markets, tends to be marked by explosive growth fueled by media hype, institutional interest , and retail FOMO. However, while the euphoria is building, Kiyosaki is urging caution. He warns that many new investors may be jumping in blindly, chasing rapid gains without understanding the volatility that comes with such parabolic runs. The emotional buying hype could easily flip into panic selling, especially if the price corrects sharply. Instead of getting swept up in the hype, Kiyosaki advises staying grounded and advises to focus on education, doing your research, and investing with discipline. In short, while the “Banana Zone” might look like a golden opportunity, it’s also a dangerous trap for the unprepared. “I Am a Fat PIG with Bitcoin,” Says Kiyosaki Kiyosaki bought Bitcoin early, around $6,000, and has made big profits by staying patient and not chasing hype. He credits his success to smart investing, not luck, and continues to support Bitcoin because of its limited supply and independence from governments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Predicts Monster Altcoin Season as Bitcoin Hits New ATH , He still believes a major price surge, the “Banana Zone”, is on the way. He further revealed his latest Bitcoin purchase at $110,000, positioning himself well for the “Banana Zone.” He describes himself as a disciplined “fat pig,” patiently accumulating during market peaks, in contrast to “hogs” who jump in late and get burned. He expects temporary corrections but remains bullish, with a long-term target of $250,000 by 2025 and even $1 million by 2030 . Bitcoin Rises as Faith in Fiat Fades Many investors are starting to lose trust in traditional currencies (such as dollars or euros), primarily because governments are accumulating excessive debt, and people are concerned about inflation. In this environment, Bitcoin is starting to look more attractive, like digital gold, because there’s a limited supply of it, which makes it a good way to protect your wealth. But Kiyosaki and other experts believe this shift in thinking is helping Bitcoin gain momentum . Big institutions are also showing more interest, which adds fuel to the fire. Some analysts suggest that if the U.S. Federal Reserve alters its current policies, particularly by lowering interest rates, Bitcoin could surge again, potentially reaching five- or even six-figure prices. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-12T04:46:21,"Altcoin Explosion: 90% Beat Bitcoin in 48 Hours as Expert Predicts ‘Larger Altcoin Season’ Already Underway","A long-standing debate on whether or not the altcoin season will kick off this year is still ongoing. Thus far, there have been many opposing outlooks from different market participants. While some are convinced that altcoins will underperform for the rest of the year, others remain optimistic that the highly anticipated altcoin season will come into play before the close of the year. One such analyst who maintains a bullish outlook for altcoin is João Wedson. The verified analyst published on Cryptoquant and CoinMarketCap is sharing yet another bullish take with his 7,000+ follower base. In a post shared on X, the analyst makes a bold assertion, stating that a “mini altcoin season” is in play. Notably, altcoin season is a period when alternative coins outperform Bitcoin for a few weeks to several months. Per Wedson’s observation, as illustrated by an altcoin season index vs Bitcoin chart he shared, 90% of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 72 hours. “After months of saying that June and July would heat up the altcoin market — this is just the beginning! Few will believe we’re in an Altcoin Season because the media and baseless analyses fill your head with hopelessness.” The analyst wrote . It, however, bears mentioning that the Altcoins in question include Altcoins outside the top 100 category. Notably, altcoin season usually kicks off when 75% of the top 100 Altcoins outperform Bitcoin within 90 days. According to data from CoinMarketCap , only 26 out of 100 leading altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The highest value of 30 was last recorded in June, while April 26 marked a yearly low, with only 12 altcoins outpacing Bitcoin. Wedson, who appears to be sticking to his guns, maintains that multiple “mini altcoin seasons” can be observed within a week. He remarks that whale activity is usually heightened at this time, and concludes with an even more bullish forecast for altcoins. “I’ve shared many times that within just one week, several mini Altcoin Seasons can happen — and that’s exactly when whales make fast, massive profits. But make no mistake: a larger Altcoin Season is already underway.” He added.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/altcoin-explosion-90-beat-bitcoin-in-48-hours-as-expert-predicts-larger-altcoin-season-already-underway/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ADA","Cryptocurrency|News|Cardano|Ethereum News|Solana|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T04:42:08,"Investors Are “Suffering Harm” Due To SEC’s Surprise Pause On ETF Holding XRP And Solana, Asserts Grayscale","Asset management giant Grayscale is challenging the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to pause the launch of its large-cap fund holding Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple’s XRP , Solana (SOL) , and Cardano (ADA) , proclaiming its investors are “suffering harm” due to the delay. Grayscale Pushes Back On SEC Pause Grayscale has filed a letter with the SEC in response to the agency’s unexpected pause on its plan to transform the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into a spot ETF. The GDLC primarily comprises Bitcoin, which accounts for 80% of its underlying assets. Another 11% of its holdings are in Ether, while Solana, XRP, and Cardano account for 2.8%, 4.8% and 0.8% of the fund, respectively. In the letter , Grayscale’s legal team urged the Commission to follow rules enacted by Congress that create deadlines for the greenlighting of investment vehicles such as the GDLC. The SEC had already approved the conversion on July 1 on an “accelerated basis”. However, a day later, the regulator issued a stay order to review the approval due to a pending internal review. “Grayscale, the Exchange and the Fund’s current investors are suffering harm as a result of the delay in public launch of the Fund,” the company said. Grayscale also claimed that the fund’s approval should stand by default as the SEC missed its legal deadline to act on the proposal, and that under federal law, the conversion of the fund should be considered automatically approved. The asset manager’s lawyers are now contemplating filing a petition to force the regulator to allow its fund to begin trading as soon as possible. “Grayscale and the Exchange are therefore considering whether to file a petition requesting the Commission to lift the stay imposed by Rule 431(e) while the Commission reviews the action taken by delegated authority, so that the Fund may promptly launch while that review proceeds,” they postulated. The move to convert GDLC into a spot fund is in line with Grayscale’s wider strategy to introduce more crypto products to mainstream financial markets, following the successful introduction of its spot BTC ETF in early 2024.

2025-07-12T03:40:33,"Bitcoin Must Stay Neutral – Why BTCFi Should Not Follow the Path of Politicized Finance","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Bitcoin has always been the face of crypto and stood for something bigger than just digital money. It’s a technology born from frustration with centralized control systems, and it has thrived because of one key principle – neutrality. Neutrality from politics, from institutions, from borders. Now that BTCFi is picking up the pace, it’s highly important to remember this principle – and defend it. Allowing BTCFi to be steered by the same political and institutional forces that have long shaped traditional finance (TradFi) would mean repeating many of the same historical mistakes that led the world to adopt the concept of crypto in the first place. It would also pose a significant risk to Bitcoin’s core purpose and future viability. The case for political neutrality At its core, Bitcoin was created to be outside of government control, immune to the kind of monetary manipulation that has plagued fiat currencies. Which means that neutrality isn’t a ‘nice-to-have’ in this situation – it’s the foundation upon which everything else is built. Bitcoin works because it doesn’t care where you live – it’s an open, trustless, permissionless system that anyone can take part in so long as they simply have an internet connection. BTCFi must inherit this same core principle. If we start building it around the priorities of state-affiliated actors, there’s a very real risk of Bitcoin changing from a tool of decentralized empowerment into what would basically be just ‘TradFi 2.0.’ Wrapped up in new tech, perhaps, but still governed by the same old rules. Decentralized systems only work if they are decentralized in every way – infrastructure and values alike. What happens if BTCFi gets politicized The answer to this question is simple. Bitcoin could lose the one trait that makes it uniquely valuable and attractive – its neutrality. When institutions or governments influence how BTCFi evolves, the protocols being built will inevitably begin to cater to them. It won’t be long before we see gatekeeping and censorship. The introduction of permissioned systems wrapped in the illusion of decentralization. If we go down that road, Bitcoin’s utility as a neutral global store of value will plummet. And if so, the next wave of financial innovation will likely leave it behind in favor of other assets that are still politically neutral. Is the original cryptocurrency becoming the one that lost its way? I don’t think many people in the industry would want to see it happen. The good news is that the Bitcoin community has the tools to protect BTCFi from such a fate, but there needs to be an intentional approach to this. Let me explain what I mean by that. The path forward – B uilding with purpose Firstly, when DeFi developers work on their infrastructure, they need to make it politically neutral by default. That means no special privileges or reliance on centralized intermediaries. Native Bitcoin layer-twos must be trustless and resilient, and any DeFi product built on top of them should be censorship-resistant and globally accessible. Second, there needs to be more support from crypto investors – especially large holders – for projects that align with Bitcoin’s core values. If capital flows into politically aligned or institutionally influenced products, we’re feeding the wrong machine. Finally, speed matters. If BTCFi products can achieve rapid adoption, it will be that much harder for the whole ecosystem to be hijacked. In other words, momentum is its own form of protection – by outpacing regulators and institutions with centralized interests, they will have a hard time catching up to try and influence BTCFi’s development. But in order to achieve all of the above, developers must focus on making their products usable and safe. Without these two pillars, mass adoption will be a long way off. Investors and the broader community must be actively engaged to promote projects that preserve the ideals of openness and decentralization while also delivering tangible value to people. Why BTCFi is taking off – and why it needs safeguards The momentum behind BTCFi is undeniable. In late 2024, its total value jumped from $800 million to $6.5 billion in just a few months. Some analysts predict that by 2030, over $47 billion worth of Bitcoin could be actively used in DeFi. There are clear reasons for this surge. The growth of Bitcoin ETFs has made BTC the most ‘mainstream’ crypto asset, adding a sense of legitimacy and attracting whales who want to do more with their holdings without selling them. But with that same surge comes attention – regulators and institutions alike are watching and getting involved a lot more actively now. That’s why now is the time to set the tone for how BTCFi evolves. It has the potential to transform how Bitcoin is used, but that transformation will only be meaningful if we stay true to Bitcoin’s foundational values. Bitcoin’s greatest strength is that it doesn’t discriminate or take sides – a nd BTCFi should be no different. Michael Egorov is the founder of leading DeFi exchange Curve Finance .

2025-07-12T03:15:33,"Bitcoin and XRP Target Major Gains as ETF Capital Inflows Accelerate Past $4 Billion","The crypto market is entering a pivotal phase in 2025 as ETF-related capital surges into Bitcoin and XRP, signaling renewed institutional confidence. With inflows now exceeding $4 billion, both assets are seeing strengthened technical setups and increased investor conviction. This fresh momentum is being seen as the beginning of a broader altcoin reaccumulation cycle—one that may extend far beyond just the market leaders. Alongside this surge in legacy assets, a new generation of narrative-driven tokens is beginning to gain attention. Among them is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically themed altcoin quietly building a base of support among those seeking early exposure to conviction-led projects. Bitcoin and XRP Lead the Charge with Institutional Momentum Bitcoin remains the dominant player in institutional crypto portfolios. The approval and rollout of multiple ETFs have made Bitcoin more accessible than ever to traditional investors, including pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers. These inflows are not only driving price resilience but also redefining Bitcoin’s role as a long-term macro asset. XRP has also staged a return to institutional portfolios. With its regulatory uncertainty resolved and Grayscale’s XRP ETF moving forward, the token has re-entered the spotlight. Analysts point to its utility in cross-border transactions, low-fee transfer mechanics, and increasing global adoption as reasons why capital inflows are likely to continue rising. Together, the two assets are serving as anchors for a broader resurgence in crypto market activity—particularly as ETF access reduces barriers for traditional capital. Altcoin Rotation Begins as Traders Search for Narrative-Driven Plays With Bitcoin and XRP stabilizing, seasoned investors are beginning to look down the market cap list. Historically, when large-cap tokens lead ETF-driven rallies, mid-cap and narrative-rich altcoins follow shortly after. Market sentiment is now focused on tokens that reflect strong thematic relevance: political identity, decentralized governance, or real-world application. This environment has created space for newer projects to emerge—particularly those with strong positioning and early traction. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Catching Market Attention As Ethereum solidifies its lead with continued Layer 2 expansion and institutional flows, and XRP reclaims market share following its regulatory resolution, many altcoin traders are looking ahead — toward assets that combine narrative strength with growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping into that spotlight with: A strong political narrative that breaks away from generic crypto themes A defined early advantage phase with high-conviction support Increasing mentions across analyst reports and trading forums Clear signs of preparing for broader exchange visibility As momentum shifts toward high-conviction projects that blend ideology with technology, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its lane at the perfect time. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Political Altcoin with Cultural Relevance Among the early-stage projects attracting analyst attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE . Positioned as a decentralized political memecoin , it stands at the intersection of meme culture and ideological narrative—offering a rare mix of cultural resonance and structural integrity. The project is anchored by a zero-tax trading model, a fixed-supply framework, and a community-driven governance roadmap. Designed to appeal to users aligned with anti-centralization values, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning mentions in altcoin watchlists for its potential to capture attention in a cycle where identity and conviction are key drivers. Its political theme gives it an edge in a saturated market of trend-based tokens, while its early development progress has shown signs of long-term vision rather than short-lived momentum. The Bottom Line: MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be Q3’s Breakout Altcoin With over $4 billion in ETF-related inflows into Bitcoin and XRP, the foundations of a new bull phase may already be forming. For traders and investors seeking something with staying power, ideological relevance, and early access advantages, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most compelling tokens to watch this quarter.

2025-07-12T03:00:31,"Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes","Bitcoin has surpassed its previous all-time high, reaching $118,254 and marking a notable milestone in its price trajectory. This latest milestone comes after BTC’s former high at $111,000 levels in May, representing a 10% gain over the past week and roughly 5.9% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $117,584. The sharp price increase appears to be giving strength to activity among both miners and leveraged traders, prompting a closer examination of current market behavior. Analysts monitoring on-chain activity have flagged a resurgence of miner activity alongside a rise in derivative positions, suggesting multiple forces may now be contributing to price movements. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY—If Treasury Firms Hold As these two segments of the market engage more actively, questions are emerging around the sustainability of this rally and whether these behaviors signal confidence or caution. The current on-chain environment shows both selling pressure from miners and increased exposure from long-positioned traders. Bitcoin Miner Activity Rises Alongside Price Surge One of CryptoQuant’s QuickTake contributors, Arab Chain, observed a marked increase in miner activity as Bitcoin crossed the $118,000 level. According to the analyst, this uptick in activity is tied to miner transfers to exchanges, marking the first such increase since May 23. This trend suggests miners could be taking advantage of recent price gains to realize profits. As Arab Chain explained, “The continued activity of miners, coupled with Bitcoin’s price rising to new highs, clearly indicates that they are selling Bitcoin.” Despite this renewed transfer volume, miner behavior has not yet reached the scale of over-the-counter (OTC) selling seen in previous months. Historically, large-scale selling by miners has introduced notable volatility into the market, particularly when sustained across a broader period. The analyst also pointed out the economic leverage miners hold in decision-making, owing to their ability to manage operational costs and balance between holding and selling mined Bitcoin. Whether this increase in exchange flows will develop into heavier selling remains to be seen. Derivatives Market Shows Renewed Leverage Exposure In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Enigma Trader focused on derivatives market activity, highlighting a 24% surge in open interest from approximately $33 billion on July 1 to over $41 billion by July 11. The timing of this increase coincides with Bitcoin’s breakout above $118,000, and reflects renewed leveraged interest following a reset late last month. This level of open interest suggests that traders are positioning more aggressively, potentially anticipating continued upside. The analyst also noted a shift in funding rates from negative to their highest positive reading in a month, around 0.012% per eight hours. Positive funding indicates that long-positioned traders are paying to maintain their positions, a sign of bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Intact, But Binance Activity Warns Of Short-Term Pullback However, Enigma Trader cautioned that such positioning can become precarious if momentum slows. “This setup often fuels upside continuation if spot demand backs it, but also increases the risk of a long squeeze should momentum stall,” the analyst wrote.

2025-07-12T02:00:54,"No Mania Yet: Bitcoin ATH Lacks Hype, Suggesting Further Upside Potential","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to post new all-time highs (ATH), reaching as much as $118,869 on Binance, market indicators show little sign of overheating. The lack of retail-driven hype amid BTC’s record-breaking run suggests there may still be room for further growth in the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin ATH Sees Absence Of Hype According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkemeci, Bitcoin’s current rally is notably characterized by the absence of retail investors. The contributor argues that this lack of retail participation implies BTC may still have significant upside potential. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets The analysis centers on the Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge metric, which tracks the frequency of retail trading activity in the Bitcoin spot market. The analyst shared the following chart to illustrate the trend. When retail trading activity rises significantly compared to the one-year moving average (MA), the chart forms bubbles. Green bubbles indicate that there are very few retail investors currently in the market. Orange bubbles show that trading activity among retail investors is picking up. Similarly, red bubbles indicate caution, hinting that there are too many retail investors in the market and that it may be a good time to consider exit strategies. As the below chart shows, retail activity remains subdued – even as BTC continues to reach new ATHs. In fact, the metric has stayed within the gray zone since March 2024, reflecting a lack of mass retail entry. Historically, retail trading tends to surge as BTC approaches or exceeds ATH levels. The analyst notes that this absence may indicate the cycle top is still ahead: The bull market is still largely driven by institutions and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). When retail finally enters the scene, that might mark the beginning of the final phase. BTC Witnessing Subdued Selling Pressure In addition to the low retail presence, other on-chain indicators suggest that Bitcoin’s current rally is not overheating. For example, the Miner Position Index has been declining since November 2024, implying reduced selling pressure from miners. Another key metric, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, is holding steady around 2.2 – below the 2.7 levels observed during ATHs in March and December 2024. Recent analysis predicts the next significant resistance may emerge at around $130,900. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up?

2025-07-12T02:00:16,"BlackRock Bitcoin ETF becomes fastest in history to reach $80B AUM","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has made financial history as the fastest ETF to reach $80 billion in assets under management (AUM). BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) gathered $80 billion in AUM in just 374 days since launch, making for the most rapid ascent to that figure in ETF history. According to SoSoValue data, IBIT saw $448 million in net inflows on July 10. On the same day, trading volume exceeded $5.39 billion, reflecting strong liquidity and sustained investor demand. The ETF’s net asset value is $80.11 billion, with each share trading around $64.50. These numbers represent not just a lot of money going into IBIT, but also the inclination of Bitcoin’s market value. IBIT now owns over 700k BTC and is one of BTC’s largest institutional holders. This holding represents around 3.55% of the total amount of Bitcoin. The fund was doing well amid a spurt in investor confidence in Bitcoin and the demand for exposure in a secure, regulated form. Unlike having Bitcoin directly under management, these ETFs, like IBIT, mean you can gain exposure without handling wallets or private keys, making them an attractive prospect for institutional/traditional investors. IBIT outpaces traditional ETFs and gold Though the meteoric trajectory of IBIT has no precedence in the crypto space, it has also outperformed the most successful traditional ETFs. IEFA required 2,034 days to achieve the same level while IEMG required 2,089 days. In contrast, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF achieved this in just over a year. However, and in complete contrast, IBIT pulled off the task within a little over a year. Source: Eric Balchunas X According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the growth was “historic,” noting that IBIT hit the AUM milestone five times faster than any other fund. He also pointed out that the combined total AUM for all US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs has topped over $140 billion for the first time. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has also beaten gold to the accumulation finish line. It has taken in $70 billion AUM five times faster than gold-backed EFTs captured that level. This is a sign that more and more people are treating Bitcoin not as a risky bet, but are comparing it to something like traditional commodities in being a store of value. This change is crucial, as international financial uncertainty encourages investors to find alternative methods to protect themselves against inflation and fiat currency fluctuation. Bitcoin, the “digital gold,” is being looked at in some quarters as a rival to physical gold in institutional portfolios. IBIT accelerates toward matching Satoshi’s Bitcoin holdings Another major milestone has been reached: BlackRock’s IBIT is home to more than 700k BTC . This puts the firm on course to top the estimated holdings of Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who is thought to have as much as 1 million BTC. If the current pace of accumulation continues, BlackRock would exceed that amount by 2026. Today, IBIT is the 21st largest ETF in the world — a stunning accomplishment for an upstart newcomer. Its success has reset the baseline for how swiftly a crypto-related financial product can earn trust and traction on Wall Street. This shift mirrors a fundamental change in the relationship between digital assets and traditional financial systems. Institutional players hesitated to get involved with crypto for years, citing volatility, lack of regulation, and security issues. However, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly one that Forbes reported was backed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, opens a new chapter. With ongoing interest from pension funds, family offices, and big wealth managers, the fund will likely experience even bigger inflows as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream in finance.

2025-07-12T01:00:11,"Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800—Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap?","Bitcoin’s summer rally accelerated in the early hours of 11 July, when the benchmark cryptocurrency sliced through $118,000 and printed exchange highs that peaked above $118,800, depending on venue data. The spike wiped out an estimated $1.25 billion in short positions within a single trading day, according to CoinGlass figures. Bitcoin Bull Trap Or Breakout? Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards took to X as the breakout unfolded. “New all-time highs beget new ATHs. It’s usually unwise to ignore a major breakout like this, until invalidated,” he wrote, adding that corporate treasury demand has “grown exponentially, with dozens of new companies popping up in recent months.” Edwards’ base-case projection calls for a further 50–70 percent advance over the next six months—roughly $170,000–$196,000. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY—If Treasury Firms Hold His focus on treasuries is backed by hard data. Public companies added a record 159,107 BTC in Q2—pushing aggregate corporate holdings above 847,000 BTC, or about four percent of max supply. Corporate Bitcoin acquisitions have even outpaced ETF net inflows. Matthew Sigel, head of digital-asset research at VanEck, framed Bitcoin’s trajectory within a broader macro and policy backdrop. “The natural course for Bitcoin remains higher, driven by persistent US debt and deficit problems, demographic tailwinds, a weakening dollar, growing momentum around Fed rate cuts, and the potential for a new Fed chair next year,” he wrote on X. Sigel also highlighted Capitol Hill’s looming “Crypto Week,” where stablecoin legislation is widely viewed as the most passable of several digital-asset bills. Those developments, he argues, make $180,000 “very much in play for 2025.” Law-makers appear to share the sense of urgency. A press statement from the House Financial Services Committee confirms that the week of 14 July will be dedicated to advancing the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the GENIUS Act. Passage would establish the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins and market structure, a change Sigel says could “unlock wide-open capital markets” for the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns Spot Bitcoin ETFs are hardly idle: net inflows into BlackRock’s iShares fund alone have pushed its holdings past 700,000 BTC in the 18 months since launch. Yet Edwards and Sigel both note that treasury companies have become the marginal buyer in 2025. The dynamic creates what Edwards calls a “cap-raising flywheel,” as firms showcase outperforming share prices—up nearly 60 percent year-to-date for the treasury cohort—when courting investors. Notably, the rally is unfolding against a supportive macro backdrop. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller told a Dallas Fed audience he is “open to cutting the policy rate in July,” arguing current settings are “too tight” given waning inflation pressures. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Fed chair Jerome Powell over the past weeks, demanding immediate rate cuts. Trump’s tariff escalation also seems to fade out, supporting the Bitcoin rally. Notwithstanding euphoric headlines, technicians warn that momentum must sustain above $110,000 to avoid a failed-breakout pattern. “This theory would be weakened with closes below $110K and invalidated below $105K,” Edwards concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $117,854.

2025-07-12T00:48:05,"Robert Kiyosaki warns of banana zone FOMO as BTC eyes $124K","Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has issued a stark warning to crypto investors worldwide. On X, he warned that Bitcoin’s most recent surge put the cryptocurrency in what he described as the “ Banana Zone ,” ripe for potentially damaging emotional decision making based on FOMO, the fear of missing out. Bitcoin recently jumped above $117,000, a new record peak, igniting speculation it could surge as high as $124,000 or higher. Kiyosaki has a great answer to the run-up: Don’t go by emotion but strategy. “Be a smarter investor,” he said, noting that impulsive purchasing during euphoric market cycles is often associated with crippling losses. “Don’t be a HOG. HOGs get slaughtered. Be a PIG instead. PIGs get fat.” He shared that his buys were at $110,000, indicating conviction that we are long-term bullish, and cautioned against diving into the market at the top for no particular reason. His strategy? Wait for the market to correct, then buy back at a discount. Traders fuel fear and greed in banana zone rally Real Vision CEO and macro investor Raoul Pal is credited with popularizing the “Banana Zone”. It refers to a phase of rapid, nearly vertical price growth typically limited to high-demand, low-supply assets such as Bitcoin. Kiyosaki expressed a similar sentiment to Pal, stating that the “limited” nature of Bitcoin means that when there is an appetite for the coin, thereby driving up its interest, it faces a ton of upward pressure due to its scarcity. This cycle is usually driven by institutional adoption, media frenzy, and retail investor frenzy. It delivers the possibility of explosive gains but also introduces volatility, extreme risk, and emotional trading. As with previous surges, the current burst of optimism could lead to a short-lived price spike and some real downside risk, Kiyosaki said. He cautioned that many fresh investors are diving into the markets without understanding how fickle a game trading cryptocurrency can be. This flood of FOMO-driven buyers, he said, could add significant instability to the market. He said that as the price only goes up, inexperienced investors could become panicky, resulting in a “slaughtering” of those who bought in at these levels. In Kiyosaki’s view, this stage sees many investors piling in without doing any independent research, hoping for a quick buck. This “herd instinct” frequently results in excessive buying at the peak, with mass panic selling when the price “falls off a cliff”. He said investors should focus on educating themselves instead of chasing price surges while maintaining discipline. He cautioned that this was not the time to follow the crowd blindly, but rather an opportunity to sharpen their thinking. Traders push Bitcoin higher as risk escalates Bitcoin’s climb to $118,000 has bulls and analysts cheering. Some in the market believe the asset is in the early stages of a long-term bull run. Estimates of $124,000 or more are already being labeled conservative by certain circles. The more aggressive forecasters call for $250,000 by the end of 2025, and even $1 million by 2030 — particularly if macroeconomic travails continue to erode faith in fiat currencies. Kiyosaki, an ardent critic of central bank control over global monetary policy and fiat currency systems, believes Bitcoin is “people’s money” and that the flagship cryptocurrency presents a strong hedge against inflation. He’s sung Bitcoin’s praises for its fixed supply and decentralized nature multiple times. In June 2024, he repeated his faith in Raoul Pal’s Banana Zone theory and became a legendary figure of the upcoming bull market. He says he bought his first Bitcoin when the price was $6,000. Those early decisions have more than paid off, and he emphasizes that gains did so because he was investing smart and patiently, not gambling on hype.
