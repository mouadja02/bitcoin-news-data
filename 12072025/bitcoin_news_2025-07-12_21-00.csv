In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Robinhood CIO Stephanie Guild says that she believes the S&P 500 may close the year at around 6,200, though a move to 6,500 is on the table. “I started [the year] at 6,500. When tariffs hit, I said GDP could come down and that could impact earnings. Usually, a 1% hit on GDP is about a 4% hit on earnings. We’ve seen earnings expectations come down. I said there was risk to 5,800, but I never went there. And now I think there’s risk to 6,500 – obviously we’re over my target. But with the pumping up of potential tariffs now I’m just sort of waiting to see what happens… This is all driven by tariffs, but is driven by our president, who also cares about the economy and wants the economy to grow… If [the Fed] cut, then you definitely get 6,500…because then it just like reaffirms what the market has been hoping for.” Guild also says that ahead of next week’s bank earnings, she believes regional banks will outperform the big banks in the coming months. “I’m more bullish on the regionals than the large [banks]…I think they’ll just benefit more from deregulation. And if we do get some rate cuts this year, which I think we should, but obviously there are reasons why they haven’t been cut yet, then I think you do get a steeper [yield] curve and then that does help [regional banks] as well.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The DOJ says it has identified 324 defendants in an alleged $14.6 billion fraud scheme comprising of several different scam tactics targeting Americans. In one scheme that targeted vulnerable elderly patients – some of whom were in hospices – defendants are accused of applying medically unnecessary amniotic allografts to the patients’ wounds, and then receiving millions of dollars worth of illegal kickbacks from a fraudulent billing scheme. In another alleged fraud, 74 defendants, including 44 licensed medical professionals, are accused of illegally peddling 15 million pills of prescription opioids and other controlled substances. Another charge was filed in the Northern District of Illinois against five defendants, including two owners and executives at Pakistani marketing companies, whose alleged fraud involved a $703 million Medicare scam. The DOJ says victims of the scheme had their identification numbers and other confidential health information stolen through theft and deceptive marketing. As part of the investigation, the DOJ seized $245 million worth of cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency and other assets, “demonstrating the significant return on investment that results from health care fraud enforcement efforts.” Says Robert Murphy of the DEA, “Health care fraud isn’t just theft — it’s trafficking in trust. Today’s announcement shows that when doctors become drug dealers and treatment centers become profit-driven fraud rings, DEA will act… We’re targeting the entire ecosystem of fraud — from pill mills in Texas to kickback clinics exploiting Native communities.

2025-07-12T18:16:45,"As Ethereum ETFs gain on Bitcoin, retail investors see new options","Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had their best week since the launch with record net inflows of $907.99 million. This is the largest weekly inflow since Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024, per SoSoValue. The inflows were heavily concentrated on three consecutive days, July 9, 10, and 11, suggesting strong and sustained investor demand. The largest daily inflow occurred on July 10, when ETH ETFs had an influx of $383.10 million. The next two strongest days saw a similarly slight disparity: $211.32 million on July 9 and $204.82 million on July 11. According to market analyst Nate Geraci, ETH still sees strong inflows; three of ETH ETF’s top 10 inflow days have happened this week. Institutional demand is increasing, suggesting growing market sentiment for Ethereum products. This explosion is particularly strong given that Ethereum ETFs started out slowly. With better regulatory clarity and investors clamoring for them, 2025 looks like it will be their breakout year. ETH rally generates excitement among investors ETH is up over 17% over the last week, with a break and hold above $3,000 occurring on July 11. It’s the first time the token has returned to that psychological level in months. ETF purchases partially fuel the rally, which removes supply from the open market. Plus, since Ethereum gets widespread use across DeFi, smart contracts, and staking rewards, it’s still catching the eye of both retail and institutional investors. Ethereum’s surge in recent weeks has been sustained, with buying pressure showing few signs of ebbing, and not just a wave of speculators seeking quick gains, CoinMarketCap data shows. Analysts think that as long as macro is conducive, inflation and interest rates are stable, for example, Ethereum will be ready to move higher in the coming weeks. To add to the intrigue, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw its holdings over 2 million ETH as of July 10. That’s worth about $300 million — a reflection of the growing interest on Wall Street in Ethereum’s long-term value propositions. As Ethereum ETFs gain on Bitcoin, retail investors see new options Ethereum ETFs are encroaching on Bitcoin ETFs, the group that has dominated the crypto ETF space. Their 2024 launches were met with cautious optimism and lackluster retail flows for the most part. All of that is starting to change, and fast. According to reports, BlackRock is purchasing significantly more ETH than BTC. This indicates a narrative shift, with Wall Street investors warming up to the second-largest crypto by market cap. One thing setting off this interest is Ethereum’s use as a yield-producing asset through staking, which investors find appealing in a low-return world. The ETH price’s response was not immediate, although accumulation via the ETF would still reduce the coin’s supply. Thanks to its network, which has a dominant ecosystem play in dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFTs, ETH also has a strong utility-based value proposition. Suppose other traditional financial institutions enter the crypto market more. In that case, the Ethereum ETF market might expand, accounting for an even higher percentage of the overall crypto ETF market. Although Bitcoin leads the charge in total ETF volume, ETH is gaining on it quicker than most anticipated. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-12T18:02:54,"R. Kiyosaki warns Bitcoin ‘FOMO disease’ is coming","Author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has issued a cautionary message to Bitcoin ( BTC ) investors as the leading cryptocurrency trades at new highs. According to the Rich Dad Poor Dad author, investors should brace for a possible wave of panic buying driven by fear of missing out (FOMO), a trend he believes will result in losses for many, Kiyosaki said in an X post on July 11. Interestingly, Kiyosaki revealed that he recently bought more Bitcoin at $110,000, positioning himself for what he calls the “Banana Zone”, a phase of rapid price surges that typically attracts emotional, late-stage investors. He likened patient buyers to ‘pigs’ who benefit by accumulating early, while warning that impulsive ‘hogs’ risk losses by chasing inflated prices. He expects these latecomers to panic sell during market dips, while disciplined investors will wait to buy the dip. Another RICH DAD LESSON: “PIGs get fat. HOGs get slaughtered.” I state this lesson because I bought my latest BITCOIN at $110k. I am now in position for what Raoul Pal calls “the Banana Zone.” In the Banana Zone the HOGS will rush in….driven to insanity by the dreaded… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 11, 2025 Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin bullish stand Notably, Kiyosaki remains one of Bitcoin’s most vocal bulls , maintaining that the asset could rally toward a $1 million price target. He believes Bitcoin will outperform traditional assets amid the ongoing devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Kiyosaki’s perspective is rooted in his long-standing distrust of the dollar, which he refers to as “fake money,” and his broader support for alternative assets. As reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki has praised Bitcoin investors for rejecting the U.S. government and financial institutions, which he described as a “Den of Thieves.” He has also warned of a potential economic crash that could wipe out substantial wealth. In response, he continues to advocate for Bitcoin, gold , and silver as essential tools for preserving value. Kiyosaki regards Bitcoin, gold, and silver as equally important, dismissing the Bitcoin vs. gold debate as a distraction from deeper economic issues. All three assets have posted significant gains in 2025, even as the stock market, despite hitting new highs, has faced volatility. Featured image via Ben Shapiro’s YouTube . The post R.

2025-07-12T18:01:01,"New Banking Malware Hammers US and Canada, Reaches Over 50,000 Android Users in Just Six Days","A dangerous Android-based banking malware is rapidly spreading across the United States and Canada. Anatsa is capable of stealing banking credentials using various methods including overlay attacks and keystroke logging attacks, reports Threat Fabric. The banking malware can also conduct fraudulent transactions remotely from the infected Android devices. Threat Fabric says Anatsa is being distributed on the US Google Play app marketplace under various guises such as a PDF update, a file manager, a document viewer, a phone cleaner and other legitimate-appearing apps. Once installed, an update transforms it into malicious software. “Once the application gains a substantial user base – often in the thousands or tens of thousands of downloads – an update is deployed, embedding malicious code into the app. This embedded code downloads and installs Anatsa on the device as a separate application.” In the latest campaign, Threat Fabric says Anatsa was downloaded more than 50,000 times between June 24th and June 30th. Anatsa ranked third among the “Top Free Tools” category on the US Google Play app marketplace over that period. While Anatsa has been active since at least 2020 and has enjoyed consistently high levels of success, the mobile cybersecurity firm says this is the third instance where the banking malware is focusing on mobile banking users in the US and Canada. “The Anatsa malware campaigns continue to show a growing focus on North American targets, particularly mobile banking applications. The latest operation not only broadened its reach but also relied on well-established tactics aimed at financial institutions in the region.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-12T18:00:14,"Bitcoin Price Break Above $118,000 Just The Start, Analyst Unveils ‘Golden Number’","Bitcoin has rallied massively over the past seven days by posting an impressive price gain of nearly 9% after climbing from around $108,300 to almost $118,800. This move was quite surprising, particularly as the process saw Bitcoin clearing its previous all-time high from late May by breaking above $111,970. But according to Bitcoin technical analyst CryptoCon, this breakout may just be the beginning. In a recent post on the social media platform X, CryptoCon revealed a long-term cycle pattern that points to a more ambitious price target for Bitcoin. Analyst Unveils BTC’s Golden Number For This Cycle In a recent post on social media platform X, CryptoCon revealed a long-term cycle pattern that points to a more ambitious target for Bitcoin. His analysis is based on the 5.618 Fibonacci extension, which is a number he says has perfectly aligned with every prior cycle top. The projection opens up the possibility of whether Bitcoin’s current move marks the start of another parabolic run. Related Reading: Market Expert Says It’s Now ‘Illegal’ To Short Bitcoin, Here’s Why CryptoCon’s technical chart analysis builds on the recurring 5.618 Fibonacci extension level in previous market cycles. The analyst shows how Bitcoin’s previous tops have fallen within striking distance of this precise extension by measuring the move of each market cycle and applying this golden ratio. The chart shown below features the $30.84 peak in June 2011, the $1,205 top in November 2013, the $18,702 high from December 2017, and the peak of $63,839 in November 2021. Each of these market tops, as shown in the Bitcoin multi-year price chart below, converged on the same 5.618 multiple from their preceding bear market lows. Now, using this same approach in the ongoing cycle, CryptoCon projected that the next major step for Bitcoin is somewhere between $170,000 and $180,000. Particularly, the 5.618 Fibonacci extension points to a “Golden Number” of $184,181 for Bitcoin’s price in this cycle. Bitcoin Price Compression Is About To Expand Violently Several major forces appear to have contributed to BTC’s recent surge in the past 48 hours. A significant short squeeze earlier in the week reportedly wiped out over $1 billion in bearish positions. At the same time, US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered over $1 billion in daily inflows in the past two consecutive days. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Breakdown — Here’s The Best Time To Buy In his X post, CryptoCon also commented on the current state of Bitcoin’s chart: “All the boring price action is coming to a squeeze; it can’t stay that way forever.” This observation reflects the long period of tight, sideways trading between $105,000 and $108,000 that Bitcoin experienced in the previous two weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,762, retracing slightly after reaching its most recent all-time high of $118,667, according to CoinGecko data. Other crypto analysts now find themselves watching the $130,000 region as another zone of consolidation activity on the way to the possible cycle peak.

2025-07-12T17:55:24,"Bitcoin’s Record Quarter Met With Silence From Elite Media – Who’s Really Out of Touch?","Market intelligence firm Bitcoin Perception reported that mainstream media coverage of Bitcoin in Q2 2025 remained deeply polarized. A total of 1,116 articles were published across 18 major outlets, which demonstrated 31% positive, 41% neutral, and 28% negative sentiment. The firm highlighted a striking lack of coverage from elite financial publications, with The Wall Street Journal publishing just two Bitcoin articles, the Financial Times 11, and The New York Times 11. This is despite the fact that Bitcoin emerged as the best-performing asset of the past decade and saw billions added to corporate treasuries alongside record ETF volumes. Filling The Gap The report revealed that high-volume financial media such as Forbes, CNBC, and Barron’s provided extensive coverage and created a visible gap in narratives. Forbes, for instance, published 194 articles with 43% positive sentiment, particularly on retail and institutional adoption, with Bitcoin-related mining stories receiving 71.4% positive sentiment. CNBC published 141 articles with 42% positive sentiment, and highlighted Bitcoin’s role in banking, finance, and investment vehicles. Bitcoin Perception describes this coverage to be aligned with market developments rather than “institutional orthodoxy.” Meanwhile, Fortune published 117 articles with a balanced sentiment of 25% positive and 18% negative, and has maintained skepticism while covering Bitcoin’s growing role in the market. Barron’s published 65 articles with sentiment nearly split at 25% positive and 27% negative, showing a notable difference from its parent WSJ’s low volume. On the other hand, traditional news outlets such as The Independent and Fox News published 45 and 32 Bitcoin articles, respectively, maintaining a predominantly negative stance while still acknowledging Bitcoin’s relevance. The Independent recorded 42% negative sentiment, especially within crime, legal, and cybersecurity reporting, while Fox News maintained a conflicted narrative with 38% negative sentiment across similar topics. Ostrich Strategy Bitcoin Perception argued that the limited coverage from elite financial media reflects institutional reluctance rather than Bitcoin’s legitimacy issues, and framed this as an “ostrich strategy” that creates information asymmetry for institutional investors depending on these outlets for market intelligence. The report states that while the WSJ and FT provided minimal coverage of Bitcoin, other outlets documented significant developments in the digital asset economy. In the process, these outlets effectively replaced traditional financial media in informing investors about a key asset class. The disparity in coverage and sentiment, according to the report, indicates that as Bitcoin continues to outperform traditional assets, the “willful blindness” of elite financial publications contrasts sharply with the constructive, high-volume reporting from outlets like Forbes and CNBC, presenting both risks and opportunities for institutional positioning in the digital asset market.

2025-07-12T17:54:18,"Wall Street Firm Abruptly Upgrades JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, Says Upside Scenario Now Base Case for Big Banks","Boutique investment bank KBW believes JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are primed to witness higher prices as conditions conspire to favor large US banks In a new interview on CNBC Television, KBW head of US bank research Chris McGratty says the firm has upgraded its ratings for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley to outperform, with price targets of $327 for JPM and $160 for MS. According to McGratty, large banks are poised to benefit from easing regulations due to their scale-driven efficiency and consistent performance. “You are seeing a re-rating. This re-rating has been occurring for the past couple of months. Deregulation is being built into earnings estimate upside scenarios, blue skies, and the reality is that the upside scenario is becoming the base-case scenario. So you’re seeing the universal, the largest six banks, lead the charge. We’ve gotten a lot of positive news on deregulation, and that’s one of three themes with this launch is deregulation. The other two themes are scale and consistency, and any way you check it, the largest banks have all three under the relative winners.” As of Friday’s close, JPM is trading at $286 and MS is worth $142. Another banking giant on McGratty’s radar is Citi (C). McGratty says Citi may be the most undervalued stock among the group based on its return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a financial metric that measures how efficiently a bank is generating profits for its common shareholders. “If you think about their guide, their 10-11% ROTCE guide for next year, they took that down earlier this year. So the bar has been lowered. But if you look at where expectations are, we’re in the low to mid-9%. So there’s a big gap between low 9% and 10 to 11%. So if they can get that right, it’s the cheapest stock in the group. They’ve got a buyback catalyst. It’s very accretive when you can buy your stock back below 10 to a book value. And so this deregulatory environment for Citi is hugely helpful. The reason the ROE (return on equity) is so low is that the expenses have had to play catch-up. That investment phase is done, and so what the company is doing now is they are generating revenue. They are generating positive operating leverage across their businesses, and if they can get the macro to settle in a bit, this is a company I think we can re-rate quite a bit.” KBW is a New York-based firm known for its deep expertise in financials and bank stock coverage.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, according to S&P Global, together hold $172.28 billion in unrealized losses on their HTM securities as of March 31st. The high interest rate environment is weighing heavily on the value of the HTM securities and the downward trend in the value of the banks’ investments in these assets is unlikely to change soon, the financial data firm says. Bank of America had the highest level of unrealized losses on HTM securities at $96.35 billion, followed by Wells Fargo at $37.82 billion. JPMorgan Chase’s unrealized losses on HTM securities stood at $22.91 billion while Citigroup’s were at $15.2 billion. Among the Big Four lenders, Bank of America recorded the lowest decline year-over-year in the value of its HTM assets – a 6.2% decrease to $550.76 billion. “JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported the biggest year-over-year decline in HTM securities of 20.8% to $265.17 billion while Citigroup Inc. led with the biggest quarterly decline of 9.1% to $220.51 billion as of March 31. Wells Fargo saw a 12.2% decline year-over-year in its HTM securities balances.” The unrealized losses on HTM assets by the Big Four are emblematic of the industry, according to S&P Global. “Banks continue to sit on unrealized losses tied to bonds they purchased when institutions were flush with excess liquidity and interest rates were far lower. Increases in interest rates punished the values of many bonds that banks held while their funding costs moved higher, putting pressure on their net interest margins.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This update came straight from their latest report, Winners and Losers of 2025 , which put the crypto ahead of every fiat currency out there. The bank said Bitcoin has gained 18.2% since the start of the year, outperforming major players like the Swedish krona at +16.4%, the Swiss franc at +14.2%, and the euro, which came in at +13.2%. Meanwhile, the US dollar dropped 10.1%, landing dead last among the 14 asset classes they tracked.

Bitcoin surged above its 50-day exponential moving average, now at $106,434, breaking through key levels with real strength. Trading volume jumped at the same time, confirming what anyone watching the charts already knew, this wasn’t a weak rally. It was backed by actual momentum. The bank also flagged that Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) rose to 73.56, which signals overbought conditions. The last time RSI hit that level was in late May, when price hovered just under $110,000. Since then, it’s kept climbing. The structure on the charts shows higher highs and higher lows, and the fact that volume increased during the breakout gives it even more credibility. As of now, it’s sitting at the top of its historical range. As Bitcoin gained traction, traditional currencies struggled. Analysts at the bank blamed the dollar’s drop on weakening demand for dollar-based assets and growing doubts around where global interest rates are headed under the current administration. Investors are looking elsewhere, and Bitcoin has stepped in to fill that space. Bank adds list of undervalued stocks Outside of currencies, Bank of America pointed to several buy-rated stocks that they say have room to run. That includes Disney, Oddity Tech, Bellring Brands, AT&T, and Primo Brands. These companies showed enough upside, according to the analysts, to be listed alongside top-performing assets. Michael Funk, an analyst at the bank, brought AT&T back into coverage this week. He said, “Given the operational momentum in the business, strong combination of wireless and fiber assets and targeted return of capital over the next many years, we believe T should trade more closely to TMUS than VZ.” Michael thinks the company is “fundamentally sound, with a stable subscription-based business model.” AT&T shares are already up 19% this year. Yasmine Deswandhy, who covers Bellring Brands, said, “We believe the current share price undervalues BRBR’s historical sales growth delivery and potential runway.” She pointed to continued strength in health food trends, even with growing competition. “In our view, increased competition and recent changes in retailer buying teams are only natural in a young category and necessary for the category to expand out of the fringes and into the mainstream.” Despite being down 23% this year, she called the brand “built for endurance.” On Disney, analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote, “It appears now Experiences is tracking at least in line with FY25 expectations with the benefit of a robust pipeline of new cruise ships, which should buoy results in the years to come.” Jessica said short-term growth will likely come from a more profitable streaming business, better numbers from theme parks, and a film slate strong enough to drive other units. Disney stock is up 8% year-to-date. Primo Brands was included because of what analysts described as a strong consumer movement toward bottled water. The team gave it a Buy rating, saying the company is benefiting from favorable long-term demand and short-term synergy gains that help grow EBITDA. Finally, Oddity Tech stood out for its edge in tech. Analysts said, “We see opportunity for ODD to use its enhanced technological capabilities to capture share from legacy players.” The report mentioned 20%+ annual sales growth, with more growth expected from two new brand launches set for 2025 and 2026, aimed at expanding their reach to newer customers.

2025-07-12T17:12:45,"Trump’s 30% Tariffs on EU and Mexico Shake Bitcoin’s Bull Run","President Donald Trump’s latest tariff move is shaking up the Bitcoin and broader crypto market. After announcing a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union (EU) and Mexico, Bitcoin’s price took a sharp hit, falling below $118,000. The sudden drop came just after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high . This shows how quickly markets can react to global politics and trade news. It also raises worries that a new trade war could affect global markets and investor confidence. Crypto Market Turns Bearish After Trump’s Tariff News Goes Public Many posts on Truth Social say President Trump has sent official letters to the EU and Mexico. In the letters, he announced a new 30% tariff on goods coming into the U.S. from both regions. The tariffs will start on August 1 and are part of a larger trade plan already affecting other U.S. trading partners. The news quickly shook the crypto market. Before the announcement, Bitcoin had reached a new high of $118,200. However, soon after, the price dropped sharply. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,457, down by 0.40% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Analysts who were initially confident about a strong rise now think the top coin could keep falling as the market reacts. U.S Tariff Moves Continue to Pressure Bitcoin This is not the first time the crypto market has responded to Trump’s trade decisions. On July 7, he imposed 25% tariffs on imports from South Korea and Japan. He also sent tariff letters to 12 additional countries, each with different rates. That same day, Bitcoin fell below $108,000 before quickly rising again. By July 10, the digital coin had recovered and hit a new record above $112,000. The upward trend continued for a few more days, reaching $118,800 before dropping again due to the latest tariff news. Tariff Fears Could Trigger Broader Trade War While Bitcoin has shown resilience in recent weeks, Trump’s aggressive trade stance is creating uncertainty. The president warned that if other countries respond by raising tariffs on American goods, the U.S. will retaliate. Also, if the affected countries retaliate with their tariff hikes, the U.S. will respond with further measures. This growing tension raises concerns about a possible trade war, which could have far-reaching effects on both traditional and digital markets. Some investors are still confident in Bitcoin’s potential as a safe haven during global uncertainty. However, others worry that an economic slowdown and risk-off sentiment could push crypto prices down in the short term.

2025-07-12T16:57:28,"DWF Ventures Analyzes USDT’s Prospects of Dominating Competitive Stablecoin Market","Dubai, UAE, July 12th, 2025, Chainwire DWF Ventures, the venture arm of web3 investor and market maker DWF Labs, has released a comprehensive report exploring the future of stablecoins, with a spotlight on Tether's USDT and scaling solutions like Plasma and Stable. The analysis delves into the current state of stablecoins and how new purpose-built chains are poised to enhance USDT's global adoption by addressing compliance and scalability issues. In its stablecoin analysis, delivered in the form of an X thread, DWF Ventures examines the evolution of stablecoins, from synthetic dollars to digital payment solutions powering over $27 trillion in transfer volume, surpassing giants like Visa and Mastercard. It highlights how stablecoins now support use cases such as inflation hedging, global payroll, remittances, and consumer fintech. The report assesses the US Treasury Secretary's expectation of a $2 trillion stablecoin market by 2028, alongside recent milestones like Circle's IPO and the GENIUS Act. However, DWF Ventures identifies key inefficiencies in the current stablecoin ecosystem, including liquidity fragmentation across chains, lack of transparency, complex fiat ramps, and vulnerability to regulatory shifts. Issuers and adopters face chain dependency risks, volatile fees, and optimization gaps, particularly as over 80% of transactions occur on Tron and Ethereum. Tether dominates with a 62% market share and commensurate revenue, with USDT and Circle’s USDC accounting for 83% of transactions. This dominance has spurred new projects like Stable and Plasma, both backed by Tether, to optimize USDT for broader use cases such as payments, remittances, and enterprise DeFi. Stable is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 designed exclusively for stablecoins, featuring zero gas fees on USDT transfers and native USDT gas payments, DWF Ventures notes, making it the first standalone L1 to enable this. It unlocks low-cost scalability through features like bridging via LayerZero, native liquidity on Stable L1, built-in institutional compliance tools, off-chain sequencing, and a private mempool for enterprises. Plasma, an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain focused on stablecoins, has already hit a $1 billion deposit cap amid buzz around its upcoming XPL public sale. It emphasizes enabling scalable onchain merchant payments, remittances, commodity trading, and yields on stablecoins and Bitcoin. Key features include gas fees paid in whitelisted tokens with zero fees for USDT transfers, optional privacy via ZK or mixer protocols, and performance of up to 2K TPS with low latency. The report compares these solutions against Tron, highlighting shared traits such as the ability for USDT to serve as a native gas token as well as the availability of protocol-level compliance, but notes distinctions in network types, consensus mechanisms, and privacy features. While Tron excels in cross-chain bridging, high DeFi activity, and community governance, Stable prioritizes enterprise tools, and Plasma offers optional privacy and Bitcoin integration. DWF Ventures warns of ongoing challenges, including regulatory uncertainties and the need for better infrastructure to scale stablecoins into a foundational financial system. Yet it remains bullish, viewing Plasma and Stable not as replacements for USDT but as upgrades for faster and compliant global adoption. The analysis concludes: “Stablecoins as a whole aren’t just growing, they are forming and becoming the foundation for a new financial system.” DWF Ventures anticipates continued stablecoin growth and innovation and invites builders to connect for potential investments.

2025-07-12T16:55:14,"Florida Attorney General Probing Retail Trading Giant Robinhood for Allegedly Claiming To Be the Least Expensive Crypto Platform","Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has launched an investigation into Robinhood over allegations that the retail trading giant falsely promotes its crypto platform as the least expensive way to purchase digital assets. Uthmeier notes that Robinhood earns revenue by routing customers’ trades to third-party market makers in a payment-for-order-flow (PFOF) system. The state attorney general says Robinhood attracts customers by claiming to offer the “lowest cost on average” to trade crypto. Uthmeier argues, however, that Robinhood’s PFOF structure actually makes it more expensive than competing platforms that offer all-in trading costs. “When consumers buy and sell crypto assets, they deserve transparency in their transactions. Robinhood has long claimed to be the best bargain, but we believe those representations were deceptive.” The attorney general says third-party market makers that pay Robinhood for order flow sometimes have to charge worse prices to be profitable. Uthmeier issued a subpoena, asking Robinhood for organizational documents, employee information, advertising history, disclosures made to users related to fees, pricing documents, PFOF information, documents related to the sale of customer data, and information regarding Florida users specifically. Robinhood’s crypto division is required to respond to the subpoena by the end of the month, according to the attorney general.

2025-07-12T16:48:14,"Another BTC Mining Firm Moves Into Ethereum Reserve, Hailing ETH as ‘Digital Gold’","Bitcoin mining firm, BTC Digital (BTCT), has moved $1 million of company cash into ether (ETH), which it called its new “digital gold.” BTCT Moved $1M Into Ethereum Reserve, chief executive officer Siguang Peng said in a press release, adding that Ethereum has “emerged as the foundation of on-chain USD settlement and value transfer.” ""By securing an initial $1 million ETH reserve today—and with plans to scale that position—we are proactively positioning ourselves for decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and asset tokenization,” Peng said. BTCT plans to grow the reserve as upgrades lift capacity and U.S. rules solidify. BTC Digital was previously a bitcoin mining company. The firm recently said that ""its 20 MW large–scale cryptocurrency mining project in Georgia has reached a significant milestone."" The company doesn't state if it still plans to mine bitcoin, but said it is ""building on its origins in large–scale crypto mining, BTCT is undergoing a strategic evolution from ""hash–rate provider"" to ""on–chain financial infrastructure participant,"" in the press release. BTC Digital is the second publicly traded bitcoin miner turning to an ether treasury. Earlier this month Bit Digital (BTBT) shifted its entire treasury from BTC to ETH as it moved to a staking strategy. The move saw its stock jump up to 30%. It has since corrected in a nearly 20% drop. Meanwhile, BTCT's stock closed Friday's trading session 13% higher.

2025-07-12T16:30:34,"Injective Launches Strategic Council With Google Cloud And Deutsche Telekom","Injective is back in the spotlight after posting a remarkable 27% surge since last Wednesday, joining a broader market awakening as crypto momentum accelerates. The rally comes as Bitcoin hits new all-time highs and altcoins begin to reclaim critical levels, signaling growing investor confidence across the board. However, it’s not just price action fueling Injective’s breakout. On Friday, Injective announced the launch of the Injective Council—a strategic body composed of influential leaders from Fortune 500 companies and top Web2 organizations. This council marks a pivotal step in their mission to bring real-world adoption to the blockchain. The group will focus on accelerating institutional integration, driving innovation across DeFi, and guiding the platform’s evolution toward global asset tokenization. The announcement was met with optimism from the community and investors alike, who see the council as a sign of serious long-term vision. Injective is positioning itself at the intersection of legacy finance and cutting-edge Web3 infrastructure. Injective: New Era Of Institutional Web3 Integration The project has taken a bold step toward bridging traditional finance and decentralized innovation with the official launch of the Injective Council . This influential body is composed of elite organizations, including Google Cloud, Deutsche Telekom, BitGo, Republic, Galaxy, NTT Digital, and Korea Digital Asset Custody (KDAC). Together, these founding members bring decades of combined institutional, technological, and financial expertise to shape its future. The Council is designed to position Injective as the premier platform where institutional finance converges with Web3 infrastructure. By establishing a formal framework for collaboration, the blockchain team opens the door to meaningful integration between onchain systems and enterprise-grade use cases. Each member will play an active role in steering the protocol’s evolution, providing early insight into Injective’s roadmap while directly shaping priorities and governance decisions. Google Cloud brings scalability and infrastructure expertise to power Injective’s next growth phase. Meanwhile, Galaxy and BitGo contribute critical experience in asset management, custody, and tokenization, helping to build a foundation for real-world financial products like tokenized stocks, credit markets, and structured products. Republic and NTT Digital further broaden the Council’s global reach and regulatory perspective, strengthening Injective’s institutional credibility. The launch of the Injective Council isn’t just a milestone for the protocol—it’s a defining moment for the crypto industry as a whole, signaling that the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain is no longer theoretical. INJ Price Tests Key Resistance Injective (INJ) has shown renewed bullish momentum, gaining over 27% since last Wednesday and closing the latest candle at $12.75. The 3-day chart reveals a clean rebound off the red 200-period moving average, which has provided dynamic support for several weeks. This bounce coincides with a surge in trading volume, signaling increasing investor confidence. INJ is now testing the $12.75–$13 resistance range, a level that previously acted as support during mid-2023 and resistance throughout the second quarter of 2025. A confirmed breakout above this area could open the door for a move toward the 100-period SMA near $16.65, followed by the psychological $20 level. The convergence of all major moving averages (50, 100, 200) above price highlights that INJ remains in a broader bearish structure. If bulls can reclaim the 50-SMA at $11.06 as support and close above $13 with strong volume, the chart structure would favor a mid-term bullish continuation.

Key Takeaways: US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $1 billion in inflows for two consecutive days for the first time. BlackRock’s IBIT dominated Friday’s inflows with $953 million. Analysts warn that such high inflows may not be sustainable at current Bitcoin price levels. On Friday, 11 spot Bitcoin ETF products reported combined inflows totaling $1.03 billion, following $1.17 billion the previous day, according to Farside data . BlackRock’s IBIT accounted for the lion’s share of the inflows, attracting over $953 million on Friday. Only Seven Days of $1 Billion+ Inflows Recorded Since ETF Launch Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, noted in an X post that since the launch of these ETFs, there have been only seven days with inflows exceeding $1 billion. Notably, two of those occurred in the last two days. The previous high was $1.07 billion on January 17, 2024. The $1.17 billion inflow on Thursday was the second-largest daily figure since inception, surpassed only by the $1.37 billion inflow on November 7, 2024, the day of Donald Trump’s US presidential election victory. Matt Hougan, Bitwise Invest’s chief investment officer, highlighted that while the Bitcoin network produced roughly 450 BTC on Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs bought about 10,000 BTC. Similarly, blockchain analytics firm Jan3 noted that on Wednesday, Bitcoin ETF demand was 22 times greater than the daily mined supply. However, Jan3 CEO Samson Mow cautioned that such demand is unlikely to be sustainable at current price levels. This demand is not sustainable at these price levels. https://t.co/JkzZVPFo08 — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 11, 2025 The strong demand contributed to $2.72 billion in inflows over the past five trading days. Bitcoin’s price surged to new all-time highs, reaching $112,000 on Wednesday and climbing further to $118,780 on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. The price rally helped BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) surpass $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) on Thursday. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called it the “fastest ETF” to reach this milestone, achieving it in just 374 days. Recently, BlackRock reported earning more revenue from IBIT than from its flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. Balchunas added that total assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed $140 billion for the first time, largely driven by the recent price surge. As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. Institutional Bitcoin Demand Shifts From ETFs to Corporate Treasuries Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. Japan’s Metaplanet recently bought $237 million worth of BTC , becoming the fifth-largest corporate holder with a stack exceeding 15,500 BTC. France’s The Blockchain Group and the UK’s Smarter Web Company also made new BTC treasury allocations this week, purchasing $12.5 million and $24.3 million worth of Bitcoin respectively. Remixpoint, a Tokyo-listed firm, raised $215 million to fund a planned accumulation of 3,000 BTC.

2025-07-12T16:02:50,"ETH hitting $3k ignites alt season sentiments","Ethereum treasury company Sharplink Gaming has acquired another 21,487 ETH worth $64.24 million. The company bought the ETH in over-the-counter (OTC) deals within six hours through Galaxy Digital and Coinbase Prime. This follows its recent purchase of 10,000 ETH from the Ethereum Foundation for more $25 million through an OTC deal, continuing the company’s buying spree. According to crypto analyst Ember CN , the firm has 253,000 ETH with an average purchase price of $2,647. Sharplink, a gaming company, before it pivoted to crypto by establishing an Ethereum Treasury in early June, has Consensys Chairman and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin as its chairman. Although the company initially raised around $425 million to buy ETH, it has already spent over $600 million on acquiring Ethereum in less than two months, contributing significantly to buying pressure around the asset. Its decision to adopt the ETH treasury could not have come at a better time, with the asset seeing sizable gains over the past few weeks, enough to make the Sharplink portfolio turn profitable. With ETH gaining 17.75% in the last seven days and briefly crossing $3,000 for the first time since February 2025 before dropping to the $2,900 range, the company is now sitting on unrealized profits. Per Ember_CN, the firm has over $79 million in profits at the current ETH price. Sharplink stock outperforms ETH since the first acquisition Even more interesting is how Sharplink (SBET) has been performing relative to ETH since the company adopted the ETH treasury. According to CryptoQuant , SBET is up 486% since Sharplink first invested in ETH. By comparison, ETH has only been 17% since then. Sharplink stock value has quadrupled since adopting ETH Treasury (Source: CryptoQuant) Interestingly, this is not unique to Sharplink and ETH. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) stock MSTR has performed relatively better than Bitcoin. According to Yahoo Finance data, BTC is up only 24.75% this year while MSTR is up 44.86%. Unsurprisingly, the company stock is trading at a premium to the ETH it holds. With a market cap of $1.55 billion, the value of ETH backing each SBET stock based on its current ETH holdings is only 0.00353 ETH, worth around $10.40 at current prices. This is far below the $21.5 share value. However, the recent gains of Sharplink stock are a welcome development given that the shares are still trading far below their peak. SBET peaked in May at $124 and has fallen significantly since then, with its registration of shares filing a few months ago even part of the factors contributing to that decline. Meanwhile, the company is now the largest holder of ETH after its latest purchase, which took it above the Ethereum Foundation holdings of 242,489 ETH. ETH hitting $3k ignites alt season sentiments The $3,000 mark represents a significant price level for Ethereum, both psychologically and financially. According to Santiment , 124.13 million of the total 155.04 million ETH in existence are at a higher price at this level than when they first originated. This means that 4 out of every 5 ETH tokens are in profit above $3,000. Meanwhile, many believe the altcoin season might be on the way, noting the sustained ETH performance over the past few weeks that has allowed the token to wipe off most of its losses this year. There were further signs of interest with ETH futures flipping that of BTC a few days ago, according to Glassnode data, with a 24-hour volume of $62.1 billion compared to the $61.7 billion. The drop in Bitcoin dominance from 66% to 64.5% has also contributed to this sentiment. ETH exchange-traded funds have also started attracting massive volume, with $1.10 billion in net inflows into the products in July. The month is now on track to become the second-best month for ETH ETFs since its launch in 2024 and is already third, only a few hundred million behind June 2025, which had $1.16 billion, and over a billion behind December 2024 with $2.08 billion.

2025-07-12T15:49:07,"Number of XRP Whales at All-Time High, Ethereum Whales at Threshold Not Seen Since 2017 – What’s Happening? Here’s What Analysts Say","Cryptocurrency analysis firm Santiment released a compelling analysis of market dynamics in its latest report. Warnings range from Ethereum whales to the memecoin craze, from XRP volatility to signals of altcoin season. According to data from Santiment, large wallets holding more than 10,000 ETH hold 75.74% of the Ethereum supply, the highest level since May 2017. The company considers this increase a long-term bullish signal. While Bitcoin remains in the headlines, Ethereum is quietly gaining attention as it approaches the $3,000 mark. Social media optimism surrounding ETH is high. However, Santiment analyst Brian warns that this overwhelming positive sentiment could be counterproductive in the short term. Related News: Big Crypto Whales Make Big Trades as the Market Rises - Here's What They Trade According to the analytics firm's report, memecoins were the cryptocurrency sector that rose the most last week. Brian highlighted this area, which led the way with an average increase of 17%, arguing that this could be a sign of market saturation and a potential peak approach. According to Santiment, the number of wallets holding one million XRP or more has reached an all-time high of 2,743. At the same time, the total amount of XRP held by these whales is also increasing. This double-edged surge is considered a strong bullish signal for XRP. Santiment's data reveals that many altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. However, the sustainability of this trend depends on Bitcoin's stability above the $110,000 level, which the company stated is a critical threshold for the altcoin market. While the week ended on a strong note, the next few days will be the true test of the market. Analysts predict Monday, in particular, will reveal whether the crypto market can maintain its momentum. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-12T15:26:51,"Binance Crushes Rivals: Grabs 37% of Global BTC Spot Volume in H1 2025","Binance led global BTC spot volume in the first half of 2025. CryptoQuant’s latest analysis revealed that the crypto exchange commanded more than 37% market share, which is equivalent to over $3.44 trillion in traded volume. This significant lead evidenced Binance’s position as the primary hub for Bitcoin liquidity and major flow activity, as volume spikes and large trades often appear there first. Competitors Lag Behind Other prominent platforms such as Bybit, Crypto.com, Coinbase, and OKX collectively accounted for around 29% of total spot volume during the same period. Together, they formed the next tier of liquidity centers despite the wide gap with Binance. Meanwhile, crypto exchanges such as Upbit, Bitget, and HuobiPro each hovered around the 5% mark. While they did maintain relevance in the global market, but had comparatively lower influence, as noted by CryptoQuant. On the other hand, Kraken, KuCoin, and Gate.io, among other long-tail exchanges, each contributed less than 3% of total BTC spot volume and largely served niche or regional markets. “Bottom line: If you’re looking for deep liquidity or want to track major BTC flow activity, Binance is still the primary exchange (by far).” Beyond its spot volume share, Binance also dominates in whale activity. Bitcoin Whales Won’t Leave Binance In fact, CryptoQuant found that Binance has been leading in cumulative whale transaction flows across centralized exchanges. The exchange recorded a whopping 31.36 million BTC in whale inflows and 30.82 million BTC in outflows. This reflected not the total BTC supply but the sheer velocity and frequency of whale-sized movements (≥1000 BTC/day) over its operational lifespan. Spread across 2,869 active days of whale inflows, Binance has facilitated over 53.2 million whale transactions. It has dwarfed competitors with 10 times Kraken’s activity and five times that of HTX. This massive two-way flow indicates Binance’s role not merely as a custody hub but as a trusted venue for large-scale, active trading, market-making, and arbitrage operations, confirming its depth and infrastructure as reliable for whales. For context, HTX Global follows with 24.1 million BTC in inflows across 6.8 million whale transactions, while Kraken recorded 23.7 million BTC in inflows with 765,000 whale transactions. Other notable platforms include Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Gemini, OKX, and Poloniex, but none match Binance’s scale.

2025-07-12T15:22:05,"Why Is XRP Pumping? Whale Moves $90M as Ripple Price Nears $3","TL;DR XRP jumps 80% from April lows as whales move over $200 million in large transactions. ETF volume surges 5x above normal as traders await ProShares’ XRP futures fund launch. XRP nears $3 as traders speculate on $4 breakout amid revived momentum and whale activity. XRP Hits Five-Month High After 80% Climb XRP has surged nearly 80% from its April lows and shot up to almost $3 for the first time in several months. The token has increased by 8% in the last 24 hours and 25% weekly, making it one of the strongest assets in the market this week. Interestingly, the rally also marks a Bitcoin (BTC) breakout to a new record of $118,800, assisting in pushing up wider crypto prices. XRP has gained renewed momentum after months of muted movement, drawing fresh interest from both retail and institutional traders. Whale Transfers Fuel Speculation On-chain data shows several large XRP movements over the past 24 hours. Whale Alert flagged a 33 million XRP transfer (worth about $90 million) from Upbit to an unknown wallet. Another 40 million XRP, valued at over $100 million, moved between unidentified addresses, as CryptoPotato reported . In a separate transfer, 25.49 million XRP were sent from a private wallet to Coinbase. The cause behind such transactions is not clear, but these movements are likely to precede or follow price action. The timing has added to ongoing market speculation around the asset’s next move. XRP ETF Volume Spikes Ahead of Key Deadlines Trading activity has also picked up in XRP-linked exchange-traded products. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noted a sharp increase in volume. “The XRP ETFs seeing surge in volume today, like 4-5x the norm,” he posted. The 2x leveraged XRP fund ($XXRP) rose 27% on the day and 55% this week, with volume hitting $120 million. The XRP ETFs seeing surge in volume today, like 4-5x the norm, especially the 2x one $XXRP , which is up 27% today, 55% this week with $120m in volume..

These include Ultra XRP, UltraShort XRP, and Short XRP funds. The launches depend on whether the SEC allows them to proceed without objection before deadlines later this month. Traders continue to watch the charts closely. Edoardo Farina, a crypto educator, said , “It wouldn’t be surprising if market participants woke up to see XRP trading above $4.” XRP has remained below its all-time high for over seven years, but current momentum has revived market expectations for a breakout.

2025-07-12T15:17:47,"Strategy Stock: A Leveraged Way To Play Bitcoin","Summary I expect Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by October 2025, with MSTR as a leveraged way to outperform Bitcoin during this bull cycle. MSTR's massive Bitcoin holdings and AI-powered analytics offerings drive strong investor sentiment and could boost long-term profitability. MSTR is riskier and more volatile than Bitcoin, but buying near cycle lows and selling near peaks can maximize gains. For steady income, MSTY offers high-yield monthly distributions, but I prefer MSTR for higher total returns; both have unique risks to consider. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is beginning to break out of its recent consolidation period from the first few months of the year. This could be the beginning of the next significant leg higher for Bitcoin over the next few months. I'm holding to my thesis that bitcoin will reach at least $150,000 by approximately October 2025. I see Strategy ( MSTR ) as a leveraged way to ride this leg higher, as MSTR tends to outperform Bitcoin during these bull markets. For example, over the past 5 years, Strategy's price increased by 3,484% while bitcoin's price increased by 1,175% . My thesis for this bitcoin price target is based on a 10x price increase from this cycle's low of about $15,000 from the end of 2022. The 10x target is based on the 2.618 Fibonacci level, which looks like a reasonable target for this cycle. Bitcoin's price tends to make lower percentage gains from the bottom to the top in each cycle. Bitcoin's price increased over 20x in the previous cycle, with the peak in 2021. So, I'm conservatively going with 10x for this cycle as the total percentage gains may not be as high as in previous cycles. I'm also sticking to the thesis that Bitcoin's price will peak around October 2025 . This thesis is based on the consistency of the length in days of the halving cycles from the price bottom to the peak. In the last two cycles, bitcoin's price bottom to price peak lasted exactly 1,064 days. The first cycle lasted a little longer at 1,148 days. So, if the current cycle is consistent with the past 2 cycles, 1,064 days from the price bottom in 2022 should take us to October 2025. Significant Outperformance MSTR vs. Bitcoin Price Performance (weekly chart) (TradingView) Strategy's weekly chart above illustrates why MSTR can be a more leveraged way to benefit from bitcoin's rise. MSTR tends to significantly outperform Bitcoin during the bull phases of the halving cycle. So, if bitcoin is about to make another leg higher, then the Strategy is likely to do the same, possibly by a much higher percentage gain. What's Behind Strategy's Strong Investor Sentiment? Strategy has been making significant purchases of Bitcoin over multiple years. As of June 29, 2025, MSTR held 597,325 bitcoins . At the recent price of $118,000 per bitcoin, this equates to $70.5 billion. Strategy owns the most bitcoin of any other corporation (not including exchanges). MSTR considers Bitcoin as its primary Treasury reserve asset . Strategy's large bitcoin holdings are important because the company can profit from bitcoin's rise in price. Bitcoin tends to outperform the S&P 500 ( SPY ) over the long term. Therefore, MSTR's large bitcoin holdings may provide an investing windfall for the company over the long term if bitcoin's price continues to outperform the broader markets. As a result, investors bid up the price of MSTR in hopes that the company will have increasing value and profitability as the price of bitcoin increases over the long term. Another reason for Strategy's strong positive investor sentiment could be a result of the company being involved with artificial intelligence [AI]. AI-related companies have had positive investor sentiment in recent years. Every time period has certain popular investing themes, and AI represents one of the current themes that is driving positive investor sentiment in the broader market. Strategy offers AI-powered analytics software/services in the United States and abroad. MSTR's Strategy One product enables non-technical users with the ability to obtain actionable insights for making key decisions. MSTR also offers other AI-related products and services to provide insights for its users. MSTR's AI offerings have the potential to grow revenue and earnings for the company over the long term. Currently, MSTR is unprofitable. However, the company is expected to become profitable in 2027, according to analysts' estimates. What MSTR does have going for it is its high gross margin [GM] of 71% . This is significantly higher than the sector median GM of 50%. The company just needs to make a few key tweaks to its operational performance to produce positive operating income. MSTR's high operational expenses are due to bitcoin's impairment losses. The company currently has a deferred tax liability when the market value of bitcoin is lower than MSTR's cost basis on the reporting date. However, this can disappear if bitcoin's market value increases to a level that exceeds MSTR's cost basis. If MSTR keeps purchasing more bitcoin at current prices, the company may continue to have deferred tax liability at reporting time. This could change if Bitcoin's price rises at a faster pace than MSTR's cost basis. Another Option For Bitcoin Exposure If you are the type of investor who likes steady monthly income, then you can consider the Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ). This is a high-yield ETF that is currently paying a 127% annual yield based on the past 12 months of distributions. The distributions are paid monthly and vary based on how well the fund managers are able to implement the long/short strategy using derivatives such as options on MSTR. MSTY holds some U.S. Treasury Notes while implementing its options strategy. There is no guarantee that the yield based on the past 12 months of distributions will turn out as generous over the next 12 months. The price of the underlying MSTY tends to decline in value over time. Therefore, investors should consider the total return to evaluate MSTY as a holding for their portfolios. MSTY also has an expense ratio of 0.99%, which should also be considered. MSTR vs. MSTY MSTR vs. MSTY adjusted for distributions (weekly chart) (TradingView) The chart above shows MSTR's outperformance vs. MSTY. The chart includes MSTY's monthly distribution payouts. If MSTY's distributions are taken out, then MSTY's return would only be 1.41% over the same period. It all comes down to personal preference and the goals of investors, whether to own MSTR or MSTY. Personally, I would prefer to own MSTR over MSTY since I strive for the highest gain regardless of distribution payouts. However, I do understand that others may prefer the steady monthly distributions associated with MSTY. Perhaps others would prefer some combination of both. Risks for Owning MSTR and/or MSTY MSTR can be more volatile than Bitcoin. As a result, MSTR tends to lose more value than Bitcoin during the bear markets (after the halving cycle price peaks). This means that Bitcoin can outperform MSTR over longer periods of time (holding through bull and bear market cycles). Since bitcoin's bear markets lead to significant losses, I would prefer to sell near the peak price based on technical analysis to maximize gains. The losses during bitcoin's bear markets could be 70% to 80%. MSTR's losses could be even greater, at about 90%. This is why gains can be maximized by buying near the low points and selling near the high points. You may not be able to capture the exact bottom or top, but higher gains can be locked in with this strategy. The risk for MSTY is that the underlying price tends to decline over time. The high yield has compensated for this with the high monthly distributions. There is no guarantee that future distributions will be as generous as in the past. Therefore, it is possible that it could take longer to recoup your initial investment in the form of monthly distributions. It is also possible that the price behavior of Bitcoin is not consistent with the length of the previous cycles. It is possible that the current bull cycle will be shorter than previous cycles, which could catch investors off guard. Final Thoughts on MSTR I see MSTR as a viable way to profit from Bitcoin's rise. I would choose to do this methodically by buying near bitcoin's halving cycle bottom and then selling near the cycle peak. This can be done by looking at Bitcoin and MSTR's monthly charts with the RSI and MACD indicators, which show the key turning points at the tops and bottoms of the price cycles. I will be watching the price action for Bitcoin and MSTR through the next couple of months, anticipating the peak of this cycle to be around October. Also, MSTR's AI offerings could help increase sentiment for the stock if it leads to stronger revenue and profitability over the long term.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800857-strategy-stock-a-leveraged-way-to-play-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ZRX|MARKET","BTC-USD|MSTY|MSTR",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T15:15:53,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Attention as Bitcoin Hits 800K Daily Active Wallets","As Bitcoin price continues its explosive run—now boasting over 800,000 daily active wallets and trading around monthly highs—one new crypto project is quickly stealing the spotlight. While Bitcoin continues to show resilience and strength, market demand is shifting toward platforms that offer structured yield opportunities—particularly among whales and institutional-grade investors seeking strong returns in the long-term. Top analysts are now focusing on MAGACOIN FINANCE . With its presale stage now live and demand surging, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about new cryptocurrencies of Q3 2025. Audited by HashEx, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the top choices among 1% whales of the market. It is a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin which has become one of the best cryptos to buy now. Bitcoin Price Today: Surge Fuels Broader Market Interest Bitcoin’s recent surge came in response to easing tensions in the Middle East—particularly a surprise ceasefire between Iran and Israel—and a fresh wave of institutional inflows. Though prices briefly dipped below weekly lows during geopolitical flare-ups, the rebound was quick, and investor sentiment remains largely bullish. Adding fuel to the rally, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve , partially backed by Bitcoin seized by the U.S. government. While the announcement triggered short-term volatility (with a 5% dip), the market stabilized and quickly regained ground. Meanwhile, long-time “whale” holders have begun offloading Bitcoin, selling over 500,000 BTC . Institutions—ranging from ETFs to multinational corporations—are picking up the slack, helping reduce volatility and positioning Bitcoin as a long-term, stable investment asset. According to Standard Chartered , Bitcoin could climb as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025 , with long-term projections going up to $266,000 by 2030 . High-profile investors like Robert Kiyosaki and Elon Musk are fueling this momentum, with Musk rumored to be increasing his BTC holdings. And in a positive regulatory turn, the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act , offering clarity and legal groundwork for stablecoins—a move widely interpreted as a green light for broader crypto adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Heats Up, Gains Strong Demand Against this bullish market backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured the attention of thousands of traders, influencers, and crypto analysts. Currently in its presale , the project is seeing rapid buy-ins and rising prices , with many early rounds already sold out in record time. Key Highlights: Presale Live: Prices are increasing every few hours as demand soars. The presale is already attracting tens of thousands of wallet trackers, with higher-than-average purchase volumes per investor. Unique Narrative: Positioned as a political meme coin , MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into viral U.S. political culture with a capped supply of 170 billion tokens and a zero-tax model —a combination designed to attract both meme traders and serious investors. Strong Tokenomics: The project features no VC unlocks , strong anti-inflation mechanics , and has passed an independent audit by respected firm HashEx . Staking Rewards: An exclusive staking protocol is set to launch soon, offering high APY rewards for presale buyers—adding urgency to join early. Market Comparisons: Analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to early-stage breakouts like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE , but with a more focused narrative and cleaner tokenomics. It’s also being eyed as a high-upside alternative to coins like XRP, Solana , and Cardano , which are currently facing ecosystem challenges. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin thriving and institutional confidence at an all-time high, the broader crypto market is ripe for new breakout projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be one of those standout contenders—riding a wave of momentum with a unique meme-driven twist, strong tokenomics, and rapidly growing community engagement. That said, if MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers on its roadmap and secures key exchange listings later in 2025, it could be one of the biggest meme coin stories of the year.

2025-07-12T15:00:00,"Missed the Crypto Presale Boom? Bitcoin Solaris Final Phase Includes 48-Hour Price Rollback and 0.5 BTC Rewards","Crypto veterans know the feeling. You spot a presale, think it’s too early, wait, and suddenly it launches 20x higher. That moment of “I should have gotten in” echoes louder than any bull run cheer. But just when you think the train has left the station, Bitcoin Solaris is throwing open the doors with one last chance, and it’s not your average token sale. It’s the final phase of a high-velocity launch, paired with rewards that sound more like a Vegas prize pool. Bitcoin Solaris: A Wealth Machine with Speed and Substance Bitcoin Solaris, or BTC-S , isn’t just a clone with hopes and hashtags. It is redefining the architecture of crypto with a dual-consensus model that splits into a Base Layer (PoW) and a Solaris Layer (DPoS). The result? Raw security from Proof of Work, and next-level speed and scale from Delegated Proof of Stake. The numbers speak loudly: Base Layer runs SHA-256, ensuring compatibility with existing mining rigs Solaris Layer hits up to 100,000 TPS with a 2-second finality window Block times as low as 15 seconds, with dynamic block sizes up to 32MB 21 validators rotate daily, with slashing penalties for malicious behavior This system creates a balance between performance and decentralization. You’re not sacrificing one to get the other, and that’s exactly why so many eyes are on it. Beyond the Boom: Why This Final Phase Matters Most presales drag on or fizzle. Not Bitcoin Solaris. With over $6.6 million already raised and 14,150 unique holders, the project is accelerating into its final sprint. The launch price is locked at $20, but the current price remains at $11. And here’s the twist: for 48 hours only, BTC-S is introducing a Price rollback that brings the entry point back down to $5. This is not a bonus or gimmick. It’s a deliberate move to reward last-minute believers and onboard thousands more before listing. A rare chance like this is why crypto communities are buzzing. Wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch Over 14K users have already joined, making this one of the most explosive presales this year Crypto Show covered it in a detailed review, highlighting how BTC-S is blending tech, timing, and community perfectly This Rollback Is for You BTC-S Drops to $5 to Thank Early Supporters Real-World Utility, Built In Unlike many coins that promise use cases “later,” BTC-S is launching with a real roadmap and real applications: DeFi tools like DEXs, lending, and synthetic assets Enterprise use for identity, logistics, and data Gaming integrations, NFT support, and IoT compatibility Smart contracts built in Rust, borrowing Solana’s speed and flexibility Healthcare, education, and real estate utility out of the box Every application on BTC-S leverages the fast Solaris Layer while syncing data through the secure Base Layer. That means real-world functionality with technical muscle. A Different Type of Mining The upcoming Solaris Nova App is central to the BTC-S ecosystem. It turns mobile phones into micro mining hubs, enabling participation from anyone, anywhere. And with the built-in mining calculator at bitcoinsolaris.com/calculator , users can preview real yield potential in seconds. Energy-efficient system reduces waste by 99.95 percent compared to traditional mining Validator set updates are transparent and automated Public dashboards and quarterly reports bring unmatched clarity to the network Tokenomics That Actually Make Sense Bitcoin Solaris follows a fixed-supply model capped at 21 million BTC-S, just like Bitcoin, but with smarter allocation. Here’s a quick snapshot: 66.66% allocated for mining over 90 years 20% for presale 5% to liquidity 2% each for ecosystem, community rewards, staking, and marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This structure means real scarcity, real distribution, and none of the pump-and-dump inflation we’ve seen plague other coins. Play to Win: 0.5 BTC and Daily Rewards Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just technical muscle. It’s fun, too. The Blockchain Gaming system allows every token holder to earn while engaging: Daily free spins with no purchase required Spend-based spin tiers with real rewards Up to 13% token bonuses, and one lucky tier offering 0.5 BTC No need to stake or lock funds to play Adds excitement, retention, and unique community value It’s proof that utility can be profitable and fun at the same time. This isn’t just speculation. It’s a strategy with rewards. Final Verdict: The Last Chance That Doesn’t Feel Like One Missed Ethereum under $10? Ignored Solana before it hit $1? You’re not alone. But here’s the curveball: Bitcoin Solaris is offering one last low-price entry with the 48-hour rollback, while also stacking technical innovation, real use cases, and direct rewards. This is not just the end of a presale. It might be the beginning of your biggest crypto win yet.

2025-07-12T15:00:00,"Bitcoin SOPR Signals More Gains Ahead Despite New ATH – Analyst","In the past week, Bitcoin has grabbed the major headlines as prices surge to a new all-time high of $118,856 following a market gain of 9.77%. In remarkable fashion, the premier cryptocurrency added an estimated $10,000 to its market value increasing its market cap to a solid $2.34 trillion. Interestingly, recent on-chain data suggest there may be more tailwind ahead backing Bitcoin’s ability to explore new price territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $118,000—But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns STH SOPR Sits At 1.02, Suggests Market Not Overheating In a recent quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a market analyst with username CryptoMe has shared some compelling insights on Bitcoin’s price trajectory amidst current market euphoria. As earlier stated, the flagship cryptocurrency experienced a significant price gain to brush nearly against the $120,000 mark. Despite this rise, CryptoMe notes that short-term holders’ spent output profit ratio (STH SOPR) indicates that this class of investors are yet to engage in significant profit-taking. For context, The STH-SOPR measures the ratio of realized profits or losses by investors who’ve held BTC for less than 155 days. A STH-SOPR reading above 1.0 indicates that BTC are being sold at a profit, while values below 1.0 indicate losses. Based on the chart below, sharp increases in this on-chain metric especially into the 1.05-1.20+ range (red zone) have correlated with profit-taking phases and can often precede local tops. However, the STH-SOPR currently sits at 1.02, suggesting that although some short-term holders are in profit, no aggressive market distribution has commenced. This development is particularly bullish considering the STH realized price is presently at $100,000 indicating these investors are 17%-18% in profit and are opting to hold for further price gains. Meanwhile, the analyst notes that this present on-chain situation aligns with the broader sentiment in the derivatives market.

2025-07-12T14:20:12,"Bitcoin ETFs Record Back-to-Back Billion-Dollar Inflows Amid Price Surge","Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have marked a significant milestone, recording over $1 billion in inflows for the second consecutive day on Friday, a first since their launch in January 2024. According to data from Farside, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total of $1.03 billion in inflows on Friday, following $1.17 billion the previous day, reflecting a growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin amid a strong price rally. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, noted that billion-dollar inflow days have been rare since the ETFs launched, with only seven such days recorded so far—two of which occurred within the past two days. The previous high before this week was on Jan. 17, with $1.07 billion in inflows. Thursday’s $1.17 billion inflow marked the second-largest single-day influx since inception, surpassed only by the $1.37 billion recorded on Nov. 7, 2024, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Institutional Demand Outpaces Bitcoin Supply Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Invest, noted on Friday that while the Bitcoin network produced approximately 450 Bitcoins on Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased nearly 10,000 Bitcoins on the same day. Similarly, Jan3 emphasized that on Wednesday, Bitcoin ETF demand was 22 times higher than the daily mined supply, indicating the intensity of institutional demand. “This demand is not sustainable at these price levels,” said Jan3 CEO Samson Mow, suggesting that the heightened demand could continue to pressure Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. The strong inflows came during a trading week that saw Bitcoin prices hit new all-time highs , reaching $112,000 on Wednesday and climbing further to $118,780 by Friday, according to CoinMarketCap data. The rising prices fueled investor interest, leading to $2.72 billion in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs over the week. Bitcoin ETFs Cumulative Inflows Hit Records The price rally also propelled BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) to surpass $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) on Thursday, making it the fastest ETF to reach that milestone in just 374 days, according to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT fund now generates more annual revenue than its flagship S&P 500 ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, reflecting the shifting focus toward crypto among investors. Total assets across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs have now crossed $140 billion for the first time. While Balchunas noted that the recent price surge contributed significantly to these figures, the consistent inflows signal the strengthening role of Bitcoin ETFs in the financial markets as institutional interest in crypto assets continues to accelerate.

2025-07-12T14:19:28,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is a Correction Coming or Will BTC Break $120K Next?","Bitcoin has decisively broken above its previous all-time high of $111K, triggering a powerful bullish rally toward the key $120K psychological resistance. However, as BTC approaches the $120K zone, profit-taking and distribution pressure may rise, increasing the likelihood of a short-term corrective pullback. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart After a prolonged consolidation phase, Bitcoin has decisively broken above its previous all-time high of $111K. This breakout was backed by a notable surge in buying activity, triggering a short-squeeze that accelerated the bullish momentum. As a result, Bitcoin rapidly climbed toward the psychologically significant $120K resistance level. While this move signals strong market confidence, the $120K region is a probable zone for profit-taking and distribution, which could temporarily slow down the rally. A short-term corrective phase is therefore expected, likely pulling the price back toward the $111K region to retest the breakout level. Based on the Fibonacci retracement tool, key resistance levels ahead are located at $120K and $131K. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin printed a powerful bullish candle, decisively breaking above both the descending wedge pattern and the previous ATH at $111K. Following a minor pullback to retest the breakout zone, the price resumed its upward surge, reaching the $120K mark. Such impulsive rallies are often followed by short-term corrections, as traders begin to realize profits. A healthy retracement would likely target the 0.5 ($113K) to 0.618 ($111K) Fibonacci levels, a key zone where the market may stabilize and build momentum for the next leg up. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets As Bitcoin trades at all-time highs near $120K, an intriguing insight emerges from the Short-Term Holder SOPR metric. This indicator, which measures realized profits from investors who’ve held BTC for less than 155 days, remains notably muted, especially when compared to November 2024, when Bitcoin first reached $111K. Despite the recent surge, short-term holders aren’t cashing out aggressively, indicating that profit-taking is still relatively limited. Historically, the end of a bullish cycle is often accompanied by elevated SOPR values due to massive profit realization. But for now, the data suggests the market isn’t overheated, and the current rally could still have room to grow if new demand enters.

2025-07-12T14:15:03,"CKpool rolls out low-latency pool after solo miner racks up 3.175 BTC reward","CKpool developer and administrator Con Kolivas announced on X the launch of a new solo BTC pool located in Brisbane, Australia. The goal of this Bitcoin mining pool is to service Oceania and Asia-Pacific miners. The new AU solo pool is separated from the main CK pool and the EU solo BTC mining pool due to latency and performance reasons. As per the X post , the AU BTC pool will operate with low latency. Con Kolivas stated that blocks generated from the AU BTC mining pool will be propagated between other sibling pools. Moreover, the AU BTC blocks will carry the same signature from the main CK pool but with the prefix “ckpoolau.” The developer clarified that miners will have the option to utilize other sibling pools for backup. The main solo CK pool covers most of the world, but with relatively lower latency. AU pool is likely Bitaxe dominated Con Kolivas predicted that the AU pool will comprise mostly of Bitaxe mining rigs. He also predicted that the AU pool will have the lowest hashrate compared to other solo CK pools. This is due to high electricity costs in Australia. Currently, the average cost of residential electricity in Australia is AUD 33 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while commercial electricity costs between AUD 25 and AUD 45 cents per kWh. In the United States, the average residential electricity rate is USD 12.89 cents per kWh (AUD 19.6 cents), compared with AUD 33 cents per kWh in Australia . This is 60% of what Australians pay for each kilowatt-hour of electricity. The average Bitaxe rig hashrate ranges between 0.4–1.2 Terahash (TH/s). This means the electricity costs in Australia for running a Bitaxe solo miner will be AUD 16 cents per day at the average residential rate of AUD 33 cents, and between AUD 12 cents and AUD 22 cents per day at commercial rates of AUD 25 to 45 cents per kWh. While the daily costs seem minimal, the chance of solving a Bitcoin block and winning the mining fees of 3.175 BTC will take 14,075 years based on calculations from SoloChance . A Bitaxe rig tends to sell for roughly USD 150 each, and committed hobbyists usually run a cluster of 2 to 4 BTC rigs. Bitaxe Miner Solo Bitcoin miner racks in 3.175 BTC with 200 Ph/s Yesterday, Con Kolivas congratulated a solo miner for winning 3.175 BTC after solving block number 904,989. The miner solved the 302nd solo block with a huge hashrate of 200 petahashes per second (Ph/s). Con Kolivas wrote, “A miner of this size would solve a block once every ~35 days on average at current mining difficulty.” He further clarified that a miner of this size is probably renting hashrate. This is because the high hashrate of 200 Ph/s is much higher than the hashrate of available mining hardware. The developer said that this miner started mining Bitcoin on January 9, 2025. That’s around 7 months only. In 2017, Con Kolivas opened a shared Bitcoin mining pool with zero fees . The pool provided instant coinbase payment to miners. The developer created the pool as a service for the community. However, he shut it down in 2020 because it failed to attract enough hashrate to stay running.
