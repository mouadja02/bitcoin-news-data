2025-07-12T14:20:12,"Bitcoin ETFs Record Back-to-Back Billion-Dollar Inflows Amid Price Surge","Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have marked a significant milestone, recording over $1 billion in inflows for the second consecutive day on Friday, a first since their launch in January 2024. According to data from Farside, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total of $1.03 billion in inflows on Friday, following $1.17 billion the previous day, reflecting a growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin amid a strong price rally. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, noted that billion-dollar inflow days have been rare since the ETFs launched, with only seven such days recorded so far—two of which occurred within the past two days. The previous high before this week was on Jan. 17, with $1.07 billion in inflows. Thursday’s $1.17 billion inflow marked the second-largest single-day influx since inception, surpassed only by the $1.37 billion recorded on Nov. 7, 2024, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Institutional Demand Outpaces Bitcoin Supply Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Invest, noted on Friday that while the Bitcoin network produced approximately 450 Bitcoins on Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased nearly 10,000 Bitcoins on the same day. Similarly, Jan3 emphasized that on Wednesday, Bitcoin ETF demand was 22 times higher than the daily mined supply, indicating the intensity of institutional demand. “This demand is not sustainable at these price levels,” said Jan3 CEO Samson Mow, suggesting that the heightened demand could continue to pressure Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. The strong inflows came during a trading week that saw Bitcoin prices hit new all-time highs , reaching $112,000 on Wednesday and climbing further to $118,780 by Friday, according to CoinMarketCap data. The rising prices fueled investor interest, leading to $2.72 billion in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs over the week. Bitcoin ETFs Cumulative Inflows Hit Records The price rally also propelled BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) to surpass $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) on Thursday, making it the fastest ETF to reach that milestone in just 374 days, according to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT fund now generates more annual revenue than its flagship S&P 500 ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, reflecting the shifting focus toward crypto among investors. Total assets across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs have now crossed $140 billion for the first time. While Balchunas noted that the recent price surge contributed significantly to these figures, the consistent inflows signal the strengthening role of Bitcoin ETFs in the financial markets as institutional interest in crypto assets continues to accelerate.

2025-07-12T14:19:28,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is a Correction Coming or Will BTC Break $120K Next?","Bitcoin has decisively broken above its previous all-time high of $111K, triggering a powerful bullish rally toward the key $120K psychological resistance. However, as BTC approaches the $120K zone, profit-taking and distribution pressure may rise, increasing the likelihood of a short-term corrective pullback. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart After a prolonged consolidation phase, Bitcoin has decisively broken above its previous all-time high of $111K. This breakout was backed by a notable surge in buying activity, triggering a short-squeeze that accelerated the bullish momentum. As a result, Bitcoin rapidly climbed toward the psychologically significant $120K resistance level. While this move signals strong market confidence, the $120K region is a probable zone for profit-taking and distribution, which could temporarily slow down the rally. A short-term corrective phase is therefore expected, likely pulling the price back toward the $111K region to retest the breakout level. Based on the Fibonacci retracement tool, key resistance levels ahead are located at $120K and $131K. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin printed a powerful bullish candle, decisively breaking above both the descending wedge pattern and the previous ATH at $111K. Following a minor pullback to retest the breakout zone, the price resumed its upward surge, reaching the $120K mark. Such impulsive rallies are often followed by short-term corrections, as traders begin to realize profits. A healthy retracement would likely target the 0.5 ($113K) to 0.618 ($111K) Fibonacci levels, a key zone where the market may stabilize and build momentum for the next leg up. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets As Bitcoin trades at all-time highs near $120K, an intriguing insight emerges from the Short-Term Holder SOPR metric. This indicator, which measures realized profits from investors who’ve held BTC for less than 155 days, remains notably muted, especially when compared to November 2024, when Bitcoin first reached $111K. Despite the recent surge, short-term holders aren’t cashing out aggressively, indicating that profit-taking is still relatively limited. Historically, the end of a bullish cycle is often accompanied by elevated SOPR values due to massive profit realization. But for now, the data suggests the market isn’t overheated, and the current rally could still have room to grow if new demand enters.

2025-07-12T14:15:03,"CKpool rolls out low-latency pool after solo miner racks up 3.175 BTC reward","CKpool developer and administrator Con Kolivas announced on X the launch of a new solo BTC pool located in Brisbane, Australia. The goal of this Bitcoin mining pool is to service Oceania and Asia-Pacific miners. The new AU solo pool is separated from the main CK pool and the EU solo BTC mining pool due to latency and performance reasons. As per the X post , the AU BTC pool will operate with low latency. Con Kolivas stated that blocks generated from the AU BTC mining pool will be propagated between other sibling pools. Moreover, the AU BTC blocks will carry the same signature from the main CK pool but with the prefix “ckpoolau.” The developer clarified that miners will have the option to utilize other sibling pools for backup. The main solo CK pool covers most of the world, but with relatively lower latency. AU pool is likely Bitaxe dominated Con Kolivas predicted that the AU pool will comprise mostly of Bitaxe mining rigs. He also predicted that the AU pool will have the lowest hashrate compared to other solo CK pools. This is due to high electricity costs in Australia. Currently, the average cost of residential electricity in Australia is AUD 33 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while commercial electricity costs between AUD 25 and AUD 45 cents per kWh. In the United States, the average residential electricity rate is USD 12.89 cents per kWh (AUD 19.6 cents), compared with AUD 33 cents per kWh in Australia . This is 60% of what Australians pay for each kilowatt-hour of electricity. The average Bitaxe rig hashrate ranges between 0.4–1.2 Terahash (TH/s). This means the electricity costs in Australia for running a Bitaxe solo miner will be AUD 16 cents per day at the average residential rate of AUD 33 cents, and between AUD 12 cents and AUD 22 cents per day at commercial rates of AUD 25 to 45 cents per kWh. While the daily costs seem minimal, the chance of solving a Bitcoin block and winning the mining fees of 3.175 BTC will take 14,075 years based on calculations from SoloChance . A Bitaxe rig tends to sell for roughly USD 150 each, and committed hobbyists usually run a cluster of 2 to 4 BTC rigs. Bitaxe Miner Solo Bitcoin miner racks in 3.175 BTC with 200 Ph/s Yesterday, Con Kolivas congratulated a solo miner for winning 3.175 BTC after solving block number 904,989. The miner solved the 302nd solo block with a huge hashrate of 200 petahashes per second (Ph/s). Con Kolivas wrote, “A miner of this size would solve a block once every ~35 days on average at current mining difficulty.” He further clarified that a miner of this size is probably renting hashrate. This is because the high hashrate of 200 Ph/s is much higher than the hashrate of available mining hardware. The developer said that this miner started mining Bitcoin on January 9, 2025. That’s around 7 months only. In 2017, Con Kolivas opened a shared Bitcoin mining pool with zero fees . The pool provided instant coinbase payment to miners. The developer created the pool as a service for the community. However, he shut it down in 2020 because it failed to attract enough hashrate to stay running.

2025-07-12T14:10:10,"Bitcoin Dominance: Unveiling the Surprising Strength Amidst Altcoin Rallies","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Dominance: Unveiling the Surprising Strength Amidst Altcoin Rallies The cryptocurrency world is a dynamic realm, constantly evolving and often defying conventional wisdom. In a recent development that has captivated the crypto market, Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance has demonstrated remarkable resilience, holding firm despite significant surges across the altcoin landscape. This intriguing phenomenon challenges traditional market interpretations and raises a pivotal question: What exactly is driving this unique market behavior, and what does it signal for the future of digital assets? Bitcoin Dominance: Unpacking Its Enduring Grip For many seasoned observers, a drop in Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) has historically been a strong precursor to an “altcoin season”—a period where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin significantly. However, as crypto analyst Matthew Hyland pointed out, and as reported by Cointelegraph, the current scenario paints a different picture. Despite recent impressive rallies from various altcoins, BTC.D has not seen the expected dramatic decline. Data from TradingView indeed shows a slight dip of merely 1.53% last week, a relatively minor fluctuation given the substantial gains recorded by many altcoins. This steadfastness in Bitcoin’s market share suggests a robust underlying strength. It implies that while altcoins are attracting considerable attention and capital, Bitcoin continues to be the primary gateway and holding asset for a large segment of investors. This stability in dominance, even amidst a vibrant altcoin surge, is a crucial indicator of the overall health and maturity of the digital asset space. Decoding the Altcoin Season: Is This Time Different? Traditionally, an altcoin season kicks off when investors rotate profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, causing BTC.D to fall sharply. This current cycle, however, presents a compelling deviation. The altcoin rally has occurred concurrently with Bitcoin maintaining its strong market position. This simultaneous growth suggests that the market isn’t merely reallocating existing capital from BTC to altcoins. Instead, a more significant trend appears to be at play: the inflow of new capital into the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Consider this: if existing capital were simply moving from Bitcoin to altcoins, Bitcoin’s dominance would plummet. The fact that it hasn’t, even with altcoins posting double-digit or even triple-digit gains in some cases, strongly supports the theory of fresh money entering the market. This new capital is not exclusively flowing into Bitcoin, nor is it solely targeting altcoins; it’s expanding the entire market pie, allowing both segments to grow in parallel. New Capital Inflows: Fueling the Broader Cryptocurrency Trends The concept of “new capital” is pivotal in understanding current cryptocurrency trends. This could stem from various sources: Institutional Investors: Increased adoption of crypto by traditional finance firms, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. Retail Enthusiasm: A renewed wave of interest from individual investors, perhaps spurred by positive news cycles or mainstream adoption. Stablecoin Inflows: A rise in stablecoin market capitalization, often indicating sidelined capital waiting to be deployed into volatile assets. When new money flows into the market, it has the potential to elevate the valuations of both Bitcoin and altcoins. This broad-based liquidity can sustain rallies across the board, creating a more inclusive bull market where the gains are not zero-sum between BTC and its smaller counterparts. It’s a sign of a maturing market, where different segments can thrive simultaneously, rather than one at the expense of the other. What Does This Mean for BTC Price and Your Investment Strategy? For investors, understanding this dynamic is key. If new capital is indeed the primary driver, it bodes well for the long-term outlook of the entire crypto space, including the BTC price. A rising tide lifts all boats, and a continuous influx of fresh funds could push Bitcoin to new highs while also providing ample room for altcoins to flourish. However, it also presents a nuanced challenge: how to position your portfolio. While the “new capital” theory is optimistic, market dynamics can shift rapidly. A sudden decrease in new inflows or a rotation of existing capital could still impact dominance and altcoin performance. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors Given these unique market conditions, what steps can investors take? Monitor Bitcoin Dominance Closely: While it’s holding strong, a significant break below key support levels could still signal a more aggressive altcoin rotation. Diversify Wisely: Consider a balanced portfolio that includes both Bitcoin for its foundational strength and well-researched altcoins with strong fundamentals and innovative use cases. Research Beyond Hype: In a market fueled by new capital, it’s easy for less robust projects to get carried away in the general euphoria. Focus on projects with clear utility, active development, and solid communities. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and major industry developments that could influence capital flows. Practice Risk Management: As always, invest only what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital during volatile periods. A New Chapter for the Crypto Market? The current resilience of Bitcoin Dominance amidst surging altcoins is a fascinating development, hinting at a more profound shift in the crypto market. Matthew Hyland’s observation of new capital inflows provides a compelling explanation, suggesting that we might be witnessing a more expansive and inclusive bull market. This isn’t just a simple rotation of funds; it’s potentially a signal of growing mainstream adoption and increasing liquidity across the board. While the future remains unpredictable, this unique market phase offers exciting opportunities for investors who are prepared to understand and adapt to these evolving cryptocurrency trends. The stage is set for what could be a truly transformative period for digital assets.

2025-07-12T14:10:04,"Santiment Announces the Start of Altseason","Market data points to the beginning of the altcoin season, but there are worrying signals. This was announced by specialists at Santiment. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of over $118,000. Against this backdrop, most of the leading cryptocurrencies outperformed Bitcoin in terms of price performance over the past seven days. The largest Ethereum wallets (10,000 ETH or more) collectively own 75.74% of the coin's total supply. This is the highest level of concentration of the asset among whales since May 2017, and it acts as a ”powerful bullish signal,” the company's experts noted. The number of XRP wallets storing more than 1 million coins reached an all-time high of 2,743. The volume of cryptocurrency they hold has also increased. Both trends are a ”very positive sign” for the asset from Ripple, Santiment emphasized. Analysts estimate that the altcoin season will continue as long as Bitcoin holds above the key psychological level of $110,000. In such a situation, traders are comfortable redistributing profits from the growth of digital gold into other coins, they added. Experts advised remaining cautious The value of the MVRV metric for Bitcoin is one of the alarming signals. The ratio of market price to realized value of the asset has already surpassed the value recorded in May, which was followed by a correction after the previous all-time high. Santiment also drew attention to the leadership in weekly growth by the meme-coin segment—plus 17%. This potentially points to the concluding phase of the market rally, experts believe. ”When speculative assets lead the market, it could mean that greed is peaking,” they noted. For Ethereum, an alarming signal is the extremely optimistic sentiment regarding the asset. This usually indicates that a short-term price peak is approaching, Santiment said. CoinMarketCap's altcoin index is at 27. The value indicates that traders still favor Bitcoin. The dominance of the first cryptocurrency is 62.5%. Analyst Matthew Hyland noted that despite this, altcoins have shown impressive growth. However, the real rally will begin after Bitcoin's dominance is reduced to 45%, he believes.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9912/santiment-announces-the-start-of-altseason,"ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH","News|Altcoins",cryptocompare

Minnesota Vikings linebacker Dallas Turner was duped out of $240,000 by a scammer who seemed to have intimate knowledge of his account, reports the Star Tribune. Someone posing as a Chase banker called Turner and made him think his account was under attack. Authorities are asking Chase to determine whether bank employees are involved because the scammer “was able to obtain sensitive account details including Turner’s full name, linked phone numbers and [his] LLC account info.” The fraudster called Turner on February 19th, alleging an impostor was attempting a wire transfer. Turner, convinced of the threat, rushed to a Chase branch and wired $120,000 to “Island Food Truck LLC.” That same day, he visited a separate Chase branch and transferred $120,000 to “CNL FL LLC.” Police say they have several suspects and charges are pending. To date, around $2,500 of Turner’s cash has been recovered.

2025-07-12T14:00:32,"Analyst Shares Stellar (XLM) Next Move, Says Be Ready","Stellar Lumens (XLM) is gaining renewed attention following a bold technical analysis by crypto strategist Egrag Crypto. In a detailed chart shared via X, Egrag outlines a long-term bullish setup that suggests XLM is gearing up for a major breakout. With XLM currently trading around $0.395 as of report time, the technical and fundamental indicators appear to be aligning, prompting the analyst to issue a clear call to action: “Be ready.” Egrag Crypto’s Macro Chart: The Cup and Handle Formation Egrag’s chart presents a compelling long-term structure that spans nearly a decade. At the heart of the analysis is a massive cup and handle pattern, a formation often associated with powerful bullish reversals. The “cup” is defined by a rounded base stretching from 2018 to 2023, while the emerging “handle” forms the final phase before a potential breakout. #XLM – Next Move: Be Ready pic.twitter.com/bk6DmygYS6 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 11, 2025 According to Egrag, XLM has repeatedly bounced from a reliable diagonal support trendline, marking key accumulation zones along the way. Each previous bounce has led to significant rallies, and XLM’s current position suggests another move is building. The price is now approaching the upper boundary of this structure, signaling a potential breakout point. Egrag identifies three major upside targets: Target 1 near $0.45 Target 2 around $0.65 Target 3 extending to $1.11, with an ultimate Fibonacci extension near $1.51 With XLM currently holding above the $0.39 mark, the asset appears to be entering the breakout phase highlighted in Egrag’s forecast. Market Momentum: XLM Price Surges Past Key Resistance Over the past week, XLM has surged by more than 25%, outperforming many other mid-cap cryptocurrencies. The rally comes as Bitcoin soars past $118,000, lifting broader market sentiment. XLM’s breakout above the $0.37 resistance level has brought renewed confidence to traders, many of whom now see $0.45 as the next technical target. The price has also re-entered the upper zone of a multi-year ascending channel, adding further credibility to Egrag’s projection. If current momentum holds, a move toward the $0.65 and $1.10 zones may follow in the medium term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strengthening Fundamentals: Institutional Adoption and Soroban Egrag’s bullish outlook also coincides with a string of positive developments within the Stellar ecosystem. Notably, Franklin Templeton recently tokenized over $445 million in U.S. Treasuries on the Stellar network, marking one of the largest real-world asset integrations in crypto to date. Adding to the momentum, Stellar’s upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade, which will introduce Soroban, its native smart contracts platform, is set for release in August 2025. Soroban is expected to enable advanced DeFi capabilities and programmable assets, broadening Stellar’s utility and appeal to developers and institutions alike. Stellar Aligns for Breakout, Are You Ready? Egrag Crypto’s long-range analysis presents a technically and fundamentally supported case for a major move in XLM . With the price nearing critical resistance and institutional activity on the rise, Stellar may be on the verge of a breakout not seen since its previous cycle highs. While nothing in crypto is ever certain, the combination of historical support, bullish technical patterns, and real-world use cases makes one thing clear: this could be Stellar’s moment.

Cybercriminals stole approximately $140 million from six Brazilian financial institutions by using the credentials of a C&M Software employee. The incident occurred on June 30, when the attackers bribed João Nazareno Roque and gained access to the system using his credentials. According to police, he also relayed instructions to perform certain actions that ensured the attack's success. Roque initially received $920 for his involvement. Later, following the attackers' recommendations, he ran commands inside C&M's infrastructure and earned an additional $1,850, according to reports. Roque attempted to conceal his activities by changing cell phones every 15 days. However, on July 3, he was detained in São Paulo. It is estimated that at least $30–40 million of the stolen funds were converted into crypto-assets. According to an investigation by on-chain detective ZachXBT, the attackers converted the funds into BTC, ETH, and USDT through Latin American OTC and crypto exchanges. Basketball Player Suspected of Cyber Extortion On July 9, news emerged of the detention of Russian professional basketball player Daniil Kasatkin. According to media reports, he was arrested on June 21 at Charles de Gaulle Airport in France, at the request of U.S. authorities. The athlete is accused of acting as a negotiator in a hacker network that used ransomware. Kasatkin remains in custody, and U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition to face charges. His lawyer has declared the athlete's innocence. The name of the hacker group has not been disclosed. Between 2020 and 2022, the attackers reportedly carried out more than 900 attacks on various organizations, including two federal agencies. McDonald's AI Bot Vulnerability Led to Leaked Employee Hiring Database According to Wired, researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry discovered critical vulnerabilities in the McHire system on June 9. The platform, which hires employees for McDonald's, uses an AI bot named Olivia. Using simple passwords like ”123456,” the researchers gained access to the admin panel of the platform's developer, Paradox.ai. It contained a database with 64 million records, including job seekers' names, emails, and phone numbers. Since 2019, the platform had been accessible without two-factor authentication. Paradox.ai acknowledged the leak and stated that the account was not used by third parties other than the researchers themselves. The company promised to implement a bug bounty program to prevent similar incidents in the future. McDonald's, for its part, said it fixed the vulnerability the day it was discovered. Carroll said he only found out about this ”appalling level of security” because he was interested in the decision to vet potential employees through an AI bot and a personality test. ”It seemed particularly dystopian to me compared to the normal hiring process, right? That's what prompted me to dig deeper. I started applying for the job, and within 30 minutes we had full access to virtually every application form ever submitted to McDonald's in recent years,” he emphasized in a comment to Wired. Bitcoin Depot Failed to Keep Track of 27,000 Customers' Data Bitcoin Depot, an operator of a Bitcoin ATM network with more than 17,000 devices in the US, Canada, and Australia, has notified customers of a personal data leak.

2025-07-12T13:54:34,"Bitcoin’s Is Now Bigger Than Google and Silver: Amazon Targeted Next","The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has long expanded beyond its own industry and has maintained a place within the top largest assets by that metric for a while. Its latest price surge recorded earlier this week allowed it to create history by charting a new all-time high close to $119,000. Although this move has seen some resistance and BTC is now down by over a grand, its market cap has overtaken the second-largest precious metal and one of the most influential companies in the world. BTC Above Silver, Alphabet Who could have predicted such a development 15 years ago when a peer-to-peer electronic system was launched by an unknown creator? Or a decade ago when it was being ridiculed by countless traditionalists. Or even three years ago, when it had become more mainstream after a surge to roughly $70,000 but then crumbled under pressure to under $20,000 within months amid industry-wide wipeouts, scams, failures, and everything in between. Fast forward to July 2025, this same network, which was once a mere decentralized system for sharing value over the Internet, has become a global phenomenon. It has been adopted by countries, world leaders use it in their election campaigns, the largest wealth managers have launched ETFs tracking its underlying asset, and more. And speaking about that underlying asset, its price just made history this week by skyrocketing to a fresh all-time high (for the third time this year) at almost $119,000. Naturally, this pushed its market capitalization to new peaks of its own as the metric stands close to $2.350 trillion now (that’s a trillion with a T). Data from CompaniesMarketCap shows that this same asset, which was not that long ago worth pennies, has now become the sixth-largest global asset by market capitalization. Its most recent victims on the way up include Alphabet (market cap of $2.192 trillion) and silver ($2.2 trillion). Assets by Market Cap.

Gold remains the indisputed leader, with a market cap of well over $22.5 trillion. Where’s ETH? The second-largest cryptocurrency also experienced a substantial price revival this week, hitting $3,000 for the first time since February.

2025-07-12T13:50:22,"Swedish Bitcoin Treasury Capital: A Strategic Accumulation of 4.4 BTC Signals Confidence","BitcoinWorld Swedish Bitcoin Treasury Capital: A Strategic Accumulation of 4.4 BTC Signals Confidence The world of digital assets continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with traditional finance increasingly recognizing the long-term value proposition of cryptocurrencies. In a recent development that underscores this growing trend, Bitcoin Treasury Capital , a Swedish-listed company dedicated to holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset, announced another significant purchase. This time, the firm added an additional 4.4 BTC to its reserves, bringing its total holdings to 152 BTC as of July 11. This seemingly modest acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal of sustained confidence and a testament to the ongoing trend of institutional integration of Bitcoin into corporate balance sheets. Understanding Bitcoin Treasury Capital and Its BTC Accumulation Strategy Bitcoin Treasury Capital isn’t your average investment fund. It’s a company specifically designed to provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly listed entity. This unique structure offers a regulated and transparent way for individuals and institutions to participate in the Bitcoin market without directly managing the complexities of self-custody or navigating less regulated exchanges. Their consistent BTC Accumulation strategy, exemplified by this latest 4.4 BTC purchase, highlights a long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. Why do companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital opt for this strategy? Here are a few key reasons: Long-Term Vision: They believe in Bitcoin’s potential for significant appreciation over time, viewing it as a superior asset for treasury management compared to traditional fiat currencies, which are susceptible to inflation. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets beyond traditional stocks, bonds, and cash, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Institutional Appeal: By operating as a listed company, they offer a familiar and accessible entry point for institutional investors who might otherwise be hesitant to directly engage with the crypto market. Transparency: Regular announcements of their holdings, like the one made via X, provide transparency to their shareholders and the broader market, building trust and confidence. The Broader Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The move by Bitcoin Treasury Capital is part of a much larger and increasingly significant global trend: the adoption of Bitcoin by corporations for their treasury reserves. While pioneers like MicroStrategy famously led the charge, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC, a growing number of public and private companies are following suit, albeit often on a smaller scale. This shift represents a maturation of the Bitcoin ecosystem, moving beyond individual retail speculation to legitimate corporate financial strategy. Consider the impact of these Corporate Bitcoin Holdings : Validation of Bitcoin: Each company that adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet lends further credibility to the asset, transforming it from a niche digital curiosity into a recognized financial instrument. Increased Liquidity and Stability: As more companies hold Bitcoin for the long term, it can contribute to market stability by reducing the circulating supply available for short-term trading. New Investment Avenues: The existence of treasury companies creates new, regulated investment vehicles for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin without direct ownership. This trend is not without its challenges, including Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility and evolving regulatory landscapes. However, the benefits of potential long-term growth and inflation hedging are proving to be compelling enough for forward-thinking companies to embrace this new asset class. Sweden’s Progressive Stance: A Hub for Swedish Bitcoin Investment? It’s particularly interesting that Bitcoin Treasury Capital hails from Sweden. Sweden has a unique position in the global financial landscape, often lauded for its technological adoption and progressive approach to digital innovation. While the country’s central bank, the Riksbank, has been exploring its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-krona, its private sector has also shown a notable openness to decentralized digital assets. This environment fosters a fertile ground for Swedish Bitcoin Investment . The presence of a listed company like Bitcoin Treasury Capital suggests a level of regulatory clarity or at least acceptance that allows such ventures to thrive. This contrasts with some other nations where regulatory uncertainty can stifle innovation in the crypto space. Sweden’s digital-first mindset and high rates of digital payment adoption may also contribute to a greater understanding and acceptance of cryptocurrencies among its populace and businesses. Unpacking the Significance: What Does This Mean for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The consistent purchases by companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital are critical indicators of the broader movement towards Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . While 4.4 BTC might seem like a small amount compared to the vast sums traded daily, it’s the consistency and the underlying strategic intent that truly matter. It signifies that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset but is increasingly viewed as a legitimate component of a well-diversified corporate treasury. Key takeaways for the future of institutional adoption: Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: Institutions are actively seeking alternatives to traditional fiat and bonds, especially in an era of quantitative easing and inflation concerns. Growing Confidence in Custody Solutions: The rise of secure, institutional-grade custody solutions makes it safer for companies to hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. Maturing Regulatory Frameworks: As regulations slowly become clearer in various jurisdictions, it reduces risk and encourages more traditional financial players to enter the space. Educational Shift: There’s a growing understanding among corporate boards and financial managers about Bitcoin’s fundamental properties and its potential long-term value. Each new company, big or small, that publicly adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to a network effect, making it more acceptable and even expected for others to consider doing the same. This incremental accumulation by various entities builds a robust foundation for Bitcoin’s long-term integration into the global financial system. Conclusion: A Steady March Towards Digital Asset Integration The latest acquisition of 4.4 BTC by Bitcoin Treasury Capital , while a single data point, is a compelling piece of evidence in the larger narrative of Bitcoin’s journey into mainstream finance. It reinforces the idea that companies, particularly those with a forward-thinking approach, are increasingly comfortable with and committed to holding digital assets as part of their treasury strategy. This ongoing BTC Accumulation by entities like Bitcoin Treasury Capital from Sweden signifies not just a belief in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation, but a strategic decision to embrace a new paradigm of corporate finance. As more companies follow this path, the landscape of global treasury management will undoubtedly continue to transform, with Bitcoin playing an ever more central role.

Top Analyst Says Soo! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s native token, XRP, has just climbed to the third spot in the global crypto rankings, sitting right behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, with its market cap reaching $164.29 billion. At the same time, popular crypto influencer Alex Cobb has made a bold prediction, saying XRP could hit $22.54 by December 2025. But what makes him so confident that XRP can reach this level? Analyst Predicts XRP Price to Hit $22 In his recent post, Cobb used humor to send a serious message. He shared a meme showing XRP skeptics regretting their decision as the coin rises above $22.54. It was a playful way to say something clear, don’t ignore XRP’s potential. If XRP reaches that price, it would mean a massive 8X jump, or about 767% gain from where it is now. Such a rise could push XRP’s market value to around $1.32 trillion, possibly putting it ahead of Ethereum as the second-largest crypto. XRP sideliners in December 2025 when its $22.54 pic.twitter.com/bwwtnseUcv — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) July 11, 2025 Even veteran trader Peter Brandt, once critical of XRP, now believes it could hit a $502 billion market cap, and some believe it could go even higher. History of Proving Doubters Wrong This isn’t the first time XRP has shocked those who doubted it. Between November 2024 and January 2025, XRP surged by 7X, forcing well-known critics to rethink their positions. Even Davinci Jeremie, a die-hard Bitcoin fan, admitted XRP could climb past $20, recognizing the community’s strong push and Ripple’s progress. Whales Buying More XRP Recently, XRP whales have accumulated a massive amount of XRP. Right now, 2,743 wallets each hold over 1 million XRP, the highest number ever. These wallets now control nearly half of all XRP in circulation. Meanwhile, this big buying wave comes as XRP hit $2.80 after a strong 10% daily jump. The price spike also forced $31 million in short positions to close, catching bearish traders off guard. After hitting $2.97 , XRP pulled back but found support at $2.70. It’s now holding above $2.75. If buyers push it past $2.90 with good volume, XRP could reach $3.20 or higher soon.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-could-hit-22-by-december-2025-top-analyst-says-soo/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ETH","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T13:45:49,"Miners can't keep up with demand: The Bitcoin supply squeeze is getting real","While Bitcoin (BTC) rips through fresh all-time highs, climbing above $118K and $120K within reach, the metrics of the rally are getting far more complex than just bullish sentiment. On-chain data shows an emerging imbalance in supply and demand reminiscent of late 2020. BTC price is now up by 105% over the last year and leading the altcoins with massive bullish sentiments. The cumulative crypto market cap is nearing the $3.7 trillion mark with a 24-hour trading volume of around $163 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin dominance is on the high side of 64%, and the fear and greed index is flashing “Greed” among traders. Miners can’t keep up with demand As per the Glassnode data, wallets holding less than 100 BTC are now accumulating Bitcoin at a combined pace of 19,300 BTC per month. This number is already 6,000 more BTC than miners are issuing monthly (13,400 BTC). It added that this wide base of retail and high-net-worth holders is absorbing more than 100% of the net new supply. If some Bitcoin remains in the market, then ETFs , institutions, or treasuries are gobbling up the rest. Bitcoin balance on exchanges is also dropping, and the supply shock is getting real. Exchange balances are falling, long-term holders are growing, and miner issuance is unable to keep up. Long-term holders (LTHs) are absorbing more BTC than miners can mint, and they’re not even thinking about selling. Source: Coinglass The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for long-term holders is currently sitting at 0.69, which is below the threshold red zone of 0.75. In the last cycle, the market spent 228 days in the euphoria zone, and this cycle, just 30 days. Even short-term holders, the classic profit-takers, are yet to show any signs of dumping. Their average entry price is around $100,000, which means they’re sitting on 17-18% gains. Bitcoin boom turns corporate heads There’s the macro picture, which implies that Bitcoin isn’t just gaining in price, it’s gaining legitimacy. Institutional investors are leaning in while corporates are converting cash into BTC. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) turns out to be the poster child of corporate Bitcoin accumulation. It now owns nearly 600,000 BTC and holds a $28 billion paper profit. Only Satoshi and BlackRock hold more than MSTR. But unlike BlackRock, which holds BTC via its ETF ( IBIT ) on behalf of investors, Strategy holds BTC outright on its balance sheet. Saylor isn’t shy about it, and when BTC hit an all-time high yesterday, he posted: “The halls of eternity echo with the cries of those who sold their Bitcoin.” Other companies are riding the same wave. Japan’s Metaplanet owns over 15,500 BTC, now worth nearly $1.83 billion, up from $284 million. El Salvador, the original Bitcoin nation, now holds 6,234 BTC, valued at $733 million, with a $232 million paper profit. Semler Scientific (SMLR) has followed the BTC-on-balance-sheet strategy too. It hodls 4,636 BTC and $160 million in gains. France’s Blockchain Group is in the mix with 900 BTC, up $30.5 million on paper. This rally wasn’t isolated to Bitcoin. Ethereum broke the $3,000 mark again, and XRP, SOL, DOGE are all rallying with it. XRP price spiked by 25% in the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $2.78 at press time.

The President slapped 30% levy on the two trading partners, which will take effect from Aug. 1, according to letters Trump posted on his Truth Social account. ""Mexico has been helping me secure the border. BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,"" Trump wrote in a letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. In another letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump called the relationship with the EU far from reciprocal. Early this week, Trump issued new tariffs for several countries, including South Korea, Japan, Canada and Brazil, along with a 50% tariff on copper, triggering volatility in the market for the red metal. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded around $17,400 following Trump's announcement, down 0.6% from the European session high of $18,200.

The analyst suggested that this could be the final leg up for the foremost meme coin and advised market participants not to miss it. Dogecoin Eyes Parabolic Rally With Megaphone Pattern In a TradingView post, TradingShot predicted that Dogecoin could rally to as high as $1.25. He noted that the meme coin has been trading in a bullish Megaphone pattern within a channel up. The analyst added that the recent rebound on June 16 on the weekly MA200 is a higher low at the bottom of both patterns. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price To Jump Double-Digits To $0.2 With the 1-week Relative Strength Index (RSI) also rebounding on its long-term support zone, TradingShot declared that Dogecoin is most likely at the start of a new bullish leg. He noted that this could be the final rally that will shape this cycle’s top. Meanwhile, the analyst claimed that DOGE is targeting $1.25 because the previous two bullish legs peaked on the 3.618 Fibonacci extension of the last decline. He told market participants that they can settle for $0.8 if they wish to pursue a target within the Channel up. A rally to both $0.8 and $1.25 would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for Dogecoin, whose current ATH is at $0.73. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach these targets in the first half of next year. Dogecoin is expected to maintain a steady climb from now till then as it reaches those targets. The meme coin has already begun another uptrend following Bitcoin’s rally to a new ATH. DOGE has again reclaimed the $ 0.20 psychological price level and could potentially reach its last local high at around $0.26. DOGE Against Its Bitcoin Pair In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the DOGE/BTC chart is sitting in a historical zone of support with the monthly time frame indicators fully reset. The analyst indicated that this was possibly the best setup for Dogecoin, one that could spark a massive run for the meme coin. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Major Dogecoin Price Rally After Breaking 50-Day Trendline Meanwhile, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that the Dogecoin-to-Bitcoin chart might show a God candle this month.

2025-07-12T13:28:56,"What Happens When Bitcoin Solaris Hits LBank? Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Experts Project Immediate 150% Surge","The crypto market has always loved a plot twist. Just when investors were tracking Ethereum’s slow and steady rise to a projected $3,296 by 2030, another player has stepped onto the stage with a bolder promise and a tighter timeline. Bitcoin Solaris, a coin that once hovered quietly beneath the surface, is now commanding attention with a powerful presale, explosive demand, and a confirmed LBank listing that could change the game overnight. The question is no longer whether BTC-S can make noise. It’s how loud that noise will be when the listing bell rings. Ethereum Holds Its Ground, But BTC-S Is Racing Ahead Ethereum has proven itself as a cornerstone of the Web3 world. With thousands of DApps, smart contracts, and Layer 2 integrations, it’s not going anywhere. Predictions showing a price near $2,712 in 2026 and $5,370 by 2040 give it long-term credibility. But that kind of climb requires patience. Bitcoin Solaris, on the other hand, is offering a different timeline altogether. It’s not built to follow the market’s rhythm. It’s built to skip ahead of it. With the LBank listing on the horizon, users are treating BTC-S not just as an investment, but as a chance to relive the early Bitcoin days, only faster. Introducing Bitcoin Solaris: Built to Go Beyond Bitcoin Solaris is not just another altcoin. It’s a dual-layer blockchain ecosystem engineered for scale, speed, and user empowerment. At the heart of BTC-S is a two-tiered structure that separates base-level consensus from high-speed application execution. The Base Layer operates on Proof-of-Work, securing the network with real computational effort. The Solaris Layer runs on Delegated Proof-of-Stake, offering blazing-fast transactions with 2-second finality. Combined, they deliver over 10,000 transactions per second and 99.95% less energy usage than traditional PoW chains. Smart contracts are built for DeFi, gaming, and cross-chain interoperability using Rust for added security. And through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app, users will mine BTC-S directly from their mobile devices, making the coin accessible and inclusive. The mining calculator shows just how much passive power lies in your pocket. Presale Momentum and the Unexpected Price Rollback The Bitcoin Solaris presale is in its 11th and final phase. Currently priced at $11, it’s scheduled to launch at $20 on July 31, making the potential return a clean 150 percent. Over 14,150 unique users have already joined, with more than $6.6 million raised. Not Just Scalable Designed to Be Unstoppable That’s BTC-S But here’s the twist: for a very limited time, Bitcoin Solaris has announced a Price rollback, temporarily reducing the entry price to $5. Not a bonus. Not a discount. A rollback. A strategic move that turns heads and rewards fast movers. Given the tech and momentum, it’s rare to see a project this strong offer one last low-price window. And to ensure seamless delivery on launch day, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended, not for buying, but for receiving your tokens after July 31. LBank Listing: A Catalyst Waiting to Detonate When a coin with this much hype hits a major exchange, movement happens. LBank brings BTC-S to a global audience, with high liquidity and massive visibility. Combined with the speed and energy efficiency BTC-S offers, this listing is set to serve as a rocket booster. That’s why many are calling it the “Bitcoin of 2025”, a rare second chance for those who missed the early BTC days. The infrastructure is ready. The roadmap is bold. And the price point is still within reach. Verified and Reviewed: What Experts Are Saying Crypto analysts aren’t the only ones buzzing. Influencers are lighting up YouTube with detailed breakdowns of BTC-S. A Crypto Show video calls Bitcoin Solaris “the most complete presale project of 2025,” highlighting its dual-consensus architecture. Token Galaxy breaks down the technical innovations that make BTC-S stand out even in a crowded launch year. On top of that, investors are reassured by two major smart contract audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins , both confirming the project’s security and robustness. Bitcoin Solaris Roadmap: From Launch to Global Impact BTC-S is not a one-hit wonder. The project roadmap reveals a long-term vision that includes: Testnet launch, wallet development, and exchange integration in early 2026 A full mainnet with governance features and partnerships by mid-2026 Hardware wallet integration, Layer 2 scaling, and enterprise adoption by 2027 Education, innovation labs, and global collaborations from 2028 onward This isn’t just a coin. It’s an evolving financial ecosystem with a clear execution plan. Final Verdict: Get In Before the Window Closes While Ethereum inches forward on its long-term curve, Bitcoin Solaris is racing to break the charts before the year ends. With a confirmed LBank listing, a powerful presale structure, and game-changing technology, BTC-S is delivering on every front. And with the Price rollback live for a short time, this may be the last moment BTC-S is available under $10 ever again.

2025-07-12T13:20:42,"Bitwise CIO Says Bitcoin Sellers Are Almost Exhausted, Doubles Down on $200,000 Bitcoin Price Target – Here’s His Timeline","Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer (CIO) of the digital asset management firm Bitwise, is predicting that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will go up by more than 70% from the current level. In a new interview on the White Crypto YouTube channel, Hougan says Bitcoin could reach a price “north of $200,000” by the end of this year. According to the Bitwise CIO, demand for the crypto king is currently outstripping supply. “If you look at the amount of Bitcoin on exchange, it’s at record multi-year lows. We think those sellers are almost exhausted. At the same time, we think the institutional demand from companies, governments, and [exchange-traded funds] ETFs is increasing. So you have available supply decreasing and institutional demand increasing and rising concerns about the fiat system. We think that is a recipe for a significant end-of-the-year rally. So, our prediction is above $200,000.” By 2030, Hougan says the total market cap of Bitcoin could reach parity with that of gold. “Gold keeps going up. So that number keeps going up. I think it was like $800,000 when we made that prediction and maybe it’s $1.2 million by now. But we think parity with gold is about where we should end this cycle, which we think stretches for the rest of the decade. There are things that could increase that, and there are things that could decrease that. But we think that’s a reasonable pattern matching from historical cyclical growth. And I know that’s a long way, but I think Bitcoin could do it.” Bitcoin is trading at $117,110 at time of writing.

2025-07-12T13:20:13,"U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Ignite Market with Over $1 Billion Inflow Surge","BitcoinWorld U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Ignite Market with Over $1 Billion Inflow Surge The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement! On July 11, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed an extraordinary milestone, raking in over $1.02 billion in total net inflows. This remarkable surge marks the seventh consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling a powerful wave of institutional interest and confidence in the leading digital asset. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market, this development is not just a number; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and appeal to mainstream investors. Understanding the Phenomenon of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs For years, direct investment in Bitcoin for traditional financial institutions and retail investors was often complex, involving navigating crypto exchanges, managing private keys, and dealing with regulatory uncertainties. The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs changed the game entirely. These exchange-traded funds allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Here’s why they are so pivotal: Accessibility: They make Bitcoin investment as simple as buying a stock through a traditional brokerage account. Regulatory Clarity: Operating under the purview of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), they offer a regulated and secure investment vehicle. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, providing high liquidity for buying and selling. Institutional Gateway: They serve as a crucial bridge, allowing large institutional investors, pension funds, and wealth managers to allocate capital to Bitcoin within their existing compliance frameworks. The consistent positive inflows are a clear indicator that this gateway is being utilized heavily, reflecting a broader shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows : Who’s Leading the Charge? The $1.02 billion net inflow on July 11 was not just a collective effort; it was dominated by a few key players, showcasing significant conviction from major asset managers. This day alone surpassed many previous daily records, highlighting an accelerating pace of adoption. Let’s break down the contributions from the top performers: ETF Ticker Asset Manager Net Inflow (July 11) IBIT BlackRock $951.54 million ARKB ARK Invest $23.51 million Mini BTC Grayscale $20.93 million HODL VanEck $20.01 million BITB Bitwise $6.41 million BTCO Invesco $5.30 million BlackRock’s IBIT, once again, demonstrated its formidable market presence, accounting for the vast majority of the day’s inflows. This consistent dominance by BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, sends a powerful message about the long-term viability and attractiveness of Bitcoin as an investment asset. The fact that this marks the seventh consecutive day of positive Bitcoin ETF Inflows underscores a sustained, rather than sporadic, interest from investors. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption on Market Dynamics The steady stream of capital flowing into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has profound implications for the entire crypto ecosystem. It’s not just about the price of Bitcoin; it’s about its fundamental position in the global financial landscape. Key impacts include: Price Stability and Growth: Increased demand from large, long-term institutional investors can contribute to greater price stability and upward pressure on Bitcoin’s value, potentially reducing its historical volatility. Legitimacy and Mainstream Acceptance: The embrace by major financial institutions lends significant credibility to Bitcoin, paving the way for broader public and corporate acceptance. Market Maturation: As more regulated products emerge, the crypto market begins to resemble traditional financial markets, attracting a wider range of participants and capital. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: As ETFs accumulate Bitcoin, they effectively remove supply from the open market, which can create scarcity and further upward price pressure if demand continues to rise. This Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is a critical step in Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital asset to a recognized store of value and a legitimate asset class alongside gold, real estate, and equities. Navigating Future Crypto Market Trends : What’s Next? The consistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are setting a precedent for future Crypto Market Trends . This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it represents a significant shift in investor sentiment and capital allocation. What should investors and enthusiasts watch for next? Continued ETF Performance: Monitor daily and weekly inflow data. Sustained positive flows will reinforce the bullish narrative. Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on global regulatory stances on cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Favorable regulations could unlock even more institutional capital. Broader Digital Asset ETFs: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for similar products for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, further broadening the market. Corporate Treasury Adoption: As institutional comfort grows, more corporations might consider holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, following in the footsteps of early adopters. Retail Investor Sentiment: While institutional flows are dominant, a sustained bullish trend could reignite retail interest, creating a powerful synergy of demand. The current momentum suggests a strong foundational shift, but market watchers should remain vigilant for any shifts in global economic conditions or regulatory headwinds that could impact these trends. Strategies for Digital Asset Investment in a Maturing Landscape For individual investors looking to participate in this evolving landscape, understanding the dynamics of Digital Asset Investment is crucial. The advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs offers a new avenue, but it’s important to consider your personal investment goals and risk tolerance. Consider these strategies: Diversification: While Bitcoin is leading the charge, a diversified portfolio across various digital assets and traditional investments can mitigate risk. Long-Term Horizon: Institutional adoption often implies a long-term investment horizon. Volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market, so patience is key. Research and Due Diligence: Understand the underlying technology, market dynamics, and regulatory environment of any digital asset or ETF you consider investing in. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For those investing directly in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, regular, smaller investments can help average out the purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term price swings. Leverage ETFs Wisely: If choosing Bitcoin ETFs, understand their fee structures, liquidity, and how they track Bitcoin’s price. They offer convenience but also come with their own set of considerations compared to direct ownership. The market is maturing, but it’s still a relatively new asset class. Informed decisions, based on thorough research, are paramount. In conclusion, the astounding $1.02 billion in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 11, marking seven consecutive days of positive movement, is a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency market. Led overwhelmingly by BlackRock’s IBIT, these figures underscore a powerful and accelerating trend of institutional adoption. This influx of traditional capital is not merely boosting Bitcoin’s price; it is fundamentally reshaping its perception, solidifying its role as a legitimate and increasingly indispensable asset in global finance. As these trends continue, we can expect a more stable, mature, and widely accepted digital asset ecosystem, truly ushering in a new era for Bitcoin and beyond.

2025-07-12T13:08:05,"Exchange Inflows at Lowest Level in a Decade as BTC Hits New Highs: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a roll over the last few days, recording all-time highs (ATHs) again and again. Despite this significant surge, the market has witnessed no pressure from investors looking to lock in profits. The low pressure is evident in exchange inflows for both BTC and altcoins. Analysts at the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant said BTC, XRP, and ether (ETH) investors have been on the sidelines this week, despite their holdings seeing substantial profits. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Plummet According to CryptoQuant, total daily Bitcoin exchange inflows have fallen to 18,000 BTC, the lowest level since April 2015. This metric rose to 81,000 BTC in November 2024, when BTC first neared the $100,000 level. Large BTC holders are also sending fewer assets to crypto exchanges. The daily amount coming from this cohort of investors has plummeted from 62,000 BTC in November to 7,000 BTC currently. Less BTC flows from both large and small investors to exchanges, signaling less selling pressure, further implying that the market is not in overheating mode yet. Ether is witnessing similar exchange flows as BTC. The daily inflows for this asset have plunged to their lowest since October 2024. Investors are sending 584,000 ETH to exchanges today, compared to 1.57 million in February 2025. These low inflows coincide with ether’s 87% surge since early April. Low Pressure on Altcoins Additionally, XRP inflows to Binance have declined from the November spike of 10 billion XRP to 4 million XRP currently. At the time of the spike, there were several positive developments around the coin’s issuer, Ripple. Among them are the possible approval of the company’s stablecoin, RLUSD, and optimism surrounding an XRP-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). XRP had rallied at least 400% from $0.50 to $2.60 at the time, triggering a profit-taking frenzy among market participants. Currently, the opposite is the case. Even whales are on the sidelines following the coin’s rally above $2.90. Notably, XRP whale inflows have fallen 85% from 1.1 billion in February to 169 million today. CryptoQuant further revealed that the lack of selling pressure can be seen in the broader altcoin market as their exchange inflows have been muted. Daily inflows to exchanges usually spike following strong rallies as traders take profits. However, the figure has fallen to 21,000 from roughly 120,000 in March and December 2024.

2025-07-12T13:07:36,"Trump Slaps 30% Tariffs on EU and Mexico: Will Bitcoin’s Price React?","Following a few quiet months of tariff deadline extension, US President Donald Trump has hit several countries in the past week or so, with the latest being Mexico and all nations within the European Union. Given BTC’s response to the initial such threats in April, the question now arises whether the asset’s recent resurgence and jump to uncharted territory will come to an end. BREAKING: President Trump announces 30% tariff on the European Union and Mexico. Trump says if they retaliate, these tariffs will be raised by the same amount as the retaliation. pic.twitter.com/JQ1HsLeseO — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 12, 2025 The letter sent to “Her Excellency” – EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, reads that it’s Trump’s “great honor” to demonstrate the strength and commitment of the two parties’ trading relationship, even though the US has “one of the largest trade deficits” with the Union. Consequently, the POTUS has described the 30% tariffs, which will go into effect on August 1, as a “more balanced and fair trade” that will allow the US to continue its relationship with the EU. At the same time, Trump’s letter reads that the EU will “allow complete, open market access to the United States, with no tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large trade deficit” and issue the following warning: “If for any reason you decide to raise your tarrifs and retaliate, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 30% that we charge.” The letter to the Mexican President, Dr. Claudia Pardo, carried a similar message and the same threat. Recent history from earlier this year shows that bitcoin’s price tends to be highly affected by tariffs imposed or even threatened by the US President against other countries. Back in April, as Trump was slapping tariffs against essentially every country, BTC tumbled from over $100,000 to under $75,000 to mark a five-month low . It has recovered a lot of ground since then, and it skyrocketed to a new all-time high earlier this week at over $119,000. It would be interesting to follow whether the latest set of tariffs will hinder its progress or will BTC rise above them. BTCUSD.

2025-07-12T13:05:54,"‘We Expect Bitcoin to Top $200K by the End of Year’, Says Bitwise CIO","At the time of writing bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around the $118,000 level, flirting with the idea of setting a new all-time high this weekend. On Friday, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X that BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) had reached an important milestone at the close of trading on the previous day, becoming the fastest ETF to get to $80 billion in assets under management (AUM). The second fastest ETF to get to this level was Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which got there in 1,814 days. On Friday, bitcoin set a new all-time high of $118,667. During interviews with CNBC and Yahoo Financ e, Bitwise Asset Management CIO said his firm expects the BTC price to reach over $200,000 by the end of this year. As for how high bitcoin could go, hedge fund manager James Lavish says that the bitcoin price is similar to the U.S. debt ceiling in that ultimately there is no limit. Technical Analysis Bitcoin displayed a consolidation pattern throughout the 23-hour timeframe from 11 July 11:00 to 12 July 10:00, operating within a comprehensive range of $1,633.46 representing 1% from the peak of $118,226.29 to the trough of $116,592.83, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The most significant price movements occurred during the initial hours, particularly around 13:00 and 15:00 on 11 July, when elevated volume above the 24-hour average of 7,291 accompanied pronounced intraday swings, forming key support near $116,726.00 and resistance around $118,226.00. Following this early turbulence, BTC demonstrated exceptional stability with decreasing volume, consolidating mainly between $117,400.00-$117,900.00, before exhibiting renewed strength in the final hours with a recovery toward $118,025.00, suggesting potential bullish momentum developing for the subsequent trading session. Throughout the final 60 minutes from 12 July 09:57 to 10:56, Bitcoin encountered heightened volatility with a notable downward movement from $118,121.16 to a low of $117,835.74 at 10:14, followed by a strong rebound that established the $118,000.00-$118,070.00 range as a new consolidation zone. The period displayed classic support and resistance dynamics, with volume spikes of 392.48 and 382.49 during the 10:12-10:14 selloff confirming institutional participation, while the subsequent recovery above $118,035.00 on diminishing volume suggests underlying strength and potential for continued upward momentum.

2025-07-12T13:00:58,"OpenAI’s Crucial AI Model Release Faces Unexpected Delay","BitcoinWorld OpenAI’s Crucial AI Model Release Faces Unexpected Delay In the rapidly evolving world where artificial intelligence increasingly intersects with blockchain and digital assets, news from tech giants like OpenAI sends ripples across the entire innovation landscape. For those tracking the pulse of technological advancements, the latest announcement from OpenAI regarding its highly anticipated AI model release is a significant development, raising questions about the balance between innovation speed and responsible deployment. Understanding OpenAI’s Latest Delay: Sam Altman’s Commitment to Safety For the second time this summer, OpenAI has announced a delay in the release of its groundbreaking open AI model . Originally slated for next week, the launch has been pushed back indefinitely. Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , confirmed the decision, citing the critical need for additional safety testing and thorough review of high-risk areas. In a post on X, Altman emphasized, “We need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. We are not yet sure how long it will take us.” This cautious approach highlights the company’s commitment to ensuring the model’s integrity before it becomes widely accessible. Altman added, “While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back. This is new for us and we want to get it right.” Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Capability wise, we think the model is phenomenal — but our bar for an open source model is high and we think we need some more time to make sure we’re releasing a model we’re proud of along every axis.” What Makes This OpenAI AI Model So Anticipated? The delayed open AI model from OpenAI is one of the most keenly awaited events in the AI community this summer, alongside the expected release of GPT-5 . This new open model is anticipated to possess reasoning capabilities similar to OpenAI ‘s ‘o-series’ of models, promising a significant leap forward in accessible AI technology. Bitcoin World previously reported that OpenAI leaders have even discussed enabling this open AI model to connect to the company’s cloud-hosted AI models for complex queries, though it remains uncertain if these advanced features will be included in the final release. The expectation is that this model will set a new benchmark, becoming best-in-class compared to other open models currently available. Its release could empower developers with unprecedented tools, fostering innovation across countless applications. Navigating the Intense AI Competition Landscape The decision to delay comes at a time of escalating AI competition within Silicon Valley. OpenAI is striving to maintain its leadership position against formidable contenders like xAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, all of whom are investing billions into their own AI initiatives. The competitive landscape became even more dynamic recently with the launch of Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2, a one trillion parameter open AI model that has demonstrated superior performance over OpenAI ’s GPT-4.1 AI model on several agentic-coding benchmarks. This intensified rivalry underscores the pressure on OpenAI to not only innovate but also to ensure the robustness and safety of its products before public release. The delay, while frustrating for developers, might be a strategic move to ensure the model is truly groundbreaking and secure, safeguarding OpenAI ‘s reputation and competitive edge. The Broader Implications for the AI Ecosystem The indefinite postponement of OpenAI ‘s open AI model has broader implications for the entire AI ecosystem . Developers eager to integrate OpenAI ‘s latest capabilities into their projects will have to wait, potentially slowing down certain innovation cycles. However, this delay also highlights a growing industry trend: prioritizing safety and ethical considerations over rapid deployment. In a world where AI’s power is rapidly expanding, the responsible development of these technologies is paramount. The challenges of ensuring an AI model’s safety, especially one whose weights cannot be recalled once released, are immense. This cautious approach by OpenAI could set a precedent for the industry, encouraging other developers to adopt similar rigorous testing protocols. While the wait is extended, the commitment to a safer, more reliable AI model could ultimately benefit the community in the long run. What’s Next for OpenAI and the AI World? The delay of OpenAI ‘s open AI model is a stark reminder of the complexities and responsibilities inherent in developing advanced artificial intelligence. While the anticipation for this model, and for GPT-5 , remains high, Sam Altman ‘s emphasis on safety underscores a mature approach to innovation. The coming months will be crucial for OpenAI as it navigates the final stages of development, aiming to deliver a model that is not only powerful but also impeccably safe and reliable. The broader AI ecosystem will undoubtedly watch closely, as OpenAI ‘s decisions continue to shape the future trajectory of AI development and its impact on technology and society.

Bullish Bets Rise as HYPE Enters Price Discovery Phase","HYPE price surged to a new all-time high, thus potentially entering its parabolic phase of the 2025 bull rally. The Hyperliquid platform has grown to a vital DEX focused on perpetual futures trading with over $10 billion in Open Interest. The majority of Polymarket traders doubt whether HYPE could reach $100 by the end of 2025.

2025-07-12T12:57:21,"Investors have committed $16 million to Bitcoin futures, Bank of Russia report","Russian investors have bought Bitcoin futures worth more than $16 million in less than a month of trading, according to stats released by the Central Bank of Russia. Private individuals account for the majority of purchases, the monetary authority noted, reminding Russian citizens that crypto derivatives carry similar risks to their underlying assets. CBR gauges Russia’s new Bitcoin futures market The Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) has published statistical data revealing the size of the country’s young market for futures based on cryptocurrency prices. It added those numbers to the latest edition of its “Overview of Financial Market Risks.” As of June 27, the total volume of open net positions of retail investors was approximately 1.25 billion rubles (over $16 million), the document unveiled. “The share of individuals in the total volume of long positions is 97%,” the regulator highlighted. The trading of futures linked to the value of the leading cryptocurrency started on June 4 in Russia, when the Moscow Exchange launched contracts on the shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) expiring in September. That became possible in late May when the CBR allowed financial institutions to offer crypto derivatives to qualified investors while warning both financial firms and their clients in Russia against direct investments in digital assets. This week, it took the opportunity to reiterate its concerns. “It’s worth noting that these instruments carry increased risks for investors,” the monetary authority stated, emphasizing: “Cryptocurrencies are volatile and risky, therefore, investments in instruments whose pricing depends on them will also have such characteristics.” The most common positions, open by the majority of investors (2,800), are under 500,000 rubles (below $6,500), the report detailed. At the same time, private investors controlling larger capital, with portfolios exceeding 100 million rubles, account for a significant portion of the invested funds, the central bank noticed. These are followed by other big players with capital ranging between 10 million to 50 million rubles. “However, it is worth noting that the number of investors in these cohorts is relatively small, the Bank of Russia commented. It also remarked: “The opposite short position is mainly occupied by non-resident legal entities.” Crypto derivatives still out of reach for ordinary Russians While recent reports have revealed that Russians hold over $25 billion worth of crypto assets, financial regulators in the country, including the central bank and the finance ministry, remain opposed to giving ordinary citizens access to cryptocurrencies or crypto derivatives. In March this year, the CBR suggested to allow a limited number of investors to acquire and trade digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) within the framework of an “experimental legal regime” (ELR). The bank said these should be “highly qualified investors” only. To fall in that category, which is yet to be legally defined, private individuals would need to prove annual income of 50 million rubles (over $600,000) or more and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles ($1.2 million), the authority proposed. Meanwhile, a new study, the results of which were published by the business daily Vedomosti this week, showed that 52% of Russia’s qualified investors already have crypto in their wallets. And another 38%, who haven’t bought yet, intend to do so in the future, bringing the total of those interested in crypto investments to 90% of the respondents. The Central Bank of Russia, however, remains stubborn in its stance against Bitcoin. Its governor, Elvira Nabiullina, recently insisted the monetary policy regulator has no current plans to add cryptocurrencies to its reserves. The CBR also rejects any possibility of permitting the use of digital coins such as BTC for payments within its territory, outside the ELR. The special regime allows Russian companies to employ BTC and other coins in international settlements with trading partners amid financial restrictions imposed with war-related sanctions on Moscow.

2025-07-12T12:52:57,"AltSeason Incoming? Open Interest in These Altcoins Nears $1B Milestone—What’s Next?","The post AltSeason Incoming? Open Interest in These Altcoins Nears $1B Milestone—What’s Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is showing strong signs of life beyond Bitcoin. Futures Open Interest (OI)—a key metric reflecting the number of outstanding derivative contracts—has surged for several top altcoins. XRP, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) are seeing a sharp rise in leveraged positions, with OI across these tokens nearing or surpassing the $1 billion mark. Historically, a rise in both price and OI signals not just trader enthusiasm but an influx of new capital, often a precursor to broader altcoin rallies. As market sentiment shifts from Bitcoin to other large-cap cryptos, investors are now questioning: Is AltSeason finally around the corner? What Is Open Interest and Why It Matters? Open Interest (OI) refers to the total number of active futures or options contracts that haven’t been settled. It serves as a key indicator of market participation and sentiment. When OI rises alongside price, it often signals that new money is entering the market, supporting a stronger trend. In the altcoin space, increasing OI can indicate heightened investor confidence and potential for price expansion. Conversely, if OI rises while prices fall, it could hint at bearish leverage or a setup for liquidation events. Monitoring OI helps traders gauge momentum and anticipate potential breakout or breakdown scenarios. Top Altcoins With OI Above $1B Ripple (XRP ) XRP’s OI has exploded past $3.4 billion, rising by nearly $1 billion in just a few days. This surge has come alongside a notable price rally of over 20%, suggesting that whales and institutions may be positioning early for a large move. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s OI on CME and Binance has risen to about $3.2 billion, the highest since February. The momentum is backed by strong ETF inflows and renewed interest from institutional investors, especially as ETH trades comfortably above $2,650. Solana (SOL) Solana continues to attract speculative interest, with OI rapidly climbing as traders anticipate explosive gains during any altcoin rotation. With DeFi and NFT activity heating up on the network, SOL could be a top beneficiary if market momentum sustains. Top Altcoins Approaching $1B OI BinanceCoin (BNB) BNB’s open interest (OI) currently ranges between $567M and $781M, reflecting a significant rise following its recent $1B token burn. The increase in OI suggests growing trader interest and capital inflow into BNB futures, pointing to heightened speculative momentum. If this trend continues alongside price gains, it may support a bullish breakout. However, elevated OI can also increase the risk of volatility if leverage becomes overheated. Traders should monitor OI shifts closely for signs of strength or exhaustion. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Fartcoin’s current futures open interest (OI) stands at approximately $754 million, showing an 8%+ rise in the past 24 hours—reflecting strong speculation and bullish positioning. This puts Fartcoin near the top of meme-coin derivatives activity by open interest. The rising OI, especially alongside positive funding rates and price momentum, suggests traders are targeting further upside (possibly toward ~$1.50–2.00 or more). However, elevated leverage also increases the risk of sharp corrections if sentiment shifts. Aave (AAVE) Aave’s aggregate futures open interest is currently around $438.7 million, reflecting positions in both coin-margined and stablecoin-denominated contracts. Over the past 24 hours, OI has slightly declined by approximately 1.2%. According to Messari, AAVE’s total open interest stands near $339.9 million, up about 3.3% over the past week. This level suggests moderate trader involvement, signaling steady interest without extreme leverage risk. Does This Signal an AltSeason? A rise in OI across altcoins, paired with consistent upward price movement, is often a precursor to AltSeason. This is when money flows out of Bitcoin and into altcoins, causing explosive rallies across the board. Here’s why the current setup is bullish: BTC dominance is stabilizing or weakening. Altcoins are seeing increasing OI without large liquidation events. Retail sentiment is reviving as news of large gains (especially XRP) spreads. Despite the bullish setups, factors like Bitcoin volatility and overleveraged markets & macroeconomic pressure may negatively impact, delaying the Altseason. However, the Open Interest (OI) of the top tokens has surged significantly, which suggests the market momentum is clearly heating up. If Bitcoin remains stable or consolidates around key levels, the setup for a July-to-August is stronger than it’s been in months.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/altseason-incoming-open-interest-in-these-altcoins-nears-1b-milestone-whats-next/,"ALTCOIN|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ETH","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T12:30:49,"Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Is Your Crypto Portfolio Ready for Bitcoin’s Reign?","BitcoinWorld Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Is Your Crypto Portfolio Ready for Bitcoin’s Reign? The crypto world is a dynamic place, constantly shifting between periods of explosive growth for alternative cryptocurrencies and times when Bitcoin firmly holds the reins. Currently, the spotlight is on the latter, with the Altcoin Season Index, a crucial metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registering a modest 28 at 0:35 UTC on July 12. This figure, down two points from the previous day, clearly signals that the market is deep into a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your digital asset portfolio, and how can you navigate these shifting tides? What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index and How Does It Work? For many in the crypto space, understanding the broader market cycle is key to making informed decisions. The Altcoin Season Index is designed precisely for this purpose. It serves as a compass, guiding investors through the often-turbulent waters of cryptocurrency market cycles. Here’s a breakdown of how this fascinating index operates: The Core Comparison: The index rigorously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This long-term window helps smooth out daily volatility and provides a clearer picture of sustained trends. Exclusions for Clarity: To ensure the index accurately reflects genuine altcoin growth, it specifically excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC). These tokens are pegged to other assets or represent wrapped versions of other cryptocurrencies and do not typically exhibit independent price action driven by market sentiment in the same way as native altcoins. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially declared in an Altcoin Season, a significant majority—at least 75%—of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. This indicates broad-based strength across the altcoin market. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, a Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day timeframe. The current reading of 28 clearly falls within this range, underscoring Bitcoin’s present dominance. The Scoring System: The index scores range from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger leaning towards Altcoin Season, while a lower score, like our current 28, points to Bitcoin’s command. Understanding this metric is fundamental for anyone serious about cryptocurrency investing . It provides a macro-level view that can inform your strategic asset allocation. Why Are We In a Bitcoin Season Right Now? The current low reading on the Altcoin Season Index isn’t just a random number; it reflects underlying dynamics in the crypto market trends . Several factors often contribute to Bitcoin’s periods of dominance: Flight to Safety: In times of economic uncertainty or broader market instability, investors often flock to Bitcoin, viewing it as a relatively safer and more established asset compared to the more volatile altcoins. Bitcoin’s larger market capitalization and longer track record contribute to this perception. Institutional Adoption: Major institutional interest, particularly with the advent of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, has funneled significant capital directly into Bitcoin. This influx of large-scale investment can disproportionately boost Bitcoin’s price and dominance compared to the broader altcoin market. Halving Cycle Anticipation: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically precede significant bull runs. In the lead-up to a halving, Bitcoin often sees increased accumulation as investors anticipate future price appreciation, pulling focus and capital away from altcoins. Dominance Metric: The Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) often mirrors the Altcoin Season Index. When BTC.D rises, it means Bitcoin is capturing a larger share of the total crypto market capitalization, which is characteristic of a Bitcoin Season. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions can lead to a risk-off sentiment in traditional markets, which often spills over into the crypto space. During such periods, Bitcoin is often seen as the primary hedge or store of value within the digital asset ecosystem. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends: What Does This Mean for Investors? Understanding that we are in a Bitcoin Season is crucial for adapting your investment approach. It suggests that while Bitcoin might be experiencing steady growth or consolidation, many altcoins could be lagging or even seeing declines against Bitcoin. Here’s what this period of crypto market trends often entails: Reduced Altcoin Volatility (Relative to Bitcoin): While altcoins are inherently volatile, during Bitcoin Season, their movements often become more subdued or directly correlated with Bitcoin’s price action. They might not see independent breakouts. Focus on Large Caps: Capital tends to flow into larger, more established altcoins first when sentiment eventually shifts, before trickling down to smaller, more speculative assets. The Importance of Bitcoin Price Action: Bitcoin’s performance becomes the primary driver for the entire market. A strong Bitcoin run can eventually pull altcoins up, but a Bitcoin correction can drag them down even more severely. Sector Rotation: Even within a Bitcoin Season, there can be brief periods where certain altcoin sectors (e.g., AI tokens, GameFi, DePIN) experience mini-runs due to specific news or developments. However, these are often short-lived and do not signify a broader Altcoin Season. For investors, this period can be a time for strategic accumulation of quality altcoins at potentially lower prices, or a focus on Bitcoin itself. Strategies for Optimal Altcoin Performance in a Bitcoin-Dominated Market Even when Bitcoin is leading the charge, there are still ways to optimize your altcoin performance . It’s not about abandoning altcoins entirely, but rather about being more selective and strategic. Consider these actionable insights: Accumulate Quality Projects: Use periods of altcoin underperformance to accumulate projects with strong fundamentals, clear utility, active development teams, and robust communities. Look beyond the hype and focus on long-term value. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the bottom, consistently invest a fixed amount into your chosen altcoins over time. This strategy mitigates risk and averages out your purchase price. Portfolio Rebalancing: If your portfolio has become heavily weighted towards Bitcoin during its run, consider rebalancing by taking some profits from Bitcoin and reallocating to undervalued altcoins you believe in. However, do this cautiously and in line with your risk tolerance. Research and Due Diligence (DYOR): This cannot be stressed enough. In a Bitcoin Season, many altcoins will bleed against Bitcoin. Identifying the ones with genuine potential requires deep research into their technology, tokenomics, use cases, and competitive landscape. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on the Bitcoin Dominance chart. A significant drop in BTC.D could be an early signal that altcoins are starting to gain strength, potentially foreshadowing the next Altcoin Season. Remember, patience is a virtue in crypto. Altcoin Season will eventually return, but positioning yourself wisely during Bitcoin’s reign is key to capitalizing on future opportunities. Smart Cryptocurrency Investing: Principles for Any Market Season Regardless of whether it’s an Altcoin Season or a Bitcoin Season , certain fundamental principles of cryptocurrency investing remain constant. Adhering to these can help protect your capital and foster long-term growth. Here are key principles for smart investing: Risk Management is Paramount: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Crypto markets are notoriously volatile. Diversify your portfolio across different assets and sectors to spread risk. Define Your Investment Goals: Are you a short-term trader or a long-term holder? Your goals will dictate your strategy. For long-term investors, market cycles like Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season are opportunities to accumulate. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Keep up with major news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements, but avoid getting caught up in daily FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Emotional Discipline: The crypto market tests emotional resilience. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on price swings. Stick to your pre-defined investment plan. Security First: Always prioritize the security of your assets. Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. These principles form the bedrock of successful participation in the digital asset space, helping you navigate both the exhilarating highs and challenging lows. Challenges and Opportunities in a Bitcoin Season While a Bitcoin Season might seem less exciting for altcoin enthusiasts, it presents its own set of challenges and unique opportunities. Challenges: Altcoin Underperformance: Many altcoins will struggle to gain ground against Bitcoin, leading to ‘altcoin bleed’. Patience Required: It can be frustrating to see your altcoin holdings stagnant or declining while Bitcoin rises. False Breakouts: Some altcoins might experience brief pumps, only to quickly retrace, trapping inexperienced traders. Opportunities: Accumulation: A chance to buy quality altcoins at potentially discounted prices. Research Time: More time to conduct thorough research on projects without the pressure of rapidly moving markets. Portfolio Restructuring: An ideal period to re-evaluate your portfolio and consolidate positions into stronger assets. Conclusion: Adapting to the Rhythm of the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index at 28 is a clear signal: we are currently in a Bitcoin Season . This isn’t a cause for panic, but rather an invitation to adjust your strategy. Understanding how the index works, why Bitcoin is currently dominant, and the broader crypto market trends allows you to make more informed decisions. While the allure of massive altcoin gains is powerful, recognizing Bitcoin’s current reign is paramount. Focus on solid cryptocurrency investing principles: research, risk management, and patience. Use this period to identify strong projects, accumulate strategically, and prepare for the eventual shift back towards broader altcoin performance . The crypto market moves in cycles, and being attuned to these rhythms is the key to long-term success.

2025-07-12T12:25:46,"Here’s Bitcoin’s path to $250,000 by Q4, according to expert","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ongoing bullish run shows no signs of slowing, with an analyst projecting that the asset could reach $200,000 by 2025. To this end, trading expert Michaël van de Poppe forecasts that Bitcoin will reach a record high of $250,000 by Q4 2025, according to his July 11 post on X. He expects the maiden digital asset to reach $125,000 in July, climb to $150,000 by the end of the quarter, and ultimately target $250,000 by year-end. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Poppe’s outlook is guided by Bitcoin’s ability to break decisively above the $110,000 and $112,000 resistance zone, which had capped previous rallies. He noted that late June saw liquidity sweep below $105,000, followed by accumulation around $100,400 and $105,000, paving the way for the breakout. The recent move above $110,000 was accompanied by rising volume, indicating strong buying momentum. While a short-term pullback is possible as liquidity above $112,000 is absorbed, Poppe sees $125,000 and $150,000 as near-term targets, with a potential parabolic run to $250,000 if these levels give way. Key Bitcoin price levels to watch Separately, pseudonymous analyst BitBull, in a July 12 X post , echoed similar targets. He noted that after breaking $117,000, Bitcoin could push toward $120,000 in the coming days, followed by a period of consolidation. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: BitBull This pattern, he said, resembles February 2024, when Bitcoin paused after a sharp rally, giving altcoins room to catch up before resuming its climb. BitBull projects Bitcoin could then advance to $135,000 and $140,000, marking a potential local top. Bitcoin price analysis At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $117,810, representing a gain of more than 8% over the past week. Bitcoin price chart.

2025-07-12T12:20:05,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Unlocking the Astonishing $500,000 BTC Bull Run Potential","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Unlocking the Astonishing $500,000 BTC Bull Run Potential Imagine Bitcoin soaring to a staggering $500,000 by year-end. While it might sound like a distant dream, recent Bitcoin price prediction analyses suggest this audacious target isn’t entirely out of reach. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a possibility rooted in deep technical patterns and evolving macroeconomic landscapes that could propel the world’s leading cryptocurrency into an unprecedented rally. Unpacking the Audacious Bitcoin Price Prediction: Is $500,000 Possible? The notion of Bitcoin hitting half a million dollars might seem extraordinary, yet it’s a figure gaining traction among seasoned analysts. A significant Bitcoin price prediction comes from anonymous crypto analyst apsk32, who points to BTC’s current position relative to its long-term power curve trendline. This mathematical model is crucial because it tracks Bitcoin’s inherent exponential growth, acting as a historical roadmap for its price trajectory. Currently, BTC finds itself two years ahead of this trendline, a position historically associated with what analysts term the ‘extreme greed’ zone. Historically, this ‘extreme greed’ phase has preceded euphoric market peaks, specifically observed in the bull runs of 2013, 2017, and 2021. If the established four-year market cycle continues to repeat its pattern, apsk32 anticipates a substantial surge, projecting BTC to reach between $200,000 and $300,000 by Christmas. This momentum is then expected to gradually recede in early 2026, marking the potential end of this particular cycle’s peak. Decoding the BTC Price Analysis: The Power Curve and Historical Cycles To truly grasp the potential outlined in this audacious BTC price analysis , it’s essential to understand the underlying principles driving these predictions. The ‘long-term power curve trendline’ isn’t just a fancy term; it’s a robust mathematical framework that has, with remarkable accuracy, mapped Bitcoin’s exponential ascent over its lifetime. This curve suggests that despite its volatility, Bitcoin adheres to a predictable growth trajectory over extended periods. The concept of a ‘four-year cycle’ is equally pivotal in this BTC price analysis . This cycle, often correlated with Bitcoin’s supply shock events, has historically dictated periods of accumulation, rapid price appreciation (the bull run), and subsequent consolidation. The ‘extreme greed’ zone, as identified by apsk32, represents the latter stages of this rapid appreciation phase. Past cycles have shown that when Bitcoin enters this zone, it signifies a period of intense speculative interest and widespread FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), driving prices to new all-time highs before a natural cooling-off period. Here’s a look at how Bitcoin has historically performed during these peak cycle years: Cycle Peak Year Approximate Price Peak Historical Context 2013 ~$1,100 Early adopter euphoria, first major parabolic surge. 2017 ~$20,000 Retail investor boom, widespread media attention. 2021 ~$69,000 Institutional adoption, corporate balance sheet inclusion. 2024/2025 (Projected) $200K – $500K Global macroeconomic shifts, continued institutional integration. Macroeconomic Tailwinds Fueling Bitcoin Growth: What to Watch? Beyond the technical charts, a powerful confluence of macroeconomic factors is also poised to ignite significant Bitcoin growth . Satraj Bambra, CEO of perpetual trading platform Rails, emphasizes that shifts in global monetary policy and economic indicators could serve as potent catalysts for further gains, particularly looking ahead to 2025. Bambra highlights three critical macroeconomic signals that historically favor risk assets like Bitcoin: An Expanding U.S. Federal Reserve Balance Sheet: When the Fed expands its balance sheet, it typically involves quantitative easing (QE), injecting more liquidity into the financial system. This increased money supply often seeks higher returns, flowing into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. A Pivot to Lower Interest Rates: Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing and make traditional savings less attractive, pushing investors towards assets with higher potential yields, including digital currencies. This encourages both institutional and retail investors to deploy capital into growth-oriented sectors. A Falling U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): A weaker U.S. dollar often correlates with stronger commodity prices and increased investment in alternative assets. As the dollar loses purchasing power, investors seek hedges, and Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ becomes an appealing option. These combined factors signal a renewed era of stimulus and a ‘risk-on’ sentiment across global markets. Such an environment is precisely what could propel Bitcoin to the upper echelons of predictions, potentially sending its value soaring to an astonishing $300,000 to $500,000. Navigating the Crypto Market Forecast: Opportunities and Challenges While the crypto market forecast paints an incredibly optimistic picture, it’s crucial to approach these predictions with a balanced perspective. The potential for substantial gains is undeniable, but so are the inherent challenges and risks that characterize the volatile world of digital assets. Key Opportunities Driving the Forecast: Growing Institutional Interest: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has opened doors for traditional finance, bringing in significant capital and legitimacy. This institutional embrace is expected to continue, providing a stable foundation for future price appreciation. Increasing Utility and Adoption: Beyond its role as a store of value, Bitcoin’s underlying technology continues to evolve, with developments in scalability solutions and broader integration into payment systems. Global Economic Rebalancing: As nations grapple with inflation and debt, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive hedge against traditional financial instability. Potential Challenges and Risks: Regulatory Headwinds: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable legislation could introduce significant market uncertainty and impact the positive crypto market forecast . Market Volatility: Bitcoin is renowned for its dramatic price swings. While these can lead to massive gains, they also carry the risk of substantial losses. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events, technological exploits, or major geopolitical shifts could trigger sudden and sharp market downturns, disrupting even the most optimistic forecasts. Profit-Taking and Correction: Even in a strong bull market, healthy corrections are inevitable. As prices surge, early investors may take profits, leading to temporary pullbacks that can test investor conviction. Preparing for the Next Bitcoin Bull Run: Actionable Insights With the potential for an unprecedented Bitcoin bull run on the horizon, many investors are wondering how best to position themselves. While financial advice should always come from a qualified professional, here are some general actionable insights based on historical market behavior and common investment principles: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, thoroughly research Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Understand the technology, the market dynamics, and the risks involved. Relying solely on a single Bitcoin price prediction can be risky. Consider a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s history shows that its most significant gains are realized over multi-year cycles. Short-term volatility can be jarring, but a long-term ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) strategy has often proven effective for patient investors during past bull runs. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This strategy averages out your purchase price over time, mitigating the risk of buying at a peak and smoothing out volatility. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and avoid putting all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising it appears. A diversified approach helps mitigate risks associated with any single asset’s performance. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analyses, and macroeconomic developments. The crypto space evolves rapidly, and staying informed is key to making timely and informed decisions throughout the potential Bitcoin bull run . The audacious predictions of Bitcoin reaching $200,000, $300,000, or even an incredible $500,000 by year-end are certainly captivating. Driven by both robust technical indicators like the long-term power curve and favorable macroeconomic shifts, the stage appears set for a potentially historic Bitcoin bull run . While no prediction is guaranteed, the confluence of historical patterns and external catalysts provides a compelling narrative for Bitcoin’s continued ascent. As the crypto market continues to evolve, understanding these driving forces becomes paramount for anyone looking to navigate its complexities. Whether Bitcoin hits these exact targets or not, the underlying trends suggest a vibrant and dynamic future for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.

2025-07-12T12:00:57,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling the Surge to Extreme Greed","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling the Surge to Extreme Greed Are you feeling the buzz in the crypto air? The digital asset market is once again capturing headlines, and a key indicator, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , has just sent a powerful signal. Surging to a striking 79, this crucial metric has officially entered the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone. What does this dramatic shift mean for your portfolio, and more importantly, for the future trajectory of the crypto landscape? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, serves as a fascinating barometer for the prevailing mood in the cryptocurrency market. It’s designed to give investors a quick snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly fearful or excessively greedy. Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 denotes ‘Extreme Greed’, this index provides invaluable insights into collective investor psychology. Think of it as a temperature gauge for the market. When the needle points towards ‘Fear’, it often suggests that prices are low and potentially represent buying opportunities for the brave. Conversely, a move into ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ can indicate that the market might be overheated, possibly signaling a time for caution or profit-taking. The recent jump to 79, up eight points from the previous day, is a significant shift that demands our attention. How is This Powerful Index Calculated? The accuracy and relevance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stem from its sophisticated methodology, which aggregates data from six distinct market factors. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the overall score, ensuring a holistic view of market sentiment. Let’s break down these components: Volatility (25%): This factor measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates a fearful market, but rapid upward swings can also contribute to greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volumes and strong positive momentum typically signal a greedy market. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for specific keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency. A high volume of positive sentiment and engagement often correlates with rising greed. Surveys (15%): Historically, Alternative conducted weekly polls to gauge investor sentiment. However, it’s important to note that this factor is currently paused. When active, it provided direct insights into what individual investors were thinking. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is a key indicator. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear, as investors might be flocking to the perceived safety of BTC during uncertain times. Conversely, a falling dominance, with altcoins gaining traction, might indicate a more speculative, greedy market. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” might indicate fear, while terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “best altcoins to buy” could signal growing greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index provides a nuanced perspective on the collective psyche of crypto investors, helping to explain the current shift towards Extreme Greed . The Surge to Extreme Greed: What Does 79 Mean? A score of 79 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market firmly in the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory. This is a significant psychological milestone. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections or significant price pullbacks. It suggests that investors are becoming overly optimistic, potentially leading to irrational exuberance and speculative buying. When the market is gripped by Extreme Greed , it’s common to see phenomena such as: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): New investors, or those who have been on the sidelines, jump into the market, fearing they will miss out on further gains. High Leverage Trading: Traders take on increased risk, using borrowed funds to amplify their positions, betting on continued upward momentum. Ignoring Fundamentals: Less attention is paid to the underlying technology, adoption, or economic realities, with focus solely on price action. Rapid Price Increases: Assets, especially altcoins, can experience parabolic price movements, driven by speculative fervor rather than intrinsic value. While the immediate feeling might be euphoric, seasoned investors often view ‘Extreme Greed’ as a cautionary signal. It’s a time to review portfolios, consider taking profits, and prepare for potential shifts in the market dynamic. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: Why It’s Crucial for Your Strategy Understanding crypto market sentiment is paramount for any investor navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrencies are heavily influenced by psychological factors due to their relatively nascent stage and decentralized nature. The collective mood of participants can dictate short-term price movements more than fundamental analysis alone. When sentiment shifts from fear to greed, it typically fuels upward price momentum. Positive news, regulatory clarity, or even influential tweets can quickly turn the tide. Conversely, negative news, security breaches, or major sell-offs can plunge the market into fear. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a quantitative measure of this often-qualitative aspect, allowing investors to objectively assess the prevailing mood. Key aspects of market sentiment: Contrarian Indicator: Many use the index as a contrarian indicator: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” A high ‘Extreme Greed’ reading might suggest it’s time to be cautious. Market Cycles: Sentiment often moves in cycles, from despair to hope, then optimism, and finally euphoria (greed), followed by complacency, anxiety, denial, and panic (fear). Recognizing where the market is in this cycle can inform investment decisions. Impact on Adoption: Positive sentiment can attract new users and institutional investors, driving further adoption and potentially long-term growth. By closely monitoring crypto market sentiment , investors can avoid making emotional decisions and instead align their strategies with a more informed understanding of market psychology. The Impact on Bitcoin Price and Beyond: What’s Next? The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 79 has direct implications for the Bitcoin price and the broader altcoin market. As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin often sets the tone for the entire ecosystem. When the market enters ‘Extreme Greed’, Bitcoin typically experiences significant price pumps, attracting new capital and reinforcing the bullish narrative. For Bitcoin: Potential for Continued Upside: The immediate effect might be continued price appreciation as FOMO kicks in. Increased Volatility: While prices rise, volatility can also increase, leading to sharp corrections as traders take profits. Liquidation Risks: High leverage in a greedy market can lead to cascading liquidations if a sudden downturn occurs, amplifying price drops. For Altcoins: “Altcoin Season” Potential: When Bitcoin performs well, capital often flows into altcoins, leading to even more explosive gains for smaller cap assets. This is often a characteristic of an ‘Extreme Greed’ phase. Higher Risk/Reward: While altcoins offer higher potential returns during such periods, they also carry significantly higher risks due to their lower liquidity and greater sensitivity to market sentiment shifts. It’s crucial for investors to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. While ‘Extreme Greed’ can signal exciting times, it also calls for a disciplined approach to risk management, especially concerning your exposure to the Bitcoin price and other digital assets. Navigating Market Volatility: Strategies for Extreme Greed In a market defined by ‘Extreme Greed’ and surging market volatility , adopting a strategic approach is more critical than ever. While the allure of quick gains is strong, uncontrolled enthusiasm can lead to significant losses if the market suddenly reverses course. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these choppy waters: Don’t Chase Pumps: Resist the urge to buy into assets that have already experienced parabolic rises. These often lead to “bag holding” when corrections occur. Take Partial Profits: If your portfolio has seen significant gains, consider taking some profits off the table. This could mean selling a portion of your holdings to secure initial investment or a percentage of your gains. Reinvesting these profits into less volatile assets or stablecoins can be a wise move. Rebalance Your Portfolio: As some assets surge, they might disproportionately increase their weight in your portfolio. Rebalancing by selling some of the outperformers and reallocating to underperformers (or simply reducing overall exposure) can help maintain your desired risk level. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, setting stop-loss orders can limit potential losses if the market turns. This is particularly important in high-volatility environments. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on social media hype. Understand the fundamentals of the projects you invest in. During ‘Extreme Greed’, many low-quality projects can pump alongside legitimate ones. Maintain a Cash Position: Having some stablecoin or fiat reserves allows you to capitalize on potential dips or corrections, which are common even in bull markets. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between your long-term investment strategy and any short-term trading activities. Don’t let short-term greed compromise your long-term goals. Managing market volatility during periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ is about balancing optimism with prudence. It’s about being prepared for both continued upside and potential downturns. Benefits and Challenges of a High Greed Environment The current state of ‘Extreme Greed’, as indicated by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 79, presents both exciting opportunities and significant risks for investors. Understanding these dual aspects is key to making informed decisions. Benefits: Profit Potential: The most obvious benefit is the potential for rapid and substantial gains. Assets can appreciate quickly as more capital flows into the market. Increased Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and increased participation mean better liquidity, making it easier to buy and sell assets. Innovation and Adoption: Bull markets often spur greater interest in the underlying technology, attracting talent and fostering innovation within the crypto space. Mainstream Attention: High prices and positive sentiment draw mainstream media attention, which can further accelerate adoption and understanding of cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Increased Risk of Correction: The primary challenge is the heightened risk of a sharp market correction. When everyone is greedy, there are fewer buyers left, and a small trigger can lead to a significant sell-off. Irrational Exuberance: Investors may make decisions based on emotion rather than sound analysis, leading to poor investment choices in speculative assets. Scams and Rug Pulls: Periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ often see a proliferation of scams and fraudulent projects looking to capitalize on investor FOMO. Difficulty in Entry/Exit: For new investors, entering at peak greed can mean buying at inflated prices. For existing holders, knowing when to exit can be challenging due to the psychological pull of continued gains. Market Volatility: While opportunities exist, the inherent market volatility can lead to significant swings, requiring strong emotional discipline. Navigating this environment requires a balanced perspective, acknowledging the upside while remaining acutely aware of the inherent risks that come with pervasive Extreme Greed . Conclusion: Riding the Wave with Caution The surge of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 79, placing the market firmly in the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone, is a clear signal that optimism is currently at an all-time high. This improved crypto market sentiment has undeniably fueled the recent rally in Bitcoin price and the broader altcoin market, creating exciting opportunities for many. However, history has shown us that periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ are often inflection points. While the current momentum is strong, it’s also a time when market volatility can be at its peak, and irrational decisions are more likely to occur. As an investor, your goal should be to leverage the positive sentiment while safeguarding against potential downturns. By understanding how the index is calculated, recognizing the psychological drivers behind ‘Extreme Greed’, and implementing disciplined strategies like profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing, you can navigate this thrilling yet precarious phase of the crypto market with greater confidence.

2025-07-12T11:59:08,"Why Pi Network Is Delaying KYC Approvals and Rewards","The post Why Pi Network Is Delaying KYC Approvals and Rewards appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After years of waiting, Pi Network has come a long way, but the journey isn’t over yet. While the foundation is mostly complete, the ecosystem still isn’t ready to fully support large-scale DApp use or economic activity. At the same time, many users are frustrated by delays in KYC approvals, migrations, and promised rewards. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dr Altcoin believes these delays might be part of a bigger plan to protect Pi’s future. Real Reason for the Hold-Up According to Dr Altcoin , the Pi Core Team (PCT) has finished most of the groundwork needed to run the network. It took them over six years to reach this point, but the project is not yet fully ready to handle large-scale DApps or true peer-to-peer transactions at a larger scale. Another important factor is the so-called “price discovery phase.” Right now, Pi Coin is still finding its true market price. The price has fallen from around $3 down to as low as $0.40 . Meanwhile, Dr Altcoin says the Pi Core Team wants to see Pi trading above $10 before allowing full peer-to-peer use. Until that happens, they’re holding off to avoid a market crash. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Pi Network Coin Price is Dropping , Strategic Delay to Prevent Mass Selling It’s no secret that many people are holding onto Pi just because of pending rewards, KYC approvals, and migration. If all those coins were released today, a huge number of users might immediately sell, causing a big drop in price and weakening the community. By delaying these, the team is buying time for Pi’s value to grow stronger. Dr Altcoin even hints that long-term token locking or burning some coins might be used in the future to push the price up. Playing the Long Game However, Dr Altcoin suggests that he’s focusing on the long run, believing Pi’s big promise will be worth it. If the plan works, the network could reach real peer-to-peer utility, stronger prices, and maybe help loyal holders achieve financial freedom. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to Dr. Altcoin, the Pi Core Team (PCT) has completed the network’s foundation but is delaying full DApp and peer-to-peer functionality because the ecosystem isn’t ready for large-scale use and Pi Coin hasn’t reached its target “price discovery phase” of over $10. What is the long-term vision for Pi Network? Dr. Altcoin believes the long-term plan aims for Pi Network to achieve real peer-to-peer utility, stronger prices, and potentially help loyal holders achieve financial freedom. Future strategies might include long-term token locking or burning. Is Pi coin a good investment?

2025-07-12T11:56:13,"Financial Expert Sends Critical Warning to XRP Holders Amid Major Rally","As XRP continues to surge in value, private banker and financial strategist Sidney M Brewer has issued an impassioned warning to the XRP community: do not sell. In a video shared on X, Brewer emphasized that XRP is not merely a digital asset; it is the foundation of a coming financial revolution. His message comes as XRP trades at $2.84, having gained over 30% in the past 10 days, outperforming much of the altcoin market and even outpacing Bitcoin’s recent growth. With Bitcoin currently at $118,500.16, investor attention is once again shifting toward Ripple’s ecosystem. XRP’s Role in the New Financial System According to Brewer, the global financial structure is on the brink of transformation, with XRP playing a pivotal role in this shift. He argues that the legacy financial system, built on fiat currency and central bank control, is being phased out in favor of a tokenized, blockchain-driven future. XRP- Holders listen very carefully! This is bigger than you! DO NOT SELL! pic.twitter.com/IQpntaVfry — Sidney M Brewer (@SidneyMBrewer) July 11, 2025 “Cash is not king,” Brewer asserted. “Your promissory notes aren’t worth the paper or plastic they’re printed on. What’s coming down the pipeline is XRP.” Brewer claims his network of private banking institutions across Canada and the U.S. has spent the last two years preparing for this shift, establishing Special Purpose Corporations (SPCs) and private loan trust companies. Their goal is to create a parallel financial system that enables interest-free loans, replaces debt-based financing, and allows for the tokenization of assets on the blockchain. Why Selling XRP Could Be a Critical Mistake Brewer’s central message is a clear and urgent warning: under no circumstances should holders sell their XRP . He argues that doing so not only weakens the position of the XRP community but also hands control of the asset back to the very financial powers that have perpetuated global debt systems. “There are two sides to this game,” he explained. “On one side are the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and traditional central banks. On the other hand, our side is building a system to empower people. If you sell your XRP, you’re giving them control.” He urged every XRP holder to store a minimum of 10,000 XRP units in cold storage, insisting that those who do will be “grandfathered” into a new private trust system that allows for strategic leveraging of XRP without selling it. Brewer believes XRP should be used as collateral to access liquidity, rather than being cashed out for short-term gains. Education, Tokenization, and Long-Term Wealth Brewer highlighted the importance of education in this new economic era. He criticized retail investors for chasing profits without understanding the long-term implications of their actions. “They’ll think they’re rich, buy houses and cars, then get slammed with taxes and regret,” he said. “They don’t know how to play the game.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Brewer advocates for asset tokenization, where homes, businesses, and other assets are converted into digital tokens as a means to preserve and grow wealth. This approach would allow individuals to access value without selling assets, thereby avoiding traditional finance’s debt traps. A Warning for the Impatient As XRP approaches the critical $3.00 resistance level, Brewer warned that many will panic sell during short-term price spikes, only to lose out on the full potential of what’s to come. “You’re going to panic when it jumps a couple of bucks,” he said. “ But if you sell now, you’ll miss the transfer of wealth that’s coming, and your children will pay the price. ” With thousands of new millionaires expected to emerge in the coming weeks, Brewer’s final advice is resolute: “Even if you get a letter from God signed by Jesus and approved by Moses, do not sell. Hold your XRP outside the system. We got this.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-12T11:51:31,"Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 12 July, 2025","The post Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 12 July, 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s been a packed week in crypto. Ripple grabbed headlines again, Ethereum got a corporate boost, and the Fed may be facing a shake-up of its own. It’s a mix of regulation, big money, and even bigger signals about where the market could be headed. Here are the top stories you need to know. #1 Fed Chair Jerome Powell May Resign Jerome Powell may be preparing to step down as Chair of the Federal Reserve. Fannie Mae Chairman William Pulte said he’s “encouraged by reports” of Powell’s possible resignation, adding it would help the economy “boom.” The pressure has been building. President Trump has sharply criticised Powell’s refusal to cut rates, calling it a costly mistake, and saying he is “terrible”. Powell also faces accusations of misleading Congress over a $2.5 billion Fed renovation. Lawmakers are now calling for a formal investigation. A decision could impact both markets and crypto flows. #2 Justin Sun Commits $100M to Trump Memecoin Justin Sun plans to buy $100 million worth of Donald Trump’s memecoin, just days before a $474 million token unlock. The Tron founder made the announcement on X, calling it a step to “grow the crypto landscape with communities such as GetTrumpMemes.” The move comes as the token prepares to launch on the Tron blockchain. Sun’s history with Trump-linked projects runs deep – including over $90 million spent across earlier ventures. It’s still unclear whether the funds will come from him directly or through the Tron DAO. We are committed to buying $100M of $TRUMP ! Together, $TRUMP and #TRON are the future of Crypto. This move highlights our belief in collaborating across ecosystems to grow the crypto landscape with communities such as @GetTrumpMemes . $TRUMP on #TRON is the currency of #MAGA !… — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) July 9, 2025 #3 Ripple CEO Becomes One of Crypto’s Wealthiest Leaders Brad Garlinghouse is now among crypto’s richest figures, with an estimated net worth of $10 billion. The Ripple CEO’s equity and XRP holdings saw a sharp boost following Ripple’s partial legal win against the U.S. SEC. The company settled for $50 million – far less than the original demand. Garlinghouse, who has led Ripple since 2016, continues to push for crypto-friendly regulations and stronger global partnerships. #4 Musk Names Bitcoin in America Party Agenda Bitcoin gained fresh momentum after Elon Musk confirmed it will be part of his new America Party’s official platform. “Fiat is hopeless so yes,” he said when asked about supporting BTC, a remark that quickly pushed Bitcoin close to $110,000. Dogecoin also jumped 6%. The move follows Musk’s split from the Republican Party over Trump’s controversial $3.3 trillion tax bill. With Tesla still holding over 11,500 BTC, Musk’s stance adds new political weight to Bitcoin’s future in the U.S. #5 Japan’s Metaplanet to Use Bitcoin for Business Acquisitions Japan’s Metaplanet is entering the next phase of its Bitcoin strategy. After adding 2,205 BTC this week, the Tokyo-based company now holds 15,555 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder outside North America. Metaplanet will now use its Bitcoin holdings as collateral to finance acquisitions of profitable businesses. “We need to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can… to reach escape velocity,” said CEO Simon Gerovich. The company has set a bold target: 210,000 BTC by 2027. #6 WazirX, Binance Face Heat as FIU Flags Terror Finance Concerns India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is investigating Binance and WazirX over concerns that crypto transfers may be linked to cross-border terror financing. The focus is on unhosted wallets possibly connected to Pakistan, with increased activity flagged in sensitive regions like Jammu & Kashmir. Binance is cooperating with authorities, a year after settling a ₹18 crore penalty to resume operations in India. WazirX is also under scrutiny, with an upcoming Singapore court hearing and claims that TRX tokens may have been used to fund ISIS-linked activity. #7 Ripple Picks Top U.S. Bank to Strengthen RLUSD Trust Ripple has partnered with BNY Mellon to custody reserves for its stablecoin, RLUSD – a move that boosts regulatory credibility and institutional trust. The announcement came as RLUSD crosses a $500 million market cap just seven months after launch. BNY Mellon will handle reserve assets like cash and U.S. Treasuries. “We are thrilled to support the growth and adoption of RLUSD,” said BNY Mellon’s Emily Portney. Ripple is also pursuing a U.S. banking charter and Fed master account. #8 Nasdaq Firm Goes All-In on Ethereum, Dumps BTC Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-listed firm, has sold off all 280 of its Bitcoin to build a massive Ethereum treasury. After raising $172 million in a public offering, the company now holds over 100,600 ETH, aiming to become the largest corporate holder of Ether. CEO Sam Tabar said the move reflects Ethereum’s long-term value, citing smart contracts and staking rewards. Bit Digital’s stock jumped nearly 18%, as markets responded to the strategy. #9 TON’s Viral Golden Visa Pitch Got Denied by UAE Toncoin surged nearly 12% after TON Foundation’s CEO claimed that staking $100,000 worth of the token could get investors a UAE Golden Visa. But UAE authorities quickly denied it. The country’s top regulators – ICP, SCA, and VARA – issued a joint statement calling the claim false, clarifying that TON is not licensed or approved in Dubai. No such visa route exists for crypto investors. #10 Tokenized Securities Still Count as Securities, Says SEC SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” has warned that tokenizing assets doesn’t change their legal status. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” she said. Her comments come amid rising interest in blockchain-based stocks, with firms like Coinbase seeking approval to offer tokenized equities. Peirce also flagged risks tied to third-party tokens, saying buyers could face added legal and financial uncertainty. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! South Korea to Grant Crypto Startups Venture Status: A new government proposal could give digital asset firms access to tax breaks, funding, and loan guarantees for the first time under the national venture ecosystem. New Zealand Bans Crypto ATMs in Money Laundering Crackdown: Authorities halt 220+ crypto kiosks and limit overseas transfers to $5,000, aiming to tighten controls on illicit fund flows and boost financial crime enforcement. Trump Media Files for ‘Crypto Blue Chip ETF’ with SEC : The proposed fund would track five major tokens including Solana and XRP, with Crypto.com set to serve as digital custodian if approved. Hong Kong’s Stablecoin License Race Draws 40+ Global Players: Top firms like JD.com, Ant Group, and Circle are competing for fewer than 10 stablecoin licenses as Hong Kong rolls out its new digital asset regime this August. Tether CEO Says “We Will Be the Largest Bitcoin Miner by End of 2025”: The USDT issuer is expanding fast with 15+ sites across Latin America, betting big on mining to protect its reserves and meet stricter stablecoin rules under the GENIUS Act. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead Bitcoin could see fresh institutional flows as political endorsements stack up, from Musk’s America Party platform to Japan’s Metaplanet doubling down on BTC-backed acquisitions. Ripple’s stablecoin ambitions may accelerate now that BNY Mellon is on board. With a $500M cap hit and U.S. bank charter in progress, RLUSD could push deeper into regulated finance. Ethereum’s corporate appeal is gaining ground, as Bit Digital ditches BTC for ETH to bet on staking and smart contracts. Tokenization efforts may face more resistance after SEC’s Hester Peirce reaffirmed that digital wrappers don’t dodge securities laws. Platforms like Coinbase will need sharper legal strategies. Memecoins may blur lines between community hype and political narrative, as Justin Sun’s $100M pledge to Trump’s token raises new questions.

2025-07-12T11:45:44,"Financial Giant Handing up to $5,000 per Person in Data Breach Settlement After Names, Social Security Numbers and More Exposed","A global financial giant has agreed to compensate those who were impacted by a major 2024 data breach. According to the newly updated settlement portal, Prudential Financial (PRU) will provide up to $5,000 to those impacted by a cybersecurity attack in February 2024. The class action lawsuit alleges that in February 2024, hackers were able to enter Prudential’s systems and gain access to files containing customers’ personal information, including names, dates of birth, account numbers, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. Says the agreement, “Prudential will establish a Settlement Fund of $4.75 million. The Settlement Fund will first be used to pay court-approved attorneys’ fees and costs, service award for the plaintiffs and the costs of administering the settlement. All of the remaining funds will be used to pay for the benefits described below. You may claim one of the following benefits: Documented out-of-pocket losses. Social Security number/tax identification number impact payments. CCPA Payments (available to California residents only). Pro rata cash payment.” For out-of-pocket losses, claimants can receive up to $5,000. The losses must have occurred between February 4th, 2024, and October 3rd, 2025, and could include fees for credit reports, credit monitoring, freezing and unfreezing credit, cost to replace IDs, as well as charges incurred from actual identity theft, fraud or other misuse of personal information. Claims must be filed by October 3rd. Class action attorneys are asking the court for $1.59 million in fees from the Settlement Fund and a $2,000 service award for each of the class representatives.

Is it same like Crypto Purpose? 8 Key Uses Explained Beyond Investment For many, the term “crypto” immediately brings to mind images of volatile charts and high-risk investments. While its role as an investment vehicle is significant, the true crypto purpose extends far beyond speculation. Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary technology with a multifaceted mission to reshape finance, enhance privacy, and provide access to a global digital economy. This article delves into the core functions of cryptocurrency, moving past the hype to explore its fundamental uses. From acting as a new form of money to empowering the unbanked, we will unpack the eight key purposes of crypto and also address the critical risks that every user must understand. Table of Contents What is Cryptocurrency? A Quick Refresher The Core Crypto Purpose: 8 Key Functions Unpacked Navigating the Risks: The Critical Considerations of Crypto Conclusion: A Technology of Potential and Prudence Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is Cryptocurrency? A Quick Refresher Before diving into its purpose, let’s clarify what “crypto” is. Short for cryptocurrency, it’s a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (like the U.S. Dollar or the Indian Rupee), crypto operates on a decentralized system called a blockchain. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, was the first, but thousands of others, known as “altcoins,” have since been created. Each has unique features, but they all share the foundational principle of operating independently from a central bank or single authority. The Core Crypto Purpose ( crypto pur ): 8 Key Functions Unpacked Understanding the true crypto purpose requires looking at its diverse applications. Here are eight of its most important functions: 1. A Modern Medium of Exchange At its most basic level, crypto is designed to be a form of digital cash. It can be used to purchase goods and services online and, increasingly, at physical stores. This peer-to-peer system allows value to be transferred directly from one person to another without needing a bank to process the transaction. 2. A High-Growth Investment Vehicle This is the most well-known use. Many people buy cryptocurrencies hoping their value will appreciate significantly over time. While highly volatile, the potential for high returns has attracted millions of investors worldwide, making crypto a prominent, albeit risky, asset class. 3. A Tool for Global Financial Inclusion Billions of people worldwide lack access to traditional banking services. The only requirements to use crypto are an internet connection and a digital wallet. This opens the door for underserved populations to participate in the global financial system, save money, and make transactions securely. 4. Faster & Cheaper Global Transactions Traditional international bank transfers can take 3-5 business days and often involve high fees. Cryptocurrency transactions can be settled in minutes, regardless of geography, and typically at a fraction of the cost. This makes it a powerful tool for remittances and international trade. 5. Power Through Decentralization Because cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any single government or company, they offer users a degree of financial autonomy. This decentralization makes the network resistant to censorship or manipulation by a central authority, a key philosophical pillar of the crypto movement. For more on this, major financial publications like Forbes often discuss the implications of decentralization. 6. A Potential Hedge Against Inflation Some cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, have a fixed supply limit. For Bitcoin, only 21 million coins will ever exist. This scarcity leads some investors to believe it can act as a “digital gold”—a store of value that is resistant to inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of traditional, government-issued currencies. 7. Radical Transparency with Blockchain Most cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology, which is a public, distributed ledger. Every transaction is recorded on this ledger and is visible to anyone. This transparency can help prevent fraud and corruption, as all movements of funds are open for public scrutiny. 8. Enhanced User Privacy While all transactions are public, the identities of the parties involved are pseudonymous—represented by a cryptographic wallet address, not personal information. This provides a layer of privacy that is often greater than traditional banking systems, where personal data is collected and stored by a central institution. Navigating the Risks: The Critical Considerations of Crypto No discussion of the crypto purpose is complete without addressing its significant risks. Before engaging with digital assets, it’s crucial to be aware of the following: Extreme Volatility: Prices can and do fluctuate dramatically in very short periods. It’s not uncommon for a cryptocurrency’s value to swing by over 10% in a single day. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments around the world are still deciding how to regulate cryptocurrencies. New laws could significantly impact their value and legality. Security Risks: If you lose your private keys (the password to your digital wallet), you lose access to your funds forever. Hacking of exchanges and scams are also prevalent threats. Environmental Impact: The “mining” process for some major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, is energy-intensive and has raised significant environmental concerns. If you are considering investing, it is essential to conduct thorough research. You can [ read our detailed guide on “How to Invest in Cryptocurrency Safely” ]([Internal Link Placeholder]) to learn more. Conclusion: A Technology of Potential and Prudence The purpose of crypto is rich and varied. It is simultaneously a new financial system, an investment asset, a political statement about decentralization, and a practical tool for global transactions. Its potential to reshape our digital world is immense, but it is accompanied by equally significant risks. Understanding both sides of this powerful technology is the first step toward navigating its landscape safely and effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is the main purpose of cryptocurrency? The main purpose of cryptocurrency is to act as a secure, decentralized digital currency that can be used for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority like a bank. It also serves as an investment asset and a tool for financial inclusion. Is crypto only for investment? No. While many people use crypto for investment, its core functions include acting as a medium of exchange for goods and services, enabling cheaper and faster international remittances, and providing financial services to those without access to traditional banks. What are the biggest risks of using crypto? The biggest risks include extreme price volatility, the potential for total loss of funds through security breaches or losing private keys, and an uncertain regulatory environment where new laws could negatively impact the market. How does crypto provide privacy? Crypto provides privacy through pseudonymity. While transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, they are tied to a cryptographic address, not a person’s real-world identity. This makes it more private than traditional banking, which requires sharing personal information. This post What is crypto pur?

2025-07-12T11:35:38,"Crypto Investor Ryan Sean Adams Calls Ethereum the Next World Reserve Asset","The post Crypto Investor Ryan Sean Adams Calls Ethereum the Next World Reserve Asset appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has finally broken above the key $2,850 resistance level , jumping 15% this week to trade around $2,955. The move has stirred fresh excitement across the altcoin market, with rising trading volume hinting that a new altseason might be underway – a period where altcoins outperform Bitcoin and deliver bigger gains. With Ethereum reclaiming major technical levels and a strong new narrative building, many investors are starting to ask: Is ETH stepping into a much bigger role in the global financial system? “Blue Money” Revolution: Ethereum’s Bold Rebrand Ryan Sean Adams, founder of Mythos Capital, is one of the most vocal supporters of Ethereum’s evolving identity. In a recent post on X, he credited the community’s efforts: “The ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months.” Adams’ “blue money” concept recasts Ethereum not just as infrastructure for decentralized apps , but as a yield-generating, store-of-value asset backed by a real on-chain economy. While Bitcoin is seen as digital gold and oil remains a classic store of value, ETH offers something more – security and productivity. His big idea? Ethereum has the potential to become a global reserve asset and that’s now catching the attention of both retail and institutional investors. The ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months. We are emphasizing ETH the asset now. A store of value like gold, oil, and bitcoin – but backed by an economy with yield. It's made a huge difference. Keep going. ETH = world reserve asset https://t.co/e9GD4YeKNQ — RYAN SΞAN ADAMS – rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) July 11, 2025 Breaking Out: ETH Regains Key Support Zones After weeks of moving sideways, ETH has broken through with strength, reclaiming both the 100-week and 200-week moving averages , currently sitting at $2,644 and $2,428. This kind of technical reclaim often signals that a downtrend could be over and a new bullish phase is beginning. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 12 July, 2025 , The $2,850 level has long been a major zone of resistance and support. With ETH now trading above it, analysts are eyeing the next targets at $3,300 to $3,600. If momentum holds, a push toward $4,000 is well within reach. Despite this progress, ETH is still trading about 60% below its all-time high of nearly $4,900 from November 2021, leaving plenty of room for upside if this rally continues. Ethereum’s Comeback Opportunity Since 2022, Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin, frustrating many holders. While BTC has hit fresh all-time highs, ETH is still playing catch-up. But that underperformance is now being seen as a potential opportunity. Adams believes the market is starting to take a fresh look at ETH. “We are emphasizing ETH, the asset now,” he wrote on X, urging the community to keep building on this momentum. If the idea of Ethereum as a reserve asset gains wider support, it could help ETH close the gap with Bitcoin and even shift the balance of power across the crypto market. Altcoins Follow Ethereum’s Lead Ethereum’s breakout is lifting the rest of the altcoin market too, with several tokens showing strong gains in its wake. This kind of broad move often signals confidence returning to riskier parts of the market and positions ETH as the trendsetter for the altcoin space. Still, the rally isn’t without risk. If ETH drops back below $2,850, the recent momentum could fade, and lower support levels may be tested again. But for now, Ethereum is leading the charge. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-12T11:29:38,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC At Record Levels As It Heads Into Crucial “Crypto Week”","Bitcoin (BTC) set a fresh record on Friday, surging to $118,856 as the flagship cryptocurrency’s record-breaking rally continues. BTC bulls have set their eyes on the $120,000 mark as the flagship cryptocurrency heads into a crucial week with the price at record levels. Price action has slowed down over the past 24 hours, with the price marginally down, trading around $118,139. Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Triggers $1.2 billion in Liquidations Bitcoin’s (BTC) record-breaking rally has led to over $1 billion in bearish positions liquidated over the past 24 hours. Over 279,000 traders were liquidated as the flagship cryptocurrency raced to its latest all-time high. According to data from Coinglass, the largest liquidation, valued at around $88 million, occurred on HTX. Augustine Fan, partner at crypto trading platform SignalPlus, stated, “The conditions for a slow grind higher have been in place for some time. Today’s move appears to be a product of that setup.” Bitcoin was trading in a tight range since May but broke out of it on Thursday after President Trump unleashed his latest trade salvo, sending stocks into a tizzy. BTC crossed $115,000 by Thursday and surged past $118,000 on Friday as bullish sentiment returned to crypto. Several factors are fueling the latest rally, including record ETF inflows and a Congressional committee declaring next week as “Crypto Week.” There are also indications that China is rethinking its stance on digital assets. A Crucial Week For Bitcoin (BTC) And Crypto Bitcoin (BTC) heads into a landmark week for the crypto industry, with the US House of Representatives set to discuss three crucial crypto bills, which could provide much-needed regulatory clarity. Lawmakers will discuss the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, with signs that recently strained ties between Washington and the crypto industry are beginning to thaw. A regulatory framework could encourage companies to adopt Bitcoin into their treasury strategy, following the lead set by firms like Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR). The GENIUS Act will allow private companies to issue stablecoins. President Trump has already announced his support for the bill on social media. Meanwhile, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act will establish a framework for crypto regulation. The third bill, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Investors are lining up to take positions ahead of next week. Analysts expect that capital previously sidelined due to regulatory uncertainty will re-enter the market. Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex, believes even if the final passage of the bills stalls, the optics of legislative engagement could push the market higher. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) reached new highs on three consecutive days, with the flagship cryptocurrency’s market dominance sitting around 64%, down 1.53% over the past week.
