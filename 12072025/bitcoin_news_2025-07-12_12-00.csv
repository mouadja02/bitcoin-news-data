2025-07-12T09:57:15,"Crypto Bull Run Gains Momentum, Here’s When Altcoin Season Might Start","The post Crypto Bull Run Gains Momentum, Here’s When Altcoin Season Might Start appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has officially broken past the $118,000 mark, hitting a new all-time high. Crypto analyst Virtual Bacon believes this is the beginning of a major bull cycle. However, he warns that altseason has not yet arrived. Here’s what’s happening, what to watch for, and why investors should stay patient. Bitcoin Bull Run Over the last seven days, Bitcoin has climbed 8.8%. So far this month, the price has jumped nearly 10%, touching a new all-time high of $118,000 . Virtual Bacon considers this breakout a major bullish signal and believes it marks the start of a new bull market. He points out that Bitcoin typically leads during early bull phases, with altcoins following once liquidity shifts. “Bitcoin’s breakout confirms the beginning of a new cycle,” he wrote on X . Bitcoin’s current support levels: 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA): $86,982 20-week SMA: $96,719 (a proven dip-buying zone) Altcoin Season Is Close, But Not Confirmed Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.58%, down from 65.50% on July 1. While this slight drop is a good sign, altseason typically begins after a sustained fall in BTC dominance. Virtual Bacon points out early indicators: Ethereum’s price against BTC has jumped 10.53% this month ETH/BTC now trades at 0.02516, up from 0.02276 A strong weekly close above 0.024 could signal a true breakout From July 5 to 10, ETH/BTC surged by 9.49%, although it saw a minor correction of 1.08% afterward. The strength in ETH and SOL is encouraging but not yet a confirmation of full altcoin rotation. Fed Quietly Injecting Liquidity into Markets A major factor supporting the crypto rally is the Federal Reserve’s quiet liquidity injection. Virtual Bacon outlines two major moves: $11 billion repo injection on June 30 A proposal to reduce the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) for large banks. These actions boost bank reserves and allow for more lending, which increases liquidity in the broader financial system. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : BitcoinTalk User Turns $500 to $10M After Unlocking 2012 Bitcoin Bar , Additionally, the Global Liquidity Index is making a higher low. If it breaks above its April and September 2024 highs, it could confirm expanding liquidity—another condition needed for altseason. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 17. Reports suggest there is a 64% chance of a rate cut in Q4 2025, which could further fuel crypto momentum. Final Thoughts: Wait for Confirmation Before Diving Into Altcoins While Bitcoin’s breakout is undeniable and the early signs for altcoins are positive, Virtual Bacon advises caution. A confirmed altseason requires: Sustained BTC dominance drop Breakout in ETH/BTC Full expansion in global liquidity Investors are advised to avoid jumping into low-cap altcoins prematurely. Instead, focus on large-cap coins showing early strength and wait for more macro confirmation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As of press time on July 12, XRP’s market capitalization stood at $163.98 billion, up from $131.41 billion a week earlier, an increase of about $32.57 billion. Notably, XRP peaked at $171.88 billion on July 11. XRP one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap This momentum has also lifted XRP’s price, which is now testing the $3 resistance zone. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $2.77, up nearly 25% over the last seven days and more than 7% on the daily chart. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Why XRP is rallying XRP’s rally has been fueled by its ability to track broader market sentiment, which has seen Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high above $118,000. Technically, XRP’s break above the $2.30 resistance level helped unlock further capital inflows. At the same time, on-chain data from analytics platform Santiment shared on July 11 shows that with XRP approaching $3, market interest has picked up notably. For example, 6,939 new XRP wallets were created in a single day, the highest daily figure since March 1. Additionally, social media activity has also spiked, with XRP now featuring in over 5.5% of all cryptocurrency-related discussions, a level last seen on March 18. XRP network activity chart. Source: Santiment XRP fundamentals Beyond technical drivers, institutional developments have buoyed sentiment. For instance, Ripple’s stablecoin , RLUSD, is seeing increased adoption in cross-border remittances, highlighted by Visa’s partnership with Yellow Card to facilitate settlements in Africa. In addition, XRP’s momentum has been supported by growing anticipation of a potential resolution in the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), with signs the two parties are moving closer to a settlement. Speculation around the possible approval of an XRP spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) has further fueled interest, as institutional investors eye the asset’s potential.

2025-07-12T09:35:17,"Top Crypto Tax-Free Countries in 2025","The post Top Crypto Tax-Free Countries in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto adoption has surged in 2025, but taxes remain a major concern for traders and investors. While most countries now impose strict regulations and high tax rates, a few nations still offer zero-tax regimes, making them global hubs for crypto startups, traders, and digital nomads. Here’s a look at the top crypto tax-free countries in 2025 and the worst countries to trade crypto if you want to hold on to your profits. Best Tax-Free Crypto Countries in 2025 Country Crypto Tax Rate / Status Cayman Islands 0% (No income, capital gains, or corporate tax) United Arab Emirates 0% (Tax-free on trading, staking, mining) El Salvador 0% (No capital gains or income tax on Bitcoin) Germany 0% (If held for over 12 months) Singapore 0% (Capital gains tax exempt) Malaysia 0% (Occasional trading only) Bermuda 0% (No income or capital gains tax) Belarus 0% (No income or capital gains tax) Malta 0% (Long-term gains only; corporate tax may apply) Cayman Islands The Cayman Islands is widely considered a crypto tax haven. There are no personal income taxes, capital gains taxes, or corporate taxes . This makes it ideal for long-term crypto holders, DeFi investors, and crypto businesses. United Arab Emirates The UAE has emerged as a top crypto-friendly country. Crypto trading, staking, mining, and NFT transactions are all tax-free . Although tax policies can vary across emirates, the overall regulatory environment is clear and pro-crypto. El Salvador Under its Digital Assets Law, El Salvador imposes zero capital gains and income tax on Bitcoin transactions . The government-backed Chivo wallet and the planned “Bitcoin City” add to its appeal for crypto investors and miners. Germany While not fully tax-free, Germany allows tax-free crypto sales after a 12-month holding period . If you hold Bitcoin or other digital assets for a year or more, you pay no tax when you sell, swap, or spend them. Singapore Singapore has no capital gains tax, making crypto trading and selling tax-free for most investors. However, if you earn crypto as payment for goods or services, it may be subject to income tax. Malaysia Malaysia does not impose capital gains tax, so occasional crypto trading is tax-free . However, frequent traders may be treated as professionals and taxed under income tax laws. Bermuda Bermuda offers a zero percent tax rate on crypto income, capital gains, and investment returns. It remains a top choice for crypto investors and businesses seeking regulatory clarity. Belarus Belarus has legalized crypto and offers no income or capital gains tax on crypto transactions for individuals and businesses. The government is actively supporting blockchain innovation. Malta Malta is known for its crypto-friendly laws. No tax is applied on long-term gains if crypto is used as a store of value. However, frequent trading can be taxed under business income laws, with corporate tax rates up to 35%. Some entities may reduce this to as low as 5% depending on structure. Worst Countries for Crypto Taxes in 2025 Country Crypto Tax Rate India 30% capital gains + 1% TDS Spain Up to 47% on income, 28% on gains Netherlands 32% tax on presumed gains Denmark 40% personal income tax South Africa Up to 18% capital gains + 45% income tax India India has imposed a flat 30% capital gains tax on all crypto earnings and a 1% TDS on transactions. There’s no deduction for losses , making the regime one of the most aggressive globally. Spain Spain taxes high-income crypto users at 47% and applies a 28% capital gains tax on profits over €300,000. Crypto earnings from staking, DeFi, or mining are taxed as regular income. Netherlands The Netherlands applies a 32% tax on presumed gains , even if crypto assets aren’t sold. This applies to digital asset portfolios exceeding €300,000, regardless of trading activity. Denmark Denmark imposes a 40% personal income tax on crypto gains . Loss offsets are limited—only 30% of losses can be deducted from taxable gains. South Africa Crypto in South Africa is subject to 18% capital gains tax and up to 45% income tax . Lack of clear guidance on DeFi, airdrops, or forks adds confusion for users and businesses. Countries That Banned Crypto but Have No Tax Policy These countries have no crypto tax laws , not because they’re tax havens, but because crypto is banned or heavily restricted : China Egypt Bangladesh Algeria Iraq Ethiopia Crypto use is not legally allowed in these nations, so tax rules are irrelevant. Conclusion In 2025, a growing number of countries are tightening their grip on cryptocurrency taxation. Yet, a few crypto-friendly countries continue to offer tax-free regimes, attracting serious investors and major Web3 firms. Countries like Portugal , once tax-free, now impose crypto taxes, proving how fast the global landscape can change.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/top-crypto-tax-free-countries-in-2025/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING|ASIA|BTC","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T09:15:50,"Will Bitcoin and AVAX Dominate Q3, or Will Retail Rotate to Meme Favorites Like Dogecoin?","The opening days of Q3 feel like the start of a boxing match: Bitcoin in one corner, institutional capital behind it; Avalanche (AVAX) in another, promising faster settlements; and a rowdy crowd of meme coins, spearheaded by Dogecoin, taunting both heavyweights from the ringside. Analysts ask whether blue-chip names will keep control or if retail traders will again sprint toward lighter, wilder tokens. Into this clash steps MAGACOIN FINANCE, an up-and-coming political meme coin that claims it can marry narrative flair with solid fundamentals. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Steal the Spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE is an early-stage memecoin project backed by strong fundamentals and a viral community. On-chain trackers show a clear rise in unique wallets and a jump in average holding size as the project heads into Stage 3 of its presale, evidence that accumulation is replacing quick flips. Unlike many meme tokens, MAGACOIN backs its buzz with structure. The supply is permanently capped at 170 billion coins, a guardrail meant to avoid the dilution that haunts older memes. Governance remains venture-capital-free, so every material change rises and falls on community votes without risk of selling pressure due to VC unlocks. That bottom-up governance model reflects the coin’s political brand and has become a talking point in analyst notes that compare MAGACOIN’s cultural pull to Dogecoin’s early years. Bitcoin’s High-Pressure Summer Standard Chartered’s desk sees Bitcoin pressing toward $135,000 by late quarter, driven by ETF inflows and a fading dollar. Although other analysts caution that historical mid-year slumps and fresh geopolitical jitters could still derail the charge, the broader uptrend remains intact. If Bitcoin does push past the psychological $110,000 mark, past cycles suggest retail liquidity eventually trickles down the ladder, often igniting meme rallies a few weeks later. That timing matters to traders, whether to sit in the heavyweight champion or front-run the next rotation. Avalanche Looks for Its Cue Avalanche spent June around $17, with chart analysts flagging a potential breakout above $20 as a gateway to a steeper climb. Medium-term projections peg a $30–$35 band, which is plausible in early Q3 if ecosystem growth holds pace. Still, some research desks note that “smart money” has begun inching toward higher-beta plays in DeFi spin-offs, suggesting that AVAX may need fresh catalysts to keep attention once meme season revs up. Dogecoin and the Retail Pulse Dogecoin rarely stays silent for long. Although it is down more than 40% this year, experts still believe the original meme coin can have some quick turnaround with increased liquidity and spill-over energy from Bitcoin highs. History shows that liquidity splinters into newer memes within days whenever DOGE catches a bid, and there are already signs of large wallets reallocating away from DOGE toward “next-gen” meme plays with clearer narratives and tighter tokenomics. A Three-Way Tug-of-War Put side by side, Bitcoin offers perceived safety and a shot at a historic milestone. Avalanche AVAX provides a technological story and mid-cap upside, and Dogecoin and its meme entourage promise adrenaline. MAGACOIN FINANCE tries to fold parts of each recipe into one dish: the resonance of a cultural storyline, the discipline of a capped supply, and the practicality of zero transaction fees. If Bitcoin rallies first, as many expect, meme coins typically follow. Should that pattern repeat, a community-driven token with audit credentials might be the one that grabs the microphone when retail enthusiasm peaks. Did I hear someone say MAGACOIN Finance? Yes, that’s the token to eye!

2025-07-12T09:15:48,"AI Predicts When XRP Will Trade at $10","Google’s advanced AI model, Gemini, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over XRP’s price trajectory, offering a data-driven prediction that is already attracting attention. With XRP showing notable gains over the past week and Bitcoin’s exceptional year-to-date performance reinforcing bullish sentiment in the market, Gemini’s forecast comes at a time of growing optimism for the digital asset. Analysts are closely watching the interplay of market dynamics, regulatory shifts, and investor confidence, which together seem to be setting the stage for further appreciation. Recent Market Performance Points to Strength XRP is currently trading at $2.77, reflecting a 7% increase in the past 24 hours and a 24% gain over the past seven days. These moves mirror broader market strength, particularly evident in Bitcoin’s performance. Over the last year, Bitcoin has surged by more than 106%, rising from $57,000 to $177,800, and has climbed an additional 9% in just the last week. This sustained momentum in Bitcoin often trickles down to altcoins, historically lifting XRP and other assets during bullish market cycles. Many observers believe that continued strength in Bitcoin could create favorable conditions for XRP to test higher levels. Another factor underpinning this renewed optimism is the resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit, which had clouded XRP’s regulatory status for years, concluded favorably for Ripple, easing investor concerns about potential enforcement risks. This development has been widely viewed as removing a major overhang on XRP’s price. Regulatory Climate Has Improved In addition to the lawsuit’s resolution, a recent analysis published in the Securing the Rights of Cryptocreditors journal highlighted the shifting regulatory environment as a critical element in XRP’s resurgence. The journal observed that “the change in the U.S. administration has paved the way for XRP to continue to increase in value,” citing a more crypto-friendly approach under President Trump’s administration and an overall recalibration of regulatory priorities. This shift has helped alleviate some of the pressure that had previously restrained XRP, allowing the market to reassess its long-term potential without the same degree of regulatory uncertainty.

According to Gemini, XRP is expected to trade at $10 by December. The AI model’s analysis incorporates current price momentum, the bullish environment in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, and the easing of regulatory risks as significant drivers of price appreciation over the coming months. “Based on technical indicators and market trend analysis, XRP has the potential to reach $10 by the end of this year,” Gemini’s forecast states. This projection represents a significant increase from current levels, but it aligns with the prevailing optimism among market participants who view XRP as undervalued relative to its utility and market position. As market conditions evolve, investors will continue to monitor how well XRP can sustain its upward trajectory and whether the factors identified by Google Gemini and other analysts will materialize as expected. For now, the combination of strong technical performance, improved regulatory clarity , and bullish sentiment appears to support the view that XRP’s upward momentum could carry it toward the $10 mark in the months ahead.

2025-07-12T09:15:34,"Bitcoin Could Explode by 112% Before End of Year, According to Analyst Michaël van de Poppe – But There’s a Catch","Analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) is primed to go much higher after the flagship crypto asset broke into a new all-time high. Van de Poppe tells his 795,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could reach a price of $250,000 in the fourth quarter – an increase of around 112% from the current level. According to the widely followed analyst, Bitcoin could hit a price of $125,000 this month and $150,000 between July and the end of September. However, Van de Poppe expects the rally to pause before his targets can be reached. “Probably going to stall for a little before we’ll continue.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading at $117,915 at time of writing, up by around 10% over the past week. Turning to Ethereum ( ETH ), the widely followed analyst says the second-largest crypto asset by market cap appears bullish and could rise to levels last witnessed in November of 2021. “A vertical candle upwards. Now, some patience and then we’ll continue to the all-time highs.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Ethereum is trading at $2,980 at time of writing, up by nearly 20% over the past seven days but down by approximately 40% from the all-time high reached close to four years ago. Lastly, Van de Poppe believes that the downtrend in the total market capitalization of altcoins versus Bitcoin is about to reverse . The widely followed analyst says altcoins are forming a bullish divergence against Bitcoin on the weekly time frame – an indication that altcoins are bottoming out against the flagship crypto asset. A bullish divergence occurs when the price of an asset is forming lower lows while an oscillator like the relative strength index (RSI) is forming higher highs.

2025-07-12T09:00:26,"US Treasury Officially Removes Controversial Biden-Era Crypto Broker Reporting Rules","The US Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have formally scrapped a controversial crypto rule that would have mandated decentralized exchanges to comply with broker reporting obligations. US Treasury, IRS Drop Crypto Broker Rule On Thursday, the US Department of the Treasury and the IRS officially revoked the crypto broker rules that required decentralized exchanges and protocols to report detailed customer data to the tax agency. The rule was originally proposed in November 2021 through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, aiming to close the “tax gap” by broadening the definition of “brokers” to include crypto exchanges and other intermediaries. At the end of the Biden administration, the IRS finalized the rule, expanding the definition of a “broker” while requiring DeFi platforms to report proceeds from digital asset transactions and detail user transaction information, including names and addresses. As reported by Bitcoinist, the regulation was set to take full effect in 2027 but faced heavy criticism. Industry players considered the policy to be “unworkable” and an overreach, noting that the “arbitrary” definition of a “broker” was too broad, and many market participants didn’t have access to the data the agency was requesting. In March, Congress passed a joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) disapproving of the final rule. The resolution, titled “Gross Proceeds Reporting by Brokers that Regularly Provide Services Effectuating Digital Asset Sales,” was signed by President Donald Trump in April, becoming the first crypto bill signed by a US president. Starting July 11, 2025, this crypto broker rule has no legal force or effect, as the Treasury Department and the IRS have removed it from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and reverted the relevant text of the CFR to the text that was in effect before the final rule. The federal agencies noted that the CFR change was made to reflect the accomplishments already achieved through congressional and presidential action. “Accordingly, the Treasury Department and the IRS are not soliciting comments on this action, nor are they delaying the effective date,” the revocation reads. Shift From Biden-Era Regulation The rule’s removal follows the regulatory shift under President Trump, who has vowed to turn America into the “crypto capital of the world.” Amid this process, other federal agencies have revoked other Biden-era rules and guidance. In May, the US Department of Labor (DOL) rescinded its 2022 guidance, which discouraged fiduciaries from including digital asset investments in 401(k) retirement plans. The direction, issued in March 2022, followed Biden’s executive order that required the government to assess the risks and benefits of digital assets. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not DC bureaucrats,” US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer explained. In June, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced it had updated its approach to bank examinations to remove “reputational risk” from its guidelines, easing crypto firms’ access to traditional banking. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have disbanded their crypto enforcement-focused units and changed their long-criticized “regulation by enforcement” approach. Notably, Congress is also working to advance the highly anticipated crypto framework, pushing for approval of the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, and the market structure legislation, the CLARITY Act, which will be the focus during the upcoming “Crypto Week.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-officially-removes-controversial-biden-era-crypto-broker-reporting-rules/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Broker rule|crypto exchanges|crypto guidance|crypto regulation|crypto rules|Crypto tax|IRS|US Treasury Department",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T08:52:38,"Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Leads the Charge Above $3,000 – Has Crypto Summer Season Officially Begun?","Ethereum (ETH) briefly touched $3,000 this weekend, and the market is feeling optimistic again. Currently at $2,969, ETH is showing a sustained breakout with high volume and bullish indicators. After weeks of steady gains, Crypto Summer may have finally arrived. ETH lost 0.41% in early weekend trading, but the trend is still intact. ETH is up 9% in the last 5 days and outperforming most altcoins. This is more than a short term spike, it’s institutional demand and growing confidence in Ethereum’s long term. SharpLink’s ETH Buy is Institutional Trust A big catalyst for this momentum is the $25.72 million private OTC deal between the Ethereum Foundation and Nasdaq listed SharpLink Gaming. The esports marketing firm bought 10,000 ETH at $2,572 per token, now holds 215,957 ETH worth over $600 million. SharpLink has acquired 10,000 $ETH directly from the ethereum foundation. They are now holding 215,000+ $ETH . pic.twitter.com/tQh94jUbXS — Satoshi Stacker (@StackerSatoshi) July 11, 2025 SharpLink’s CEO Joseph Lubin said the purchase is part of the company’s long term strategy, not speculative trading. The Ethereum Foundation said the OTC route was chosen to avoid market disruption, open market sales can be heavy on the price. Deal Size: 10,000 ETH for $25.72M Average Purchase Price: $2,572 Current Holding Value: Over $600M Market Reaction: SharpLink stock up 17% So institutional confidence is high and ETH is above $3,000 without profit taking. Investors see this as a vote of long term confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its utility across Web3, DeFi and tokenization. ETF Inflows Mean Strong Demand Ahead To top it off, U.S. spot ETH ETFs saw their second-largest daily inflow of $383.1 million at the end of last week. Total 5-day inflow is $851.73 million, and total inflows are over $5 billion ahead of their 1-year anniversary on July 23. BlackRock’s ETHA drew in $300.93 million in one day. The biggest $ETH ETF inflow in history just hit: $383M in a day. $12.5B now parked in Ethereum. Institutions are front-running the next leg. Still sidelined? You’re gonna feel it at $10,000. pic.twitter.com/eXiSvP20rP — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) July 12, 2025 These ETFs are not only absorbing supply but also helping ETH find price stability in a volatile market. Since Ethereum’s 2022 proof-of-stake transition, supply has been dwindling. Over the last nine trading days, ETF inflows have outpaced ETH supply, creating a supply squeeze. With crypto conferences and ETF milestones in July, many see this as the start of Ethereum’s next leg up. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Technical and Trade From a charting perspective, Ethereum price prediction seems bullish as it has broken out of an ascending channel since March. Daily RSI is at 72, indicating strong momentum but overbought conditions. No reversal candles yet, bulls are in control. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Ethereum Trade Outlook Entry: $2,864 (pullback zone) Stop-Loss: Below $2,700 (mid channel support) Targets: $3,126 (resistance), then $3,432 (channel top) A bullish engulfing or hammer candle at support would be additional confirmation for dip buyers.

2025-07-12T08:50:07,"Why Pi Network Coin Price is Dropping","The post Why Pi Network Coin Price is Dropping appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network Coin holders are feeling the heat as token price drop by 9% while the entire crypto market enjoys strong gains. While Bitcoin has smashed a new all-time-high, Pi Coin keeps slipping closer to its all-time low $0.40. Many are now wondering why the Pi network coin price is dropping. Pi Network Coin Drops 9% In the past 24 hours alone, Pi Coin has dropped about 9% and now trades near $0.471, not far from its lowest level ever, $0.40. This looks worse when you compare it to the rest of the crypto market, which is all green. Bitcoin is above $118,000 and Ethereum crossed $3,000, but Pi keeps moving the other way. Even the recent Pi2Day celebration, which was supposed to boost excitement in the Pi community, couldn’t lift the price. Over the last two weeks, Pi has fallen more than 29%, showing just how deep this downtrend has become. Token Unlock Adds More Pressure One big reason behind Pi’s continued slide is the massive token unlock happening this July. Between July 8 and July 15, over 100 million PI tokens about 1.5% of the total supply will hit the market. On one day alone, 10.1 million token s will be unlocked. These unlocked tokens often end up being sold by big holders, which adds extra selling pressure when there aren’t enough buyers to balance it out. Many whales are taking profits by selling, and that weighs heavily on the price. Pi Technicals Still Look Weak The technical side isn’t offering much comfort either. Pi Coin is trading inside a clear downward channel. Each time it tries to break higher, sellers push it back down. The trading volume is also low at $19.95 million, which shows that buyers don’t have enough strength to flip the trend just yet. However, Pi Network RSI has also reflected a bearish sentiment as it is currently at 39.8 reflecting an over-sold. What’s Next for Pi Coin? For now, the risks look bigger than the chances of a sudden turnaround. With so many tokens unlocking and big holders ready to sell, Pi could easily slip back to test the $0.40 zone or even drop into the $0.35 or $0.38 range if things get worse. Until Pi sees stronger buying interest, emergency liquidity, or a big exchange listing, the price may stay stuck in this bearish phase.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-pi-network-coin-price-is-dropping/,"TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T08:47:32,"XLM Explodes by 22% Followed by XRP, BTC Price Calms at $118K: Weekend Watch","Bitcoin’s spectacular end to the business week, in which the asset gained over ten grand and skyrocketed to a new all-time high, has finally reached an exhaustion point as the asset has calmed at $118,000. Several altcoins have followed suit, while XRP, CRO, and especially XLM have charted mindblowing gains. BTC’s Rally It’s been a while since we have said this, but a lot can change in the cryptocurrency markets in the span of a few days. Recall that itcoin’s price stood within a tight range between $105,000 and $110,000 for a few weeks, and each breakout attempt in both directions was stopped in its tracks. However, that all came to an end on Wednesday evening when the asset finally broke out of the upper boundary and shot up to a new all-time high of $112,000. After a brief retracement, the cryptocurrency began an even more impressive rally that resulted in tapping $116,000 on Thursday evening, but BTC went all the way up to almost $119,000 on Friday morning. Although it has lost some traction since then and now trades just under $118,000, bitcoin has gained over 9% on a weekly scale. Its market capitalization has grown to $2.345 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has declined slightly to 62.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XLM Steals the Show Most altcoins posted mindblowing gains over the past few days as well, but have calmed since yesterday. Ethereum, for instance, went from $2,500 to over $3,000 to market a five-month peak before it corrected slightly to just under the latter. In contrast, XRP was a little sluggish at first but took the spotlight yesterday by surging to almost $3. Although it has dropped below $2.8 now, it’s still 7% up on the day, and it overtook USDT in terms of market cap. CRO has charted a similar price surge over the past day, taking it to well over $0.1. However, the day belongs to XLM, which has exploded by more than 22% and now trades above $0.37. Pi Network’s native token, on the other hand, has plunged by over 6% and struggles to remain above $0.47. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets gained over $300 billion since Wednesday and stands at $3.750 trillion on CG now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against major currencies, closed at 94.73, just above recent lows and down 10.4% from its 2022 high.

Some want to wait, others see inflation risks that require more tightening. Markets are pricing in a 50% chance of a July rate cut—a coin flip that keeps traders on edge. In crypto, the picture is clearer. ETF hopes are building despite the SEC delaying Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF. Analysts think more crypto ETFs are coming as institutions start to treat Bitcoin like digital gold. This narrative makes BTC a better hedge against rate changes and geopolitical risk. Meanwhile, Peter Schiff is telling everyone to sell Bitcoin for silver and the market is ignoring him. BTC is up 6% after his warning and many are citing institutional inflows and strong technicals as reasons to stay long. Trade Setup and Risks to Watch Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, therefore, for a continuation trade, here’s a setup: Entry: Pullback to $116,950 (0.5 Fib) Stop-Loss: Below $112,500 (0.382) Targets: $121,378 (0.618), $124,682, $127,681 This is a Fibonacci confluence and trend play. Look for reversal signs—spinning top or Doji—at resistance levels. But risks remain. The July 12 Fed minutes could be volatile if the tone turns hawkish. And the US government’s tariff policies—especially towards BRICS countries like South Africa—will impact global risk sentiment and crypto indirectly. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s technical breakout, a weak dollar, and growing ETF hopes mean more upside could be ahead. Whether BTC gets to $300,000 this year is a confluence of events—Fed policy, institutional adoption, and macro volatility. But for now, bulls are in control.

2025-07-12T08:26:06,"Chainlink Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will LINK Price Reach $100?","The post Chainlink Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will LINK Price Reach $100? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of the LINK token is $ 15.37524568 . Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview Chainlink Price Target July 2025 LINK Price Prediction 2025 Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $ 15.37524568 -0.60% Market Cap $ 10,425,953,638.0109 Trading Volume $ 669,601,844.3430 Circulating Supply 678,099,970.4528 All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 Chainlink Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trying to reverse the decline from mid-May caused by a change in geopolitical factors. The end of June onwards LINK showed bullish reawakening in the short term with BTC rallying and its price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $15 mark after witnessing a short-term rally. Based on price action, a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if it breaks below $13, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK’s price began to rise again, but in past 15-days it is attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

Recent data points to large-scale transactions, particularly on the Bitcoin and Ethereum side. A whale with a wallet named bc1q0l, who had withdrawn 2,100 BTC from Binance after holding it for about four months, deposited 1,000 BTC (approximately $117.67 million) back into Binance just an hour ago, marking a profit. The whale had collected the Bitcoins at $84,861, a profit of approximately $68.8 million at current prices. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also experiencing significant activity. A wallet with the address 0x247B, reportedly affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation, sold 1,207 ETH for 3.61 million USDC five hours ago.

On the same day, SharpLink Gaming, which received 10,000 ETH ($25.7 million) directly from the Ethereum Foundation, followed up with an additional 21,487 ETH ($64.26 million) from the over-the-counter (OTC) market and Coinbase Prime. However, not every investor is bullish on the market. The rise in short positions in Ethereum is noteworthy: The wallet with address 0x8c58 deposited 3.74 million USDC in the last hour, shorting 18,394 ETH ($54.3 million) with 15x leverage. 0x2258 deposited 3.25 million USDC and shorted 16,219 ETH ($48 million) with 25x leverage. Another investor with the address 0xec4b opened a short position of 13,845 ETH ($41.07 million) with 15x leverage. Amidst all this trading, institutional activity continues. BlackRock's Ethereum ETF, ETHA, recorded its highest daily net inflow in history yesterday: 106,827 ETH (approximately $320 million). This brings BlackRock's total ETH holdings to over 2 million ETH (approximately $6 billion). *This is not investment advice.

The rally mirrors broader strength across the crypto market, as investors pile into risk assets amid fresh regulatory momentum and a record-breaking run for Bitcoin. The Ripple ( XRP ) token jumped as high as $2.9695 on July 11, its highest level since March 2, driven by three key factors: Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) surge to an all-time high of $118,300, accelerating inflows into the new leveraged XRP exchange traded fund, or ETF, and renewed investor optimism following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s appearance in Washington ahead of the proposed CLARITY Act. Combined with bullish technical signals—including a breakout from a months-long triangle pattern—the rally has traders eyeing a return to the coin’s year-to-date peak of $3.3930. The recently launched Teucrium 2X Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP) continued to attract investors, with its assets increasing to $248 million. It has experienced inflows in every week since its launch in April, and its daily volume has increased significantly. The XRP ETFs seeing surge in volume today, like 4-5x the norm, especially the 2x one $XXRP , which is up 27% today, 55% this week with $120m in volume.. Teucrium rewarded for getting out early.. ht @Todd_Sohn pic.twitter.com/Bk8hsNFhW1 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 11, 2025 The ongoing inflows surge into XXRP is notable because of its costs. Unlike most ETFs, which have an expense ratio of less than 0.50%, the fund’s ratio stands at 1.89%. This means that a $10,000 investment costs about $189.

Additionally, the Average Directional Index has risen to 25, indicating that the trend is strengthening.

2025-07-12T07:54:19,"Google Gemini Sets Bitcoin Price for July 31, 2025","Bitcoin is demonstrating significant strength in July 2025, with market dynamics signaling continued upward movement as the month progresses. Currently priced at $117,430, the asset has gained 5% in the past 24 hours and 9% over the past week, reflecting growing investor confidence. While numerous analysts have offered varied projections, Google’s AI platform Gemini has added its voice to the broader conversation around Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Post-Tariff Rally Begins with “Liberation Day” Much of the current momentum in Bitcoin’s price can be traced back to early April, when a major geopolitical and economic development changed investor behavior. On April 2, President Donald Trump declared what he called “Liberation Day,” a sweeping policy shift involving an aggressive package of tariffs aimed at rebalancing global trade. This announcement initially triggered a downturn in traditional stock markets. However, Bitcoin moved in the opposite direction, climbing from around $70,000 to its present range. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Boosts Institutional Confidence One of the most consequential actions that followed Liberation Day was President Trump’s executive order to establish a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Describing it as a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold, the president outlined the need for a sovereign digital asset buffer in an increasingly uncertain financial world. This historic decision marked the first formal effort by the United States to incorporate Bitcoin into its national reserve strategy, signaling to the global market that the asset was now being viewed through a national security and long-term value lens. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bitcoin’s Supply Structure Reinforces Store-of-Value Status These policy moves have coincided with heightened interest from institutional investors, many of whom now view Bitcoin not only as a hedge against inflation but also as a geopolitical asset. Bitcoin’s unique structure, particularly its limited supply of 21 million coins, has always invited comparisons to gold. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be expanded at will by central banks, Bitcoin’s fixed issuance model ensures scarcity, a quality that becomes attractive in times of economic volatility or strategic financial repositioning. Google Gemini Forecasts Bitcoin to Hit $120,000 by Month-End As market participants adjust to these developments, Google Gemini has analyzed the underlying data and market indicators to offer a short-term forecast. According to its assessment, Bitcoin is expected to reach approximately $120,000 by July 31, 2025, representing a 2.1% increase from current levels. Gemini stated: “Based on current momentum and macroeconomic catalysts, Bitcoin is on track to climb approximately 2.1% to $120,000 by July 31.” This projection is grounded in a synthesis of price trends, supply-demand mechanics, and the broader policy environment. With less than three weeks until the end of the month, market observers are paying close attention to how Bitcoin performs relative to Gemini’s forecast.

2025-07-12T07:40:09,"Are Binance Founder CZ and Donald Trump in an Alliance? Here are the Allegations","Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has been revealed to be providing behind-the-scenes support to a crypto venture owned by the Trump family, according to Bloomberg. This aid comes at a time when Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) is seeking clemency from US President Donald Trump. According to three sources familiar with the matter, Binance wrote the underlying software code for the stablecoin USD1, launched by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial Inc. This technical support includes developing the “smart contract” that governs the creation of USD1. This coin was used in the spring when a United Arab Emirates-based investment firm purchased a $2 billion stake in Binance. More than two months after this major transaction, approximately 90% of USD1 tokens in circulation are still held in Binance wallets, according to on-chain data. The interest income generated by these assets could generate tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue for the Trump family. Binance also introduced USD1 to its 275 million user base, a privilege often coveted by stablecoin issuers. Related News: Grayscale Sends Special Letter to SEC Regarding XRP, Solana, and Cardano ETFs - Here's What It Says So, publicly available data and testimony from people familiar with the situation suggest that Binance was directly involved in the creation, promotion, and largest-ever transaction of USD1. However, it remains unclear whether Binance or Zhao received any payment from the Trump family for this service. Binance's statement said USD1 had gone through the exchange's “standard listing process.” It emphasized that CZ was no longer CEO and that the amnesty application was a “personal decision.” Zhao did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment. A spokesperson for World Liberty declined to elaborate on the relationship with Binance, but said, “Your allegations are baseless and intended to feed a political agenda.” It's unclear how the companies first made contact. However, two sources familiar with the matter claimed that CZ met with Steve Witkoff, a Trump associate and co-founder of World Liberty, at a Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi in December. At the time, Zhao had just been released from federal custody after a short sentence for violating anti-money laundering regulations, while Binance had paid over $4 billion in fines to US authorities. A member of Witkoff's inner circle denied that the meeting took place. Witkoff, previously appointed as a diplomat by Trump, was reportedly in the process of transferring his shares in World Liberty to his sons. White House Counsel David Warrington stated that Witkoff managed this process in accordance with ethical rules. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-12T07:34:55,"Crypto Traders Eye $130K Bitcoin as Majors Price-Action Shows Market Structure Shift","Bitcoin’s rally to $120,000 this week has sparked a broader breakout across major crypto assets, with ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, XRP, and dogecoin (DOGE) all posting high single-digit percentage gains. However, this time, price action isn’t just about momentum, as traders claim that market structure is evolving under the weight of institutional influence. “This isn’t a frenzied boom with no foundation,” said Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank. “It’s a measured ascent, backed up by large institutional players with the long-term in mind.” Rocca pointed to tight monetary policy and geopolitical volatility as reinforcing Bitcoin’s emerging role as a macro hedge, adding that “the momentum we’ve seen over the last 48 hours is clear. Bitcoin isn’t just growing in value, but also as a genuine asset class that is rivalling traditional finance.” Ethereum, up over 17% on the week and briefly crossed $3,000, remains a primary beneficiary. ""In Q2, corporate treasury purchases of BTC outpaced inflows into spot ETFs,"" said the analytics team at Bitcoin yield protocol TeraHash in a note to CoinDesk. ""That points to strategic positioning. At the same time, custodians like Anchorage and Fidelity are scaling institutional pipelines, while OTC desks are tightening spreads."" Solana, now trading around $163, gained over 11% on the week amid renewed demand across retail and memecoin ecosystems. The chain continues to act as a high-beta proxy for risk-on sentiment. XRP, meanwhile, jumped 25%, benefiting from both a technical breakout and rising speculation around regulatory resolution. “Price action may grab the spotlight,” TeraHash added, “but the real breakthrough this summer is structural.” The altcoin move is broad-based. Dogecoin has rallied 23% over the past week, driven by increased retail participation through platforms like Robinhood and Binance. XRP volumes have spiked on Korean exchanges, while Cardano, TRX, and AVAX are all trading firmly in the green. Meanwhile, Bitpanda Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said that “strong bitcoin rallies are often followed by significant movements in altcoins with a slight delay — and a potential comeback of meme coins can’t be ruled out either.” But not everyone sees a straight line up. “Despite briefly touching this key milestone, BTC remains below a major resistance zone,” said Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler, said in an email. “A decisive breakout and sustained move above this level could trigger a sharp upward rally, potentially targeting the $130,000 range,” Lienkha added.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/12/crypto-traders-eye-130k-bitcoin-as-majors-price-action-shows-market-structure-shift,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|DOGE|SOL","Markets|btc|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T07:30:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Climbs But Eyes Are On This DeFi Coin That Could Explode 40x","As Bitcoin (BTC) makes modest gains and reclaims investor attention with its latest price climb, the real buzz is building around a lesser-known but rapidly emerging player in the DeFi ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 65% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $12.1 million has already been raised, with a total of more than 13,100 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on investments made in Phase 5. While BTC’s momentum signals strength in the broader crypto market, analysts and insiders are zeroing in on Mutuum Finance. Bitcoin Reclaims Momentum Amid ETF and Macro Tailwinds Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to roughly $118,016, setting fresh highs in response to substantial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, declining on‑exchange supply, and growing investor optimism around potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts slated for September. Bolstered by upbeat institutional sentiment and regulatory clarity, including a strategic U.S. crypto reserve, the leading digital asset has reclaimed all‑time high territory and is eyeing a move toward the $120,000 level. With on‑chain metrics pointing to record low liquid supply, analysts suggest Bitcoin may continue its ascent into August. Amid this backdrop, sector watchers remain alert to emerging DeFi protocols, such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Reaches $12.1M Milestone in Presale The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13100 investors and has raised more than $12.1 million. Investors have picked up more than 65% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Starts Major Token Giveaway Event Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of $10,000 in MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded under its newly introduced leaderboard system. As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. How Mutuum Finance Is Transforming Lending in DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets. It is a workable multifunctional double-lending system, which incorporates the synergy of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, lending pools are utilized via smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like meme coins. While Bitcoin (BTC) continues its upward momentum, climbing past $118,000 amid ETF inflows and macro tailwinds, the real breakout potential may lie in the DeFi sector, where Mutuum Finance is gaining serious traction. With over $12.1 million raised and more than 13,100 early investors, Mutuum’s Phase 5 presale is already 65% sold out at a price of $0.03, offering investors a 100% ROI at listing. As excitement builds ahead of Phase 6, analysts are projecting a potential 40x upside by year-end, thanks to Mutuum’s innovative dual lending model and fully audited smart contracts.

2025-07-12T07:08:56,"Wall Street Bets Big — $3.6B Pours Into Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs Weekly","The demand for cryptocurrency on Wall Street is more than evident, and the past week only proved that narrative. The ETFs tracking the performance of the two largest digital assets recorded a highly impressive five-day trading period, attracting billions of dollars in total. In the meantime, the prices of both skyrocketed to a multi-month and an all-time high. Bitcoin ETFs See Over $2.5B in Net Inflows Let’s begin with the most impressive numbers, which came in the last two trading days of the week. Data from FarSide shows that Thursday saw the biggest new inflow day since early November and the second-largest in the 18-month history of the funds. $1,175.6 billion went into the financial vehicles, which were distributed somewhat evenly between three of the biggest – $448.5 million into BlackRock’s IBIT, $324.3 million into Fidelity’s FBTC, and $268.7 million into Ark Invest’s ARKB. Friday was almost as impressive, with $1,029.6 billion entering the funds. This time, though, IBIT dwarfed its competition, attracting $953.5 million. ARKB, which was second, was far, far behind, with a modest $23.5 million in net inflows. Adding the $215.7 million witnessed on Wednesday, $80.1 million on Tuesday, and $216.5 million on Monday, the total for the week stands at $2,717.5 billion. Somewhat expected, these mindblowing numbers affected the underlying asset’s price, which surged by over $10,000 to a new all-time high of almost $119,000 on Friday. What’s perhaps even more impressive is that all Bitcoin ETFs have seen only one negative day (July 1) since June 9. ETH ETFs Impress, Too The spot Ethereum ETFs , which are close to celebrating their first year in existence, have also become a lot more favorable among investors in the past few months. Moreover, they set a record in terms of daily inflows on Thursday, as reported , when $383.1 million entered the funds. Friday and Wednesday were also impressive in this regard, albeit in a more modest manner, with $204.9 million and $211.3 million going into the financial vehicles, respectively. On Monday and Tuesday, investors allocated $62.1 million and $46.7 million into the ETFs, bringing the total for the week to $908.1 million, according to data from FarSide. BlackRock’s ETHA has dominated the landscape once again, gaining over $300 million out of the $383.1 million on Thursday and $137.1 million out of the $204.9 million on Friday. ETH’s price has also benefited from the substantial interest in the Ethereum ETFs, shooting up this week from $2,500 on Wednesday to a multi-month high of its own at $3,040 on Friday. It has retraced slightly to just under $3,000 now, but it’s still up by over 17% on a weekly scale. In total, the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs attracted more than $3.6 billion in one week alone.

John Marshall, Goldman’s head of derivatives research, says in a new interview with CNBC that the brokerages Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) are benefiting from a surge in retail trading activity, which could boost their stock prices. “The retail activity – while they may not have been buying intensely over the last couple of months, they’ve been very active, and that should be a tailwind for both of them.” Marshall also says Goldman believes the equipment and machinery giant John Deere (DE) could benefit from the agricultural cycle, which the firm believes is at a cyclical bottom. Goldman Sachs’ other tactical trades related to Q2 earnings reports include the cloud-based data storage firm Snowflake (SNOW), the aircraft leasing company Air Lease Corporation (AL), the restaurant franchise giant YUM! (YUM) and the global branded food company Hormel Foods (HRL). In terms of stocks that could slide in price due to earnings reports, Marshall mentions the furniture giant Restoration Hardware (RH). “While they don’t report until September, that’s a name which has tough compares.” Other stocks that Goldman thinks could have potential downside include the airline giant Southwest (LUV) and the Boston Beer Company (SAM).

Trading volumes surged past 1.1B during the 13:00–15:00 session, establishing resistance between $0.208–$0.213. Support held at $0.200–$0.201 through late-session volatility, with final hour price action stabilizing around $0.202. Analysts flagged the rejection at $0.211 (20:00) as evidence of systematic profit-taking by larger holders. News Background: BTC Record, Risk-On Flows Drive Meme Coin Rally Bitcoin touched an all-time high of $118,000 during the session, as crypto markets benefited from a surge in institutional inflows — estimated at $50B this week alone. Easing geopolitical tensions, improving trade relations, and dovish signals from central banks have boosted risk assets across the board. Dogecoin, typically a high-beta play during crypto rallies, surged alongside altcoins in response. Price Action Summary Range: $0.198 → $0.213 → $0.202 | Total swing: 8.6% Breakout Zone: $0.200–$0.208 cleared on strong volume Resistance: $0.208–$0.213, with reversal from $0.211 Support: $0.200–$0.201 tested and held multiple times Final Hour (04:55–05:54): Price rose from $0.200 → $0.202 (+0.5%) Volume Peak: 1.1B between 13:00–15:00; 19M during 05:00–05:10 late surge Technical Analysis Mid-session momentum broke above key resistance zones but failed to sustain above $0.213 Volume-backed reversal near session high suggests strategic exits by institutions Final-hour recovery shows $0.200 remains psychologically significant Momentum cooling; near-term consolidation expected in $0.200–$0.204 band What Traders Are Watching Can DOGE reclaim and hold above $0.208–$0.210 to retest highs? Breakdown below $0.198–$0.200 would signal trend exhaustion Consolidation above $0.202 would support a bullish continuation setup into next week Broader BTC and macro risk sentiment will continue to dictate altcoin flows Takeaway DOGE followed broader crypto markets higher with a clean intraday breakout — but its rejection at $0.213 and sharp pullback highlight the fragile nature of meme coin rallies during high volatility sessions. Institutional flows remain, but traders should watch for volume confirmation before chasing upside. $0.200 is now the line in the sand.

2025-07-12T06:48:24,"Expert Explains Why XRP Is More Powerful Than Direct Connections","An intriguing post by financial expert Jake Claver has offered a fresh take on XRP’s core utility. Claver emphasized that “XRP doesn’t compete in many currency pair battles. Instead, it pools all liquidity into one central point.” This framing highlights a design where XRP acts as a unified bridge asset rather than a token tied to individual trading pairs. XRP doesn’t compete in many currency pair battles. Instead, it pools all liquidity into one central point. This makes XRP much more powerful than any single direct connection. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) July 10, 2025 Claver’s comment draws attention to XRP’s structural advantage in liquidity sourcing. Meanwhile, Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, had detailed how the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) auto‑bridge feature ensures XRP acts as a central intermediary , optimizing transactions between tokens and reinforcing its liquidity role on the ledger. This mechanism supports growing volumes of tokenized assets, translating into higher XRP usage for both fees and liquidity provision. XRP’s Growing Adoption and Infrastructure Over the longer horizon, the structural liquidity model Claver describes supports broader industry trends. Ripple has seen rapid adoption of its XRP-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product and a notable increase in partnerships, currently working with hundreds of financial institutions. The ODL system uses XRP to settle cross‑border transfers without requiring banks to maintain pre-funded accounts, and this innovation reduces cost and latency in global payments, making XRP a preferred option for cross-border payments. Additionally, XRP’s role is not sidelined by new stablecoin products like RLUSD. While one commenter expressed this concern, Schwartz has previously clarified that RLUSD enhances XRP’s function by introducing alternative settlement paths without reducing XRP’s bridging utility. Higher volumes of tokenized assets on XRPL also help the ecosystem, as it leads to escalating demand for XRP for transaction fees and liquidity. This dynamic affirms XRP as integral to the ledger’s long-term economic model. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX), automated market maker (AMM), and other features gain traction, the digital asset’s central role in enabling liquidity becomes more pronounced. Reactions Reflect Widespread Confidence Multiple community members responded enthusiastically to Claver’s post. Many echoed his assessment by highlighting XRP’s real‑world utility, contrasting it with assets that lack tangible use cases. One commenter shared excitement about XRP’s potential to outperform Bitcoin in practical applications, and another suggested that the asset could reach triple-digit targets by the end of the year. Others reaffirmed that Claver’s liquidity framing is consistent with XRP’s design and mission. XRP enjoys structural strengths often overlooked in speculative discourse, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has reaffirmed the importance of liquidity, predicting that it could capture 14% of SWIFT’s volume within 5 years by prioritizing liquidity provisioning.

2025-07-12T06:45:01,"Bitcoin Dumped for Ethereum: Bit Digital Bets $172M on ETH. Is This the End of Bitcoin Dominance?","A major shift in the crypto world has occurred. Bit Digital has made a massive $172 million move, favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin. This bold bet raises questions about the future of Bitcoin's leading position. What does this mean for the supremacy of cryptocurrencies? Could this signal a new era for other digital coins? The answers may surprise. Analysis powered by Outset PR , a blockchain PR agency that leverages data, trends, and market timing to empower Web3 leaders to maximize every opportunity. Bitcoin Price Flirts with New Highs: Bullish Momentum Builds Source: tradingview Bitcoin is showing strong movement, with prices hovering slightly above $107,000 to $111,000. It is just under a key resistance point at nearly $114,000. If Bitcoin breaks past this, it could aim for around $119,000, a potential jump of about 7%. With a six-month growth of almost 19%, Bitcoin’s upward momentum appears solid. Indicators like the RSI suggest high interest from buyers. The current pattern suggests further gains if Bitcoin maintains its pace and crosses resistance levels. Enthusiasts are hopeful even as cautious optimism prevails, as Bitcoin continues its climb, setting sights on breaking new records. Ethereum Surges: Can ETH Break Past $3000 Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price currently sits between $2420 and $2679, showing a positive trend with a 9.10% increase over the past week. Analysts highlight the nearest resistance level at $2787, which ETH might test soon. If it breaks through, the next target is $3047, promising a potential rise of about 14% from the current range. With the relative strength index near 68, ETH indicates strong momentum but is not overbought just yet. This suggests room for further growth. However, caution is advised as the nearest support at around $2269 could slow things down.

Here are some of the possible reasons behind this impressive price surge that drove XRP to almost $3. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Social Engagements and Network Activity CryptoPotato reported yesterday the notable price move north, which drove XRP from roughly $2.3 to just shy of $3 within a 36-to 48-hour period. Although it failed to go beyond $3 to challenge its January 2018 all-time high and has retraced slightly, the price surge helped XRP overtake USDT in terms of market cap. Some analysts predicted this development, ever warning that most traders would miss it. Santiment also weighed in on the matter, outlining its reasons behind the massive surge. The analytics company noted that this breakout transpired in times when the network behind the token saw an impressive growth, which is seen by the rising number of newly created wallets. More precisely, nearly 7,000 such new addresses were created within 24 hours. XRP has pumped to a high of $2.97 today, breaking out to a 4-month high. This is coinciding with a major increase in network growth (new wallets created) & rise in retail interest across social media. Track these metrics any time on this chart: https://t.co/pk1BSHPO8G pic.twitter.com/AD8sUSUfu6 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 11, 2025 Santiment’s second reason is related to the overall retail interest in the token across social media, where 5.5% of all crypto discussions centered around XRP. This was the highest level since mid-March when Ripple’s CEO announced the end of the prolonged legal battle between the company and the US SEC. Whales and Market Resurgence As XRP was just beginning its breakout, CryptoPotato reported another probable reason that could have driven the asset higher. At the time, the number of large wallets holding at least a million tokens had risen to an all-time high of 2,743 (and 2,742 on the next day). The last reason we will discuss in this article is the overall market resurgence. XRP was not the only cryptocurrency in a consolidation phase for weeks. Bitcoin, the market leader, was in a similar state despite some volatility experienced during the Israel-Iran war. However, it broke out on Wednesday evening and led the entire market into the promised land . After surging to a new all-time high of almost $119,000 on Friday, many altcoins followed suit, including XRP. Being the first, biggest, and arguably most important digital asset, BTC’s moves effect significantly the rest of the market.

2025-07-12T06:34:52,"Athur Hayes Predicts Ethereum’s Surge To $10,000 As ETH Soars Past $3,000","Ethereum (ETH) performed strongly this week, surging to a high of over $3000. Its rise comes as Bitcoin also hits its all-time high of $118,000 , which is a sign that the crypto market is gaining strong momentum with time. Notably, ETH has climbed back above the $3,000 mark for the first time since February, marking a strong recovery after a drop from $4,100 in December 2025 to a low of $1,387 in April. This rebound comes at a time when global markets remain unsettled by renewed tariff disputes and growing political uncertainty tied to former President Trump’s influence on economic policy. That said, Ethereum’s surge in price has raised various optimistic observations and predictions from analysts. In a post, Pentoshi, a popular crypto analyst, highlighted the shifting sentiment around Ethereum, noting that growing capital inflows, especially from public companies, could soon outweigh all ETH issued since the Merge. With Ethereum’s market cap still a fraction of Bitcoin’s, the analyst suggested it won’t take much to trigger significant price moves. He urged the community to put aside bias and recognize the momentum building behind ETH, calling its rise “inevitable” in hindsight. Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of the BitMEX platform, predicted that ETH would hit $10,000 following the ongoing surge. ‘‘ Arise Chikun, it’s time… ETH = $10,000 Yachtzee,’’ Arthur tweeted on Thursday, sharing the chart below Hayes further pointed out that Ethereum is steadily gaining ground against Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC trading pair slowly climbing from its historical lows. Elsewhere, market analyst XForceGlobal recently echoed similar views, predicting that Ethereum as an asset is on track to eventually reach the $10,000 milestone. He emphasized that growing institutional interest, improving fundamentals, and Ethereum’s evolving role in the blockchain ecosystem all support a long-term bullish outlook. “The move up on the shorter timeframes was objectively. ETH is still looking to shoot for a new ATH’s this cycle and should end around $9,000- $10,000, give or take.” XForceGlobal tweeted. No macro scenario is providing a ‘good look’ and remains only ideal in nature using context; however, this remains as my primary idea for now, ‘ Meanwhile, analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted that Ethereum is approaching a critical resistance level around $3,500, with a potential breakout on the horizon if bullish momentum persists. He pointed to the growing impact of Ethereum ETFs that include staking features as a possible catalyst, emphasizing that these products could significantly reduce the circulating supply. The further pundit suggested that recent regulatory shifts, such as the SEC’s more favorable stance toward proof-of-stake assets, combined with staking demand, may create the ideal conditions for Ethereum to break past this key barrier. At press time, ETH is trading at $2,981.30, reflecting a 5.28% surge within the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/athur-hayes-predicts-ethereums-surge-to-10000-as-eth-soars-past-3000/,"ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION","Ethereum|Markets|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T06:25:39,"Why is XRP Price Up Today?","The post Why is XRP Price Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price has surged 26% this week, reaching $2.80, driven by a combination of powerful market catalysts. On-chain data reveals that whales now hold over 47 billion XRP, signaling strong institutional confidence. This accumulation, paired with a major short squeeze that liquidated millions in bearish bets, has intensified upward pressure. Additionally, growing speculation around a potential XRP spot ETF has fueled investor excitement, pushing the token closer to a breakout above $3 . What is Driving XRP Price Surge Today? Whale Accumulation Reaches New Peaks According to on-chain data from Santiment , the number of wallets holding over 1 million XRP has reached a record 2,743. These whales now control a combined 47.3 billion XRP. Santiment calls this trend a very positive sign for the fourth-largest crypto asset, reflecting deeper conviction among top-tier holders. Short Squeeze Pushes Price Higher As XRP pushed higher, nearly $31.4 million in short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours alone. With bears getting squeezed out, momentum accelerated. The coin’s open interest now stands at $7.2 billion, its highest in six months and inching closer to the January peak of $8.3 billion. That’s more than double the $3 billion low seen in April, according to CoinGlass . Altcoin Season Heats Up This XRP breakout mirrors broader market excitement. Bitcoin recently smashed records, topping $116,500, while Ethereum gained 17.5 percent on the week, trading near $2,960. Santiment confirms the altcoin season is underway, with traders rotating profits from Bitcoin into major altcoins like XRP. I mentioned that $2.70-$2.90 was the zone to watch out for. So now that $XRP had touched $2.97 and rejected off the 0.786 fib at $2.90, we should stall out for a while, retest the lower support levels before we finally send higher. Exciting times ahead! https://t.co/pydkpn86UI pic.twitter.com/w6XadTDDUk — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 12, 2025 XRP has gained nearly 7% over the past 30 days, steadily building strength since mid-June. It now ranks as the second-best performer this week after Ether. Recently, XRP surpassed a $170 billion market cap. Analysts believe that if XRP clears the $2.90 barrier, a move to $3 is likely. Despite its rally, XRP still trades 18% below its 2018 all-time high, which it nearly reclaimed in January. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Net Worth Climbs to $10B After SEC Settlement , Short and Long-Term Outlook In the near term, if momentum continues and XRP holds above $2.60–$2.65, analysts see $3 as an achievable target by August. Long term, a successful XRP ETF approval combined with sustained whale activity could push the token to $3.50–$4 by Q4 2025. With RSI near 66, technicals still leave room for upside. ETF Buzz Adds Fuel The SEC has fast-tracked ETF reviews, cutting wait times to just 75 days. Futures-based XRP ETFs are expected between July 14 and 25, but the real catalyst would be a spot ETF approval. If that happens, it could change everything for XRP’s future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As of July 12, 2025, XRP is trading around $2.80, up over 8% in the last 24 hours. It has seen a 26% surge this week, reaching its highest levels since late May. Will XRP reach its all-time high this month? XRP’s all-time high is $3.40 (from January 2018). While it has shown strong momentum, some analysts predict it could reach $3.00 by August. A quick move to ATH in July is possible but depends on sustained bullish catalysts. How high can XRP’s price go in 2025? Analysts project XRP could reach $3.50-$4 by Q4 2025, especially with a spot ETF approval. Some more bullish forecasts even suggest $5-$8 by year-end, driven by increased adoption and regulatory clarity.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-xrp-price-up-today/,"XRP|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T06:21:30,"Analyst Says XRP Season Starts Now. Here’s why","XRP has recently moved above a critical resistance level against Bitcoin (BTC), a development that is now drawing serious attention among crypto traders. On the 4-hour timeframe, crypto analyst Alex Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) showed that XRP/BTC closed a strong candle above the longstanding horizontal resistance, marking what appears to be a confirmed breakout after weeks of coiling underneath the threshold. The resistance line had repeatedly rejected price advances, capping XRP’s relative strength against Bitcoin throughout multiple tests. But in the latest price action, the digital asset finally pushed through with consecutive closes above the level, supported by moderate volume. The clean structure and horizontal alignment of the breakout reinforce the technical significance of the move, especially within the context of a larger consolidation range that began forming months ago. Yep I’ve seen enough, XRP season starts now pic.twitter.com/zADad3OaIh — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) July 9, 2025 Cobb Declares XRP Season Cobb responded to the breakout with a confident statement: “Yep I’ve seen enough, XRP season starts now.” While brief, Cobb’s declaration speaks directly to the massive breakout that many traders have been anticipating . Cobb expects XRP to demonstrate relative strength across markets, turning the asset’s trajectory fully positive and possibly signaling renewed investor interest. His observation does not stem from speculation alone. Resistance has become support, and the asset is about to enter bullish territory . What to Expect From XRP This breakout changes the dynamics of the XRP/BTC chart significantly. The prolonged period of sideways movement beneath resistance, followed by this decisive move, introduces a shift in structure that favors continuation to the upside. The price behavior suggests that accumulation has been underway, as the trajectory of the asset over the past few months resembles a rounding bottom formation with multiple retests of the resistance level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The absence of immediate rejection after the recent breakout further supports the thesis that the breakout is legitimate. With BTC’s dominance still relatively high, any sustained upward move by XRP in this pair indicates resilience and relative strength, two factors traders look for when assessing whether an altcoin could lead in upcoming market phases. The asset’s rise could also weaken Bitcoin’s dominance , paving the way for a new altcoin season and a potential all-time high for XRP. From a technical perspective, if the breakout holds and XRP confirms support on a retest, the next logical focus will be on measuring potential targets based on the prior range’s height. While short-term volatility remains possible, the structure now leans bullish, especially if volume increases or if additional altcoin-BTC pairs begin exhibiting similar patterns.

2025-07-12T06:17:28,"Can I Sell My BlockDAG? Bitcoin Solaris Offers Liquid Alternative with Confirmed LBank Exchange Listing","The post Can I Sell My BlockDAG? Bitcoin Solaris Offers Liquid Alternative with Confirmed LBank Exchange Listing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A quiet question has been circulating across Telegram and X: “When can I sell my BlockDAG?” For early supporters, the wait continues as listing timelines remain unclear and secondary liquidity hasn’t fully materialized. While the project still holds promise, some investors are beginning to wonder when theory will turn into traction. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is already showing signs of momentum. With visible liquidity, transparent updates, and a focus on accessibility and performance, it’s capturing the attention of those seeking both innovation and immediate value. BlockDAG: Good Concept, Bad Timing? To be clear, BlockDAG is far from a scam. Its directed acyclic graph architecture has genuine technical merit. The promise of scalable parallel transactions has been around for years, and if implemented correctly, it could work beautifully. But the delays are beginning to overshadow the promise. Many are finding themselves stuck, unable to cash out or even transfer tokens. And in a market where speed equals confidence, stalling is fatal. Bitcoin Solaris Hits LBank and Unlocks Access On the flip side, Bitcoin Solaris is making moves fast. It has already secured a confirmed listing on LBank, which offers immediate peace of mind to investors who want real liquidity from day one. This isn’t speculative. It’s live. Listings like this mean more than just hype. They open the door to: Centralized trading pairs Broader market visibility Price discovery from launch day Safer, smoother user onboarding That kind of infrastructure doesn’t just support users. It empowers them. Why Everyone’s Watching BTC-S Now One of the best breakdowns recently came from Crypto Vlog , which highlighted the project’s upcoming features and why the LBank listing is already positioning BTC-S as a more “sellable” and usable coin than competitors still figuring out their next testnet. It’s not just influencers. Over 14,150 investors have already joined the Bitcoin Solaris presale. That’s a level of traction that demands attention. The Presale That’s Actually Delivering We are in Phase 11 of the BTC-S presale , and it’s racing toward one of the fastest closes in recent memory: Current Price: $11 Launch Price: $20 Potential Gain: 150% More importantly, Bitcoin Solaris has just introduced a Price Rollback, a temporary drop to $5 for a limited time. This isn’t a gimmick or a bonus. It’s a rare opportunity to enter at early-bird prices right before launch. And just to keep it smooth: wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for receiving tokens post-launch. No need to connect or transact through them during the presale. Deep Tech, Real Use So what makes Bitcoin Solaris more than just a name? Dual-consensus model (PoW + DPoS) balances security with lightning-fast performance Up to 10,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer Validator rotation improves decentralization and reduces attack vectors Smart contract execution via Rust for enterprise and DeFi scalability Built-in interoperability for cross-chain assets Mobile-first mining through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App Energy-efficient framework that uses 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin You can even calculate projected mining yield with their live calculator . It’s the kind of transparency and access that BlockDAG holders are still waiting on. Tokenomics That Actually Make Sense BTC-S isn’t just about the now; it’s designed for decades of sustainable use: 66.66% for mining over 90 years 20% for presale 5% for liquidity 2% for development (including Helios DeFi layer) 2% for community rewards 2% for marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This model ensures that 98% of tokens flow to users, miners, and the ecosystem, with zero central hoarding. The Better Exit Plan Can you sell your BlockDAG? Possibly. The potential is there, but timelines remain fluid and clarity is still developing. That’s not unusual for emerging tech, and many still believe in its long-term vision. At the same time, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is moving at a different pace. Exchange listings are already secured, transactions are flowing, and its dual-layer architecture is live and gaining traction. It’s a contrast in timing. While some projects are still preparing, BTC-S is already putting plans into action.

2025-07-12T06:15:47,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Attention as Ethereum Slows and Meme Coins Rise Again","This year’s market rhythm feels familiar: a blue-chip heavyweight slows while smaller, nimbler tokens sprint past. Ethereum’s once-reliable climb has flattened, and a new batch of meme coin favorites is picking up the slack. The name traders keep repeating in chat rooms and threads is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically charged, zero-tax coin that seems to fit 2025’s appetite for narrative and utility in equal measure. Inside MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Traders Are Talking MAGACOIN holders have similar reasons for what has attracted them to the project. Its tax-free transfer ensures gains aren’t nibbled away by a fee each time tokens move wallets, and a security stamp from clearing a HashEx audit already puts it ahead of several meme plays. The project also boasts a straightforward governance model as there are no venture-capital allocations, and every big decision heads to a community vote. Wrapping its tokenomics in a tongue-in-cheek political theme ensures a strong narrative that can keep memes flowing and holders engaged long after the initial pump fades. Numbers back the buzz. Early funding rounds pulled in more than ten million dollars, and on-chain data shows steady wallet growth as word spreads in Telegram channels. Supply is capped at 170 billion tokens, a decision to avoid the endless float that weighs on older meme giants. These features have analysts calling the project a “hybrid narrative token,” one with real mechanics beneath the memes. Ethereum Hits the Brakes Ethereum is still the backbone of decentralized finance, yet its price chart tells a quieter story this year. It sits roughly a quarter below its spring peak, held back by declining activity, and other Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks offer more efficient transaction layers. Even the long-awaited ETF approvals failed to light the usual fire under the market. The lull hasn’t dented Ethereum’s long-term thesis, but it leaves momentum-hungry traders searching elsewhere in the short term. Meme Tokens Find Their Spark Whenever Bitcoin inches toward fresh highs—as it has lately—speculative capital trickles down the ladder, and meme coins often catch the overflow. Dogecoin has posted solid weekly jumps, Shiba Inu isn’t far behind, and newcomers like FARTCOIN and PENGU are making headlines. Yet many of these rallies still hinge on nostalgia or sheer volatility. MAGACOIN offers an extra layer with a story that taps into political theater while keeping token holders in charge of the script. That blend of culture and control draws a crowd that once would have parked money solely in Ethereum or XRP. Final Thoughts Markets thrive on rotation. As Ethereum pauses to catch its breath and meme coins ride a fresh gust of speculative wind, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks well placed to benefit. Its fee-free design, audited code, and community-owned roadmap give it substance, while the political-meme angle supplies the spark. Whether it becomes 2025’s defining breakout remains to be seen, but the ingredients—clear narrative, active holders, and real utility—are already in the pot.

2025-07-12T06:12:48,"Why Is Story (IP) Crypto Rising Today? Key Reasons Behind the Surge","The post Why Is Story (IP) Crypto Rising Today? Key Reasons Behind the Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story (IP) crypto has captured market attention with a sharp price surge, fueled by a breakout from a prolonged consolidation phase. The sudden momentum shift reflects growing market interest, supported by a rise in trading volume and strategic accumulation by larger holders. As Story escapes its previous range, traders are eyeing higher targets amid renewed optimism. This upward move highlights a technically driven rally, suggesting that the asset may be entering a new phase of bullish continuation in the near term. Before analyzing the future projections, let’s see why the Story (IP) price is rising. Bitcoin smashed a new ATH during the past trading day, which has filled the entire crypto market with bullish momentum. The Story price rose above the accumulation zone that it had been stuck at for over a month. Story experienced a massive influx of liquidity of over $148 million, as per some reports, which is speculated to be huge whale activity. A breakout from a technical pattern where the IP price remained accumulated for a long time Despite the current breakout, the IP price failed to secure above a crucial resistance range. Does this suggest the Bulls’ strength was limited, and will this drag the IP price below $4? The latest price breakout led the IP price breakout from the descending parallel channel but failed to surpass the pivotal resistance zone between $4.97 and $5.15. However, this cannot be considered a rejection, as the technicians remain within the bullish frame. The price has surpassed the Gaussian channel, which was bearish and hence a daily close above the range may flip the indicator to bullish. On the other hand, the RSI failed to enter the overbought zone but remains stuck along the upper threshold. The overall sentiment is currently very bullish, wherein the on-chain indicators and technical analysis suggest it has outperformed many altcoins recently. On the other hand, rising whale activity and large trade volumes point to accumulation by major holders. Meanwhile, the volatility remains high, as a rapid squeeze up can be followed by a sharp pullback or correction. Besides, some models expect a decline towards $3.6 by mid-August if buying momentum waves. Wrapping it Up!! Story (IP) is rallying today due to a combination of a broader crypto rally led by Bitcoin and very high trading volume, including potential whale activity and technical breakout patterns. That said, some technical forecasts warn of possible short-term retracements before further upside. For now, the Story (IP) price is maintaining a strong ascending trend with strong bullish momentum and hence is above $5 and will eventually reach $5.5 in the near term.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-story-ip-crypto-rising-today-key-reasons-behind-the-surge/,"TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
