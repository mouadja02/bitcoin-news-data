2025-07-12T11:56:13,"Financial Expert Sends Critical Warning to XRP Holders Amid Major Rally","As XRP continues to surge in value, private banker and financial strategist Sidney M Brewer has issued an impassioned warning to the XRP community: do not sell. In a video shared on X, Brewer emphasized that XRP is not merely a digital asset; it is the foundation of a coming financial revolution. His message comes as XRP trades at $2.84, having gained over 30% in the past 10 days, outperforming much of the altcoin market and even outpacing Bitcoin’s recent growth. With Bitcoin currently at $118,500.16, investor attention is once again shifting toward Ripple’s ecosystem. XRP’s Role in the New Financial System According to Brewer, the global financial structure is on the brink of transformation, with XRP playing a pivotal role in this shift. He argues that the legacy financial system, built on fiat currency and central bank control, is being phased out in favor of a tokenized, blockchain-driven future. XRP- Holders listen very carefully! This is bigger than you! DO NOT SELL! pic.twitter.com/IQpntaVfry — Sidney M Brewer (@SidneyMBrewer) July 11, 2025 “Cash is not king,” Brewer asserted. “Your promissory notes aren’t worth the paper or plastic they’re printed on. What’s coming down the pipeline is XRP.” Brewer claims his network of private banking institutions across Canada and the U.S. has spent the last two years preparing for this shift, establishing Special Purpose Corporations (SPCs) and private loan trust companies. Their goal is to create a parallel financial system that enables interest-free loans, replaces debt-based financing, and allows for the tokenization of assets on the blockchain. Why Selling XRP Could Be a Critical Mistake Brewer’s central message is a clear and urgent warning: under no circumstances should holders sell their XRP . He argues that doing so not only weakens the position of the XRP community but also hands control of the asset back to the very financial powers that have perpetuated global debt systems. “There are two sides to this game,” he explained. “On one side are the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and traditional central banks. On the other hand, our side is building a system to empower people. If you sell your XRP, you’re giving them control.” He urged every XRP holder to store a minimum of 10,000 XRP units in cold storage, insisting that those who do will be “grandfathered” into a new private trust system that allows for strategic leveraging of XRP without selling it. Brewer believes XRP should be used as collateral to access liquidity, rather than being cashed out for short-term gains. Education, Tokenization, and Long-Term Wealth Brewer highlighted the importance of education in this new economic era. He criticized retail investors for chasing profits without understanding the long-term implications of their actions. “They’ll think they’re rich, buy houses and cars, then get slammed with taxes and regret,” he said. “They don’t know how to play the game.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Brewer advocates for asset tokenization, where homes, businesses, and other assets are converted into digital tokens as a means to preserve and grow wealth. This approach would allow individuals to access value without selling assets, thereby avoiding traditional finance’s debt traps. A Warning for the Impatient As XRP approaches the critical $3.00 resistance level, Brewer warned that many will panic sell during short-term price spikes, only to lose out on the full potential of what’s to come. “You’re going to panic when it jumps a couple of bucks,” he said. “ But if you sell now, you’ll miss the transfer of wealth that’s coming, and your children will pay the price. ” With thousands of new millionaires expected to emerge in the coming weeks, Brewer’s final advice is resolute: “Even if you get a letter from God signed by Jesus and approved by Moses, do not sell. Hold your XRP outside the system. We got this.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-12T11:51:31,"Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 12 July, 2025","The post Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 12 July, 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s been a packed week in crypto. Ripple grabbed headlines again, Ethereum got a corporate boost, and the Fed may be facing a shake-up of its own. It’s a mix of regulation, big money, and even bigger signals about where the market could be headed. Here are the top stories you need to know. #1 Fed Chair Jerome Powell May Resign Jerome Powell may be preparing to step down as Chair of the Federal Reserve. Fannie Mae Chairman William Pulte said he’s “encouraged by reports” of Powell’s possible resignation, adding it would help the economy “boom.” The pressure has been building. President Trump has sharply criticised Powell’s refusal to cut rates, calling it a costly mistake, and saying he is “terrible”. Powell also faces accusations of misleading Congress over a $2.5 billion Fed renovation. Lawmakers are now calling for a formal investigation. A decision could impact both markets and crypto flows. #2 Justin Sun Commits $100M to Trump Memecoin Justin Sun plans to buy $100 million worth of Donald Trump’s memecoin, just days before a $474 million token unlock. The Tron founder made the announcement on X, calling it a step to “grow the crypto landscape with communities such as GetTrumpMemes.” The move comes as the token prepares to launch on the Tron blockchain. Sun’s history with Trump-linked projects runs deep – including over $90 million spent across earlier ventures. It’s still unclear whether the funds will come from him directly or through the Tron DAO. We are committed to buying $100M of $TRUMP ! Together, $TRUMP and #TRON are the future of Crypto. This move highlights our belief in collaborating across ecosystems to grow the crypto landscape with communities such as @GetTrumpMemes . $TRUMP on #TRON is the currency of #MAGA !… — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) July 9, 2025 #3 Ripple CEO Becomes One of Crypto’s Wealthiest Leaders Brad Garlinghouse is now among crypto’s richest figures, with an estimated net worth of $10 billion. The Ripple CEO’s equity and XRP holdings saw a sharp boost following Ripple’s partial legal win against the U.S. SEC. The company settled for $50 million – far less than the original demand. Garlinghouse, who has led Ripple since 2016, continues to push for crypto-friendly regulations and stronger global partnerships. #4 Musk Names Bitcoin in America Party Agenda Bitcoin gained fresh momentum after Elon Musk confirmed it will be part of his new America Party’s official platform. “Fiat is hopeless so yes,” he said when asked about supporting BTC, a remark that quickly pushed Bitcoin close to $110,000. Dogecoin also jumped 6%. The move follows Musk’s split from the Republican Party over Trump’s controversial $3.3 trillion tax bill. With Tesla still holding over 11,500 BTC, Musk’s stance adds new political weight to Bitcoin’s future in the U.S. #5 Japan’s Metaplanet to Use Bitcoin for Business Acquisitions Japan’s Metaplanet is entering the next phase of its Bitcoin strategy. After adding 2,205 BTC this week, the Tokyo-based company now holds 15,555 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder outside North America. Metaplanet will now use its Bitcoin holdings as collateral to finance acquisitions of profitable businesses. “We need to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can… to reach escape velocity,” said CEO Simon Gerovich. The company has set a bold target: 210,000 BTC by 2027. #6 WazirX, Binance Face Heat as FIU Flags Terror Finance Concerns India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is investigating Binance and WazirX over concerns that crypto transfers may be linked to cross-border terror financing. The focus is on unhosted wallets possibly connected to Pakistan, with increased activity flagged in sensitive regions like Jammu & Kashmir. Binance is cooperating with authorities, a year after settling a ₹18 crore penalty to resume operations in India. WazirX is also under scrutiny, with an upcoming Singapore court hearing and claims that TRX tokens may have been used to fund ISIS-linked activity. #7 Ripple Picks Top U.S. Bank to Strengthen RLUSD Trust Ripple has partnered with BNY Mellon to custody reserves for its stablecoin, RLUSD – a move that boosts regulatory credibility and institutional trust. The announcement came as RLUSD crosses a $500 million market cap just seven months after launch. BNY Mellon will handle reserve assets like cash and U.S. Treasuries. “We are thrilled to support the growth and adoption of RLUSD,” said BNY Mellon’s Emily Portney. Ripple is also pursuing a U.S. banking charter and Fed master account. #8 Nasdaq Firm Goes All-In on Ethereum, Dumps BTC Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-listed firm, has sold off all 280 of its Bitcoin to build a massive Ethereum treasury. After raising $172 million in a public offering, the company now holds over 100,600 ETH, aiming to become the largest corporate holder of Ether. CEO Sam Tabar said the move reflects Ethereum’s long-term value, citing smart contracts and staking rewards. Bit Digital’s stock jumped nearly 18%, as markets responded to the strategy. #9 TON’s Viral Golden Visa Pitch Got Denied by UAE Toncoin surged nearly 12% after TON Foundation’s CEO claimed that staking $100,000 worth of the token could get investors a UAE Golden Visa. But UAE authorities quickly denied it. The country’s top regulators – ICP, SCA, and VARA – issued a joint statement calling the claim false, clarifying that TON is not licensed or approved in Dubai. No such visa route exists for crypto investors. #10 Tokenized Securities Still Count as Securities, Says SEC SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” has warned that tokenizing assets doesn’t change their legal status. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” she said. Her comments come amid rising interest in blockchain-based stocks, with firms like Coinbase seeking approval to offer tokenized equities. Peirce also flagged risks tied to third-party tokens, saying buyers could face added legal and financial uncertainty. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! South Korea to Grant Crypto Startups Venture Status: A new government proposal could give digital asset firms access to tax breaks, funding, and loan guarantees for the first time under the national venture ecosystem. New Zealand Bans Crypto ATMs in Money Laundering Crackdown: Authorities halt 220+ crypto kiosks and limit overseas transfers to $5,000, aiming to tighten controls on illicit fund flows and boost financial crime enforcement. Trump Media Files for ‘Crypto Blue Chip ETF’ with SEC : The proposed fund would track five major tokens including Solana and XRP, with Crypto.com set to serve as digital custodian if approved. Hong Kong’s Stablecoin License Race Draws 40+ Global Players: Top firms like JD.com, Ant Group, and Circle are competing for fewer than 10 stablecoin licenses as Hong Kong rolls out its new digital asset regime this August. Tether CEO Says “We Will Be the Largest Bitcoin Miner by End of 2025”: The USDT issuer is expanding fast with 15+ sites across Latin America, betting big on mining to protect its reserves and meet stricter stablecoin rules under the GENIUS Act. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead Bitcoin could see fresh institutional flows as political endorsements stack up, from Musk’s America Party platform to Japan’s Metaplanet doubling down on BTC-backed acquisitions. Ripple’s stablecoin ambitions may accelerate now that BNY Mellon is on board. With a $500M cap hit and U.S. bank charter in progress, RLUSD could push deeper into regulated finance. Ethereum’s corporate appeal is gaining ground, as Bit Digital ditches BTC for ETH to bet on staking and smart contracts. Tokenization efforts may face more resistance after SEC’s Hester Peirce reaffirmed that digital wrappers don’t dodge securities laws. Platforms like Coinbase will need sharper legal strategies. Memecoins may blur lines between community hype and political narrative, as Justin Sun’s $100M pledge to Trump’s token raises new questions. Stablecoin compliance will tighten globally with new acts coming into play That’s it from me this week.

Is it same like Crypto Purpose? 8 Key Uses Explained Beyond Investment For many, the term “crypto” immediately brings to mind images of volatile charts and high-risk investments. While its role as an investment vehicle is significant, the true crypto purpose extends far beyond speculation. Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary technology with a multifaceted mission to reshape finance, enhance privacy, and provide access to a global digital economy. This article delves into the core functions of cryptocurrency, moving past the hype to explore its fundamental uses. From acting as a new form of money to empowering the unbanked, we will unpack the eight key purposes of crypto and also address the critical risks that every user must understand. Table of Contents What is Cryptocurrency? A Quick Refresher The Core Crypto Purpose: 8 Key Functions Unpacked Navigating the Risks: The Critical Considerations of Crypto Conclusion: A Technology of Potential and Prudence Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is Cryptocurrency? A Quick Refresher Before diving into its purpose, let’s clarify what “crypto” is. Short for cryptocurrency, it’s a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (like the U.S. Dollar or the Indian Rupee), crypto operates on a decentralized system called a blockchain. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, was the first, but thousands of others, known as “altcoins,” have since been created. Each has unique features, but they all share the foundational principle of operating independently from a central bank or single authority. The Core Crypto Purpose ( crypto pur ): 8 Key Functions Unpacked Understanding the true crypto purpose requires looking at its diverse applications. Here are eight of its most important functions: 1. A Modern Medium of Exchange At its most basic level, crypto is designed to be a form of digital cash. It can be used to purchase goods and services online and, increasingly, at physical stores. This peer-to-peer system allows value to be transferred directly from one person to another without needing a bank to process the transaction. 2. A High-Growth Investment Vehicle This is the most well-known use. Many people buy cryptocurrencies hoping their value will appreciate significantly over time. While highly volatile, the potential for high returns has attracted millions of investors worldwide, making crypto a prominent, albeit risky, asset class. 3. A Tool for Global Financial Inclusion Billions of people worldwide lack access to traditional banking services. The only requirements to use crypto are an internet connection and a digital wallet. This opens the door for underserved populations to participate in the global financial system, save money, and make transactions securely. 4. Faster & Cheaper Global Transactions Traditional international bank transfers can take 3-5 business days and often involve high fees. Cryptocurrency transactions can be settled in minutes, regardless of geography, and typically at a fraction of the cost. This makes it a powerful tool for remittances and international trade. 5. Power Through Decentralization Because cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any single government or company, they offer users a degree of financial autonomy. This decentralization makes the network resistant to censorship or manipulation by a central authority, a key philosophical pillar of the crypto movement. For more on this, major financial publications like Forbes often discuss the implications of decentralization. 6. A Potential Hedge Against Inflation Some cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, have a fixed supply limit. For Bitcoin, only 21 million coins will ever exist. This scarcity leads some investors to believe it can act as a “digital gold”—a store of value that is resistant to inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of traditional, government-issued currencies. 7. Radical Transparency with Blockchain Most cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology, which is a public, distributed ledger. Every transaction is recorded on this ledger and is visible to anyone. This transparency can help prevent fraud and corruption, as all movements of funds are open for public scrutiny. 8. Enhanced User Privacy While all transactions are public, the identities of the parties involved are pseudonymous—represented by a cryptographic wallet address, not personal information. This provides a layer of privacy that is often greater than traditional banking systems, where personal data is collected and stored by a central institution. Navigating the Risks: The Critical Considerations of Crypto No discussion of the crypto purpose is complete without addressing its significant risks. Before engaging with digital assets, it’s crucial to be aware of the following: Extreme Volatility: Prices can and do fluctuate dramatically in very short periods. It’s not uncommon for a cryptocurrency’s value to swing by over 10% in a single day. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments around the world are still deciding how to regulate cryptocurrencies. New laws could significantly impact their value and legality. Security Risks: If you lose your private keys (the password to your digital wallet), you lose access to your funds forever. Hacking of exchanges and scams are also prevalent threats. Environmental Impact: The “mining” process for some major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, is energy-intensive and has raised significant environmental concerns. If you are considering investing, it is essential to conduct thorough research. You can [ read our detailed guide on “How to Invest in Cryptocurrency Safely” ]([Internal Link Placeholder]) to learn more. Conclusion: A Technology of Potential and Prudence The purpose of crypto is rich and varied. It is simultaneously a new financial system, an investment asset, a political statement about decentralization, and a practical tool for global transactions. Its potential to reshape our digital world is immense, but it is accompanied by equally significant risks. Understanding both sides of this powerful technology is the first step toward navigating its landscape safely and effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is the main purpose of cryptocurrency? The main purpose of cryptocurrency is to act as a secure, decentralized digital currency that can be used for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority like a bank. It also serves as an investment asset and a tool for financial inclusion. Is crypto only for investment? No. While many people use crypto for investment, its core functions include acting as a medium of exchange for goods and services, enabling cheaper and faster international remittances, and providing financial services to those without access to traditional banks. What are the biggest risks of using crypto? The biggest risks include extreme price volatility, the potential for total loss of funds through security breaches or losing private keys, and an uncertain regulatory environment where new laws could negatively impact the market. How does crypto provide privacy? Crypto provides privacy through pseudonymity. While transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, they are tied to a cryptographic address, not a person’s real-world identity. This makes it more private than traditional banking, which requires sharing personal information. This post What is crypto pur?

2025-07-12T11:35:38,"Crypto Investor Ryan Sean Adams Calls Ethereum the Next World Reserve Asset","The post Crypto Investor Ryan Sean Adams Calls Ethereum the Next World Reserve Asset appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has finally broken above the key $2,850 resistance level, jumping 15% this week to trade around $2,955. The move has stirred fresh excitement across the altcoin market, with rising trading volume hinting that a new altseason might be underway – a period where altcoins outperform Bitcoin and deliver bigger gains. With Ethereum reclaiming major technical levels and a strong new narrative building, many investors are starting to ask: Is ETH stepping into a much bigger role in the global financial system? “Blue Money” Revolution: Ethereum’s Bold Rebrand Ryan Sean Adams, founder of Mythos Capital, is one of the most vocal supporters of Ethereum’s evolving identity. In a recent post on X, he credited the community’s efforts: “The ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months.” Adams’ “blue money” concept recasts Ethereum not just as infrastructure for decentralized apps, but as a yield-generating, store-of-value asset backed by a real on-chain economy. While Bitcoin is seen as digital gold and oil remains a classic store of value, ETH offers something more – security and productivity. His big idea? Ethereum has the potential to become a global reserve asset and that’s now catching the attention of both retail and institutional investors. The ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months. We are emphasizing ETH the asset now. A store of value like gold, oil, and bitcoin – but backed by an economy with yield. It's made a huge difference. Keep going. ETH = world reserve asset https://t.co/e9GD4YeKNQ — RYAN SΞAN ADAMS – rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) July 11, 2025 Breaking Out: ETH Regains Key Support Zones After weeks of moving sideways, ETH has broken through with strength, reclaiming both the 100-week and 200-week moving averages, currently sitting at $2,644 and $2,428. This kind of technical reclaim often signals that a downtrend could be over and a new bullish phase is beginning. The $2,850 level has long been a major zone of resistance and support. With ETH now trading above it, analysts are eyeing the next targets at $3,300 to $3,600. If momentum holds, a push toward $4,000 is well within reach. Despite this progress, ETH is still trading about 60% below its all-time high of nearly $4,900 from November 2021, leaving plenty of room for upside if this rally continues. Ethereum’s Comeback Opportunity Since 2022, Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin, frustrating many holders. While BTC has hit fresh all-time highs, ETH is still playing catch-up. But that underperformance is now being seen as a potential opportunity. Adams believes the market is starting to take a fresh look at ETH. “We are emphasizing ETH, the asset now,” he wrote on X, urging the community to keep building on this momentum. If the idea of Ethereum as a reserve asset gains wider support, it could help ETH close the gap with Bitcoin and even shift the balance of power across the crypto market. Altcoins Follow Ethereum’s Lead Ethereum’s breakout is lifting the rest of the altcoin market too, with several tokens showing strong gains in its wake. This kind of broad move often signals confidence returning to riskier parts of the market and positions ETH as the trendsetter for the altcoin space. Still, the rally isn’t without risk. If ETH drops back below $2,850, the recent momentum could fade, and lower support levels may be tested again. But for now, Ethereum is leading the charge.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-investor-ryan-sean-adams-calls-ethereum-the-next-world-reserve-asset/,"ETH|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T11:29:38,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC At Record Levels As It Heads Into Crucial “Crypto Week”","Bitcoin (BTC) set a fresh record on Friday, surging to $118,856 as the flagship cryptocurrency’s record-breaking rally continues. BTC bulls have set their eyes on the $120,000 mark as the flagship cryptocurrency heads into a crucial week with the price at record levels. Price action has slowed down over the past 24 hours, with the price marginally down, trading around $118,139. Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Triggers $1.2 billion in Liquidations Bitcoin’s (BTC) record-breaking rally has led to over $1 billion in bearish positions liquidated over the past 24 hours. Over 279,000 traders were liquidated as the flagship cryptocurrency raced to its latest all-time high. According to data from Coinglass, the largest liquidation, valued at around $88 million, occurred on HTX. Augustine Fan, partner at crypto trading platform SignalPlus, stated, “The conditions for a slow grind higher have been in place for some time. Today’s move appears to be a product of that setup.” Bitcoin was trading in a tight range since May but broke out of it on Thursday after President Trump unleashed his latest trade salvo, sending stocks into a tizzy. BTC crossed $115,000 by Thursday and surged past $118,000 on Friday as bullish sentiment returned to crypto. Several factors are fueling the latest rally, including record ETF inflows and a Congressional committee declaring next week as “Crypto Week.” There are also indications that China is rethinking its stance on digital assets. A Crucial Week For Bitcoin (BTC) And Crypto Bitcoin (BTC) heads into a landmark week for the crypto industry, with the US House of Representatives set to discuss three crucial crypto bills, which could provide much-needed regulatory clarity. Lawmakers will discuss the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, with signs that recently strained ties between Washington and the crypto industry are beginning to thaw. A regulatory framework could encourage companies to adopt Bitcoin into their treasury strategy, following the lead set by firms like Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR). The GENIUS Act will allow private companies to issue stablecoins. President Trump has already announced his support for the bill on social media. Meanwhile, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act will establish a framework for crypto regulation. The third bill, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Investors are lining up to take positions ahead of next week. Analysts expect that capital previously sidelined due to regulatory uncertainty will re-enter the market. Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex, believes even if the final passage of the bills stalls, the optics of legislative engagement could push the market higher. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) reached new highs on three consecutive days, with the flagship cryptocurrency’s market dominance sitting around 64%, down 1.53% over the past week. However, altcoins also registered significant price jumps as BTC reached record levels, with Ethereum (ETH) reclaiming $3,000 and Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) breaking past key levels. With Bitcoin dominance remaining steady, analysts believe fresh capital is flowing into the wider market, helping prominent altcoins gain market share. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping 1.09% on Monday and 1.33% on Tuesday to settle at $105,740. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845.

The RSI at 61.62 shows growing strength but not yet overbought. Increased volume (+36.32%) and a breakout from consolidation hint at renewed investor interest. With the $166.56 resistance now tested, SOL could trend higher if momentum holds. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $145 $170 $195 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.94 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $750M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

With prices now hovering near record highs, still, analysts are eyeing more gains towards the $135 target. It seems the BTC market is gearing up for a massive shift. Keep reading to know why. Long-Term Holders Absorb Supply: Bullish Pressure Intensifies According to a recent Glassnode post on X it reveals that the Bitcoin balance on exchanges is continuing to decline. This indicates towards the trend largely attributed to long-term holders absorbing more BTC than what miners are issuing. This means that less BTC is available for trading, tightening supply and laying the groundwork for upward price pressure. “ #BTC balance on exchanges dropping = supply shock” is a meme. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t supply constraints – long-term holders are absorbing more $BTC than miners issue. That’s where pressure builds. pic.twitter.com/OZtboXM0BM — glassnode (@glassnode) July 12, 2025 This behavior shows growing conviction among holders who are less likely to sell in the short term and it is directly seen as a bullish case. Analysts Turn Ultra-Bullish: $135K in Sight? Adding fuel to the fire, popular crypto analyst MisterCrypto has pointed out that Bitcoin is breaking out of a classic bull flag pattern, which traditionally signals continuation of an uptrend. In his analysis, he predicts that the current rally is far from over. Bitcoin is breaking out of this bull flag. MASSIVE PUMP INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/cgu5VpZFhv — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) July 12, 2025 This aligns with the growing technical evidence suggesting Bitcoin may have entered a price discovery phase, where previous resistances no longer apply and the market is free to find new highs. BlackRock and Big Money Bet Big on BTC Institutional investors are also making significant moves.

2025-07-12T11:06:06,"Bitcoin Investors Favor Accumulation Over Distribution Amid Price Surge: Glassnode","In the past two months, Bitcoin investors have favored accumulation over distribution. BTC’s price movement this week did not change that. Despite the asset hitting new highs this week, there is still a supply crunch, indicating that investors would rather accumulate than distribute their holdings. The market research firm Glassnode reported that these investor moves suggest they see current prices as offering relatively compelling value. Bitcoin Investors Are Accumulating Analyzing the raw Accumulation Trend Score, Glassnode discovered that this intense accumulation wave emerged when BTC first rallied past $100,000. After the breakout, investors gradually began to distribute more, and this gave way to stalled price action for a while. Following the all-time high (ATH) of over $111,000 in May, BTC saw renewed accumulation pressures, which have remained elevated since then. The accumulation metric hovered above its historical average even as BTC sat through an extended consolidation phase. It is still above the average. “This suggests that investors increasingly see the current range as a more favorable environment, despite price conditions being similar to those during the previous distribution phase in late-2024,” Glassnode said. Long-term Holder Supply Grows The persistent accumulation among investors is evident in the growing long-term holder (LTH) BTC supply. Evaluating the 30-day growth in LTH supply, Glassnode discovered that accumulation by this investor cohort is outpacing the monthly coin issuance. Miners are producing about 13,400 BTC monthly, but LTHs are increasing their balances at a pace of 19,300 BTC per month. Bitcoin investors holding less than 100 BTC are also in accumulation mode. The cohorts, categorized into Shrimps ( This accumulation trend suggests that supply-side conditions are tightening, with LTHs absorbing newly issued supply at a fast pace. Glassnode noted that these investors have become price-insensitive as they accumulate and are unwilling to distribute their assets at current market prices. Analysts believe they are waiting for more meaningful market action before they start distributing. Meanwhile, on-chain and derivatives market indicators are flashing signals of elevated volatility in the coming weeks. The supply-side tightening has made the market susceptible to demand shocks, and moderate fluctuations can trigger significant price volatility. Glassnode said the coiling and compression of prices across multiple timeframes support this observation.

2025-07-12T11:03:29,"XRP Price Could Jump to $4 While You Sleep This Week, Says Crypto Analyst","The post XRP Price Could Jump to $4 While You Sleep This Week, Says Crypto Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is back in the spotlight this week after a strong rally pushed its price to $2.77, up more than 7% in the last 24 hours. The token briefly touched $2.96 earlier today, its highest level in four months and now, market watchers say the next big move may come fast. “Don’t be surprised if you wake up randomly this week and $XRP is $4+,” said crypto analyst Edoardo Farina, hinting at a potential breakout that could push XRP past its 2018 all-time high of $3.84. If that happens, XRP would gain nearly 50% from current levels. It’s a bold call, but one that’s gaining support as momentum builds across the broader crypto market . Don’t be surprised if you wake up randomly this week and $XRP is $4+ — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 12, 2025 XRP Surges While Altcoin Season Hasn’t Even Started Despite the rally, most analysts agree that altcoin season hasn’t officially begun. The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 28 out of 100, suggesting Bitcoin is still leading the market . That makes XRP’s current 25% weekly gain even more notable. If this is how it’s performing before the altcoin wave hits, many believe the upside could be much higher once the full cycle kicks in. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Is Driving Fresh Optimism Adding to the excitement is Ripple’s recent progress with RLUSD, its new stablecoin. Last week, Ripple named BNY Mellon , the oldest U.S. bank, as the official custodian for RLUSD reserves. Ripple is also working to secure a national bank license and a Federal Reserve master account, which could give RLUSD a major advantage in the regulated stablecoin space. RLUSD has now crossed $500 million in market cap, becoming the eighth-largest stablecoin, and it runs on the XRP Ledger. Since XRP is used to pay transaction fees, this is directly boosting its utility. ETF Launches Coming This Month The XRP rally is also being powered by ETF developments. Several futures-based XRP ETFs are set to launch in July: ProShares will release three products by July 14 Turtle Capital’s 2x Long XRP ETF launches on July 21 Volatility Shares also plans to debut two XRP ETFs the same day At the same time, over 10 spot ETF applications are still under review by the SEC. While none have been approved yet, the growing interest is pushing confidence higher. Whale Activity Hits Record Levels Behind the scenes, XRP whales are making big moves. Data from Santiment shows there are now 2,742 wallets holding at least 1 million XRP, just one wallet short of the all-time high. Together, these large holders now control over 47.32 billion XRP, which is a sign of rising long-term confidence in the token. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Takes Aim at $685B Remittance Market , “Going All-In on XRP Should Be a Priority,” Says Analyst Well-known crypto commentator Oscar Ramos says investors shouldn’t take this momentum lightly.

Going ALL IN on $XRP should be a priority — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) July 9, 2025 Ramos isn’t alone. Influencer Alex Cobb has predicted XRP could reach $22.50 by December, pointing to strong market structure and growing demand. Between its price rally, ETF launches, whale accumulation, and Ripple’s stablecoin push, XRP is showing strength on multiple fronts. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Charm of Reachy Mini: Hugging Face’s Unconventional Approach Hugging Face, a name synonymous with open-source AI models and tools, has taken an unexpected leap into physical products with the launch of its programmable Reachy Mini bots. These aren’t your typical sophisticated industrial robots. Instead, they are open-source, powered by Raspberry Pi, and adorned with charmingly cartoonish antennae and big googly eyes. Their initial appeal lies precisely in what they don’t do out of the box. As Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast hosts Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha discussed, the Reachy Mini embodies the ‘Seinfeld of AI hardware’ – doing nothing in particular, yet captivating an audience. This unconventional design choice, combined with their open-source nature, suggests a deliberate strategy. Instead of a highly specialized tool, Hugging Face is offering a versatile platform.

This impressive figure underscores a significant market appetite for accessible, programmable AI hardware, even if its immediate purpose isn’t clearly defined. It suggests that consumers and developers are keen to get their hands on platforms that offer flexibility and the potential for future innovation, rather than just pre-packaged solutions. The rapid sales success could be attributed to several factors: Hugging Face’s Brand Reputation: Their strong standing in the AI community likely generated significant pre-launch interest. Novelty and Charm: The robot’s unique, approachable design makes it appealing beyond just technical enthusiasts. Developer Interest: The open-source nature attracts a strong developer community eager to build and experiment. The ‘Seinfeld’ Factor: The very concept of a robot that ‘does nothing’ sparks curiosity and invites users to define its purpose. This initial success provides valuable data points for companies exploring the monetization of physical products in the AI hardware space, particularly those with a strong software or platform background. Broader Tech Insights from Bitcoin World’s Equity Podcast The Equity podcast episode also delved into other significant tech news, offering a wider perspective on the current landscape beyond just AI robots. These discussions highlight the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the tech industry: Grok’s Wild Week and Linda Yaccarino’s Exit from X: The rapid developments surrounding Elon Musk’s AI venture, Grok, and the abrupt departure of X’s CEO, Linda Yaccarino, underscore the volatile nature of leadership and product strategy in high-profile tech companies. Rivian’s Micromobility Spinoff, Also: The news of Rivian’s spinoff, Also, securing an additional $200 million for e-bikes, even without a launched product, highlights the continued investor confidence in sustainable transportation and micromobility solutions. This shows that visionary ideas, even pre-product, can attract substantial funding in certain sectors. LangChain’s Billion-Dollar Valuation: LangChain reportedly closing a new funding round that would push its valuation to $1 billion, partly due to a pivot towards monetizing its developer tools, signifies the immense value being placed on foundational AI development frameworks and the shift towards monetizing developer-centric platforms. These diverse topics from the podcast paint a picture of an industry in constant flux, driven by innovation, strategic pivots, and significant investment, all of which ultimately impact the broader digital economy, including the crypto market. The Future is Open: The Potential of Programmable AI Robots The emergence of devices like the Reachy Mini signals a fascinating direction for the future of AI Robots . Rather than being confined to industrial settings or highly specialized tasks, these accessible, programmable platforms could foster a new wave of personal and educational robotics. Imagine classrooms where students learn coding and AI by programming their own googly-eyed bots, or homes where users customize their robots for simple, quirky tasks tailored to their unique needs. This shift towards more open and user-defined AI hardware could parallel the early days of personal computing, where general-purpose machines became platforms for countless unforeseen applications. Hugging Face’s gamble on the Reachy Mini’s ‘nothing in particular’ nature might just be a brilliant move, inviting the community to fill the void with endless possibilities, thereby unlocking its true, revolutionary potential. Conclusion: A New Paradigm for AI Hardware Hugging Face’s Reachy Mini, with its charming simplicity and open-source foundation, represents a compelling new paradigm in AI hardware.

2025-07-12T10:53:19,"Crypto Analyst: Altcoins Rally Strongly While Bitcoin Dominance Remains Unshaken","Despite Bitcoin maintaining a steady grip on the market, many altcoins are experiencing significant price surges, suggesting ample room for further upside in the broader crypto market. Key Takeaways: Altcoins are rallying strongly alongside Bitcoin, despite Bitcoin’s dominance at 64%. The usual signal for an altseason, a drop in Bitcoin dominance, is absent. However, analysts indicate the altcoin season is underway. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland noted on X that “BTC dominance hasn’t even sneezed and Alts are ripping,” highlighting the recent momentum in altcoins alongside Bitcoin’s steady dominance. At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 64.46%, down just 1.53% over the past week, even as Bitcoin climbed to new all-time highs — reaching $118,760 on Friday. Declining Bitcoin Dominance Typically Signals Start of Altseason Traditionally, a decline in Bitcoin dominance signals the start of an “altseason,” where altcoins gain market share. However, the current surge in altcoins without a significant drop in Bitcoin dominance may indicate fresh capital flowing into the entire crypto ecosystem rather than a shift away from Bitcoin. Among the top performers over the past week, MemeCore (M) led with a staggering 1,263% rally, followed by Mog Coin (MOG) up 75% and Stellar (XLM) rising 67%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, increased by 17.68% over the same period, with the ETH/BTC ratio climbing 8.39%, reinforcing traders’ expectations of a growing focus on altcoins. However, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index still reads “Bitcoin Season,” with a score of 29 out of 100, indicating that Bitcoin remains the dominant market driver. Yet, traders like Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, believe the market is approaching the “final easy and biggest bull ever on Altcoins.” “Trading Altcoins is difficult, that’s why the downwards corrections are extremely challenging and the upwards returns enormous,” he said. Cases like $OMNI are basically the reason why I tend to be into positions early. Especially if I'm willing to go full risk-on (I assume that we're about to witness the final easy and biggest bull ever on #Altcoins ), then I'd rather want to be early than buying after such a move.… — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 11, 2025 Data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment also supports this view, confirming that altcoin season has started. Santiment added that as long as Bitcoin holds above key psychological support near $110,000, traders will likely continue reallocating profits into altcoins, fueling further growth in the broader crypto market. Bitcoin Surpasses Silver in Market Cap Bitcoin’s market capitalization has surged past silver’s, reaching $2.34 trillion after the cryptocurrency hit a fresh all-time high above $118,000. The milestone places Bitcoin sixth among the world’s largest assets , surpassing silver’s $2.16 trillion market cap, according to Companies Market Cap data. Bitcoin is closing in on the top five assets, with Amazon’s $2.37 trillion market cap now within reach. Behind Bitcoin and silver are tech giants Google and Meta, valued at $1.15 trillion and $1.79 trillion, respectively. However, gold remains the dominant asset with a massive $22.6 trillion market cap. NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple follow, holding market caps in the $3 to $4 trillion range, well ahead of Bitcoin for now. Institutional demand has been a key driver, supporting Bitcoin’s consolidation above $100,000 before its recent price surge. Mercuryo CEO Petr Kozyakov noted that institutional interest continues to push Bitcoin’s value higher, underscoring its rising appeal as a store of value alongside altcoins like Ethereum, which recently surpassed $3,000.

2025-07-12T10:49:24,"Is Silver a Better Financial Instrument than Bitcoin? Peter Schiff Slams Critics","Bitcoin breaks new highs, but Silver’s steady rise attracts investors, citing a safe bet. Silver hits highest level since 2011, trailing Bitcoin’s rally but with less risk. Peter Schiff urges Bitcoin investors to shift to Silver, calling it a safer hedge with upside. As Bitcoin makes another remarkable feat of pushing to $118K, a debate has re-emerged among market observers over the merits of traditional assets with digital ones. With the king of crypto steadily progressing, a metal had also caught the attention of investors, but it is not gold this time. Silver, the often overlooked precious metal, had hit its highest, prompting analysts to suggest it’s time for investors to rebalance. Sharing tweets on X for two consecutive days, Peter Schiff stated that BTC investors could sell some of the asset and buy the metal. Following the thread on the following day, Schiff slammed investors for ignoring the price breakout of Silver. Notably, the price of Silver had gained around 4.3% over the past five days, reaching about $38.38 per ounce on Saturday during the early European trading session. Meanwhile, Bitcoin gained around 9% over the past week, moving t… The post Is Silver a Better Financial Instrument than Bitcoin?

2025-07-12T10:40:19,"Pundit Says Selling Your XRP at $10 Will Be a Once-in-a-Lifetime Mistake","Prominent crypto founder Edoardo Farina has warned XRP investors against exiting too early, as XRP prepares for the moon. In a recent tweet , Farina asserted that selling XRP at $10 could be a catastrophic mistake. Essentially, his argument infers that many investors may lock in short-term profits without realizing how much higher the asset could climb in upcoming market cycles.According to Farina, exiting the market at $10 may lead to long-term regret. This could be true, especially if XRP fulfills its potential during the next phase of adoption and institutional integration. Edoardo Farina on X Edoardo Farina on X Currently, XRP is trading at $2.44, and it still faces a formidable journey before reaching heights like $10. Yet, some XRP proponents are already warning against selling at a price that, while not guaranteed, may still be far below its ultimate potential.Lifetime Regret from Selling XRP Too EarlyFarina's perspective draws on the psychological impact of selling too soon, a mistake that has historically locked many investors out of significant gains.For instance, when XRP broke out in November 2024 and surpassed $1 for the first time in over three years, some expected a retracement to $0.50. But that pullback never came. The coin soon hit $2, and those who sold at $1 were left in regret.Looking further into XRP’s history, the coin has achieved significant milestones, many of which early sellers may now regret missing out on. Since early 2017, XRP has erased two zeros from its price, and today, investors can only buy it at unit prices far higher than its early days.Taking Inspiration from Bitcoin HoldersA similar pattern is evident with Bitcoin. It once traded under $0.05, and although those who sold at $10 made massive profits at the time, many likely regret that decision now, with Bitcoin trading over $117,000.Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) recently shared a personal reflection on this. Despite buying Bitcoin at $600 in 2013, CZ says he still feels behind compared to early adopters who bought in at just $0.10. His comments come as several early Bitcoin holders have recently emerged after over a decade of dormancy to cash out billions in BTC acquired below $1.https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1941293675331584290Essentially, prominent XRP commentators are urging today’s investors to remain patient. They believe XRP’s future may mirror the long-term success seen by early Bitcoin adopters. As such, they warn that selling at $10, despite representing a 300% gain from current levels, may become a regretful decision in hindsight.What Experts Say About XRP’s Future Price PotentialLofty price predictions circulating within the XRP community include targets of $100, $1,000, and even $10,000.For example, Farina has previously stated that he plans to take some profits when XRP surpasses $100. Analysts like Javon Marks have predicted that XRP could reach $100 during this market cycle, possibly by 2025 or 2026. However, many market watchers remain skeptical of these projections.Meanwhile, crypto analyst Matthew Brienen believes XRP could reach $1,000 by 2035. If that 10-year outlook materializes, today’s patient holders could see a staggering 40,700% gain, compared to just 300% from a $10 exit.An even more audacious projection comes from crypto founder Jake Claver. In a viral video, Claver claimed he expects XRP to trade at $10,000 per coin by 2027, driven by its efficiency in global payments.Ultimately, while some traders may view $10 as a reasonable point to take profits, voices like Farina’s advocate for a longer-term perspective, still, others argue it’s better to secure profits while they’re available rather than gamble on a future that may never materialize.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/12/pundit-says-selling-your-xrp-at-10-will-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-mistake/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-says-selling-your-xrp-at-10-will-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-mistake,"XRP|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T10:30:45,"Bitcoin Dominance Continues Historic Climb – Altcoins Struggle To Gain Ground","Bitcoin has officially entered a new chapter in its bull market, surging to fresh all-time highs near $118,800 after weeks of tight consolidation. This decisive breakout marks a pivotal shift in momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential explosive leg higher as bullish sentiment returns. The move above previous highs has not only reignited interest in BTC but also fueled optimism across the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 – Price Magnet Forming One of the most telling indicators of the current cycle’s strength is Bitcoin Dominance. According to top analyst On-Chain Mind, BTC dominance has climbed to 65% since the beginning of this bull market. This sharp increase highlights a clear preference among investors for Bitcoin over altcoins, solidifying its position as the market’s anchor in times of volatility and growth. As Bitcoin leads the charge, market watchers believe the breakout could trigger a wave of institutional inflows and renewed attention from sidelined retail investors. With momentum building and confidence growing, the breakout above $118K may just be the start of an even larger move, one that could define the next phase of the 2025 crypto bull cycle. Bitcoin Leads The Charge After weeks of sideways consolidation below the $110,000 mark, Bitcoin has finally broken out, launching a new bullish phase and pushing the broader crypto market into motion. Altcoins, which had lagged in recent months, are now climbing above key resistance levels as confidence spreads. This coordinated move comes amid a backdrop of macroeconomic shifts, with market participants increasingly anticipating a weakening US dollar and the return of inflationary policies under US President Donald Trump’s administration. With expectations of rate cuts looming and pressure mounting on the Federal Reserve, the market sees crypto—especially Bitcoin—as a natural hedge. However, caution still lingers. US Treasury yields remain elevated, continuing to flash warnings of systemic stress in the traditional financial system. That tension has only strengthened Bitcoin’s appeal as a non-sovereign, hard-capped monetary asset. Bitcoin dominance tells the story clearly. “At the start of this bull market, it sat at 40%. Today? 65%,” noted On-Chain Mind, emphasizing how investor preference has overwhelmingly leaned toward BTC. This dominance reflects a trend that has barely flinched, even as Ethereum and other altcoins attempt to catch up. As BTC leads the market higher, its dominance reinforces its role as the primary beneficiary of macro uncertainty. While the altcoin space is beginning to show signs of life, it’s clear that Bitcoin remains the anchor, and investors aren’t ready to rotate just yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Oscillator Predicts First Sell Pressure Level At $130,900 – Details 4‑Hour Chart: Post‑Breakout Cooling Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart shows a clean breakout followed by consolidation, a typical sign of strength after an impulsive move. Price surged from the long-standing resistance at $109,300 to a local high of $118,000 in less than twelve hours, marking an 8% rally. This breakout flipped prior resistance into support and triggered strong volume, validating the move. Volume has decreased during this period, which is characteristic of a bullish consolidation rather than distribution. The 50-period moving average (blue) has crossed above the 100-period (green), forming a short-term golden cross near $109K. This crossover supports a bullish outlook, with the 200-period moving average (red) trending upward from $105K, reinforcing the structure of higher lows. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level – Relief Or Reversal? As long as Bitcoin remains above $112K, bulls are firmly in control.

2025-07-12T10:30:41,"Think Before You Tap: Tasmania’s Crypto ATM Craze Turns Into $1.6M Scam Disaster","Tasmania’s law enforcement agencies are intensifying their scrutiny of cryptocurrency ATMs following the discovery that the most active users in the region have been victims of fraudulent schemes. According to a new announcement from Tasmania Police Cyber Investigations, the top 15 users of crypto ATMs across the state have all fallen prey to scams, resulting in a combined loss of approximately 2.5 million Australian dollars (USD $1.6 million). Notably, around $592,000 of this total was funneled through crypto ATMs. The findings are part of a broader national enforcement initiative aimed at curbing the misuse of cryptocurrency kiosks across Australia. Scammers Direct Victims to Crypto ATMs After Banks Flag Suspicious Activity The operation is being spearheaded by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in collaboration with AUSTRAC, the nation’s financial intelligence unit. Tasmania’s involvement highlights how local jurisdictions are aligning with federal efforts to tighten oversight of crypto-related activities, particularly in response to the rising use of ATMs for illicit transactions. Detective Sergeant Paul Turner of the Tasmania Police stated that in many cases, victims had originally attempted to send funds through traditional banking channels. When banks flagged and blocked those transfers due to suspicious activity, scammers redirected the victims to use cryptocurrency ATMs as an alternative. This move bypassed traditional financial safeguards and allowed fraudulent transactions to proceed. Turner emphasized that the scams frequently involve high-stakes financial manipulation, often masquerading as investment opportunities or romantic connections. “Victims are being manipulated, intimidated, and pressured into investing in fake investment and romance scams,” he said. The repercussions can be severe, with many individuals reportedly forced to delay retirement, sell personal assets, or rely on social support systems due to the financial impact. Turner advised the public to be wary of anyone instructing them to use a digital currency ATM, especially if the request is urgent or comes from someone they have never met in person. ATM Expansion and New Compliance Measures Reflect Growing Risks The number of crypto ATMs in Tasmania has risen sharply in recent years, from just one machine in 2021 to over 20 by mid-2025. Data from Coin ATM Radar confirms there are currently 24 operational crypto ATMs in the state. Nationally, Australia is now the third-largest country in terms of crypto ATM installations , trailing only the United States and Canada. The total number of machines across the country has grown from just 67 in August 2022 to over 1,890 today. In response to mounting concerns, AUSTRAC implemented updated operational rules and new transaction limits for digital currency ATM operators starting June 3. The agency has also designated cryptocurrency-related activity as a regulatory priority heading into 2025. Major ATM providers in the country include Localcoin with 807 units, Coinflip with 691, and Bitcoin Depot with 212, reflecting the scale and accessibility of these machines for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes.

2025-07-12T10:27:17,"XRP Price Prediction: Investors on High Alert for July 14, 21, 25 – What’s Next for XRP?","XRP price has broken $2.80 as optimism around ETFs grows. The market is watching three key dates, July 14, 21, and 25, which could open up institutional access to XRP. The coin is up 7% in the last 24 hours on ETF speculation and broader crypto strength. It all started when ProShares announced they would be launching three XRP futures ETFs—Ultra XRP, UltraShort XRP, and Short XRP—on July 14. These products will allow both bulls and bears to get leveraged exposure to Ripple.

If approved, these funds will allow institutions to hedge or speculate on XRP more efficiently. ETF Launch Date: July 14 (ProShares Futures ETFs) Product Types: Long & Short Leverage Market Impact: Higher liquidity, more institutional activity The futures strategy could also be a stepping stone for spot ETFs, similar to Bitcoin’s regulatory path in the US.

These products amplify daily returns—perfect for active traders looking to trade Ripple volatility. JUST IN: ProShares XRP ETF set to begin trading July 18, 2025. Documented. pic.twitter.com/7sUmG8i2oy — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 11, 2025 Both have completed regulatory steps, so there is a high probability of launch. If these ETFs go live, it will be the first time XRP has had multiple leveraged products in the US, which could increase volume and short-term price action. ETF Launch Date: July 21 Providers: Volatility Shares, Tuttle Capital Product: 2X Leveraged Long XRP ETFs Implication: More trading volume, volatility-driven opportunities These products will attract momentum traders and algorithmic funds that previously avoided XRP due to regulatory uncertainty. Spot XRP ETF Decision on July 25 The biggest news comes on July 25, when the SEC is expected to rule on the REX-Osprey Spot XRP ETF. Unlike futures ETFs, this will hold XRP directly, providing institutions with a regulated way to gain exposure without owning the asset itself. With court decisions going in Ripple’s favor and pressure mounting on the SEC to modernize its crypto approach, analysts think approval is getting more likely. If approved, this would not only be a green light but could open the door for other issuers like Bitwise and 21Shares to follow. Decision Date: July 25 ETF Type: Spot XRP ETF Issuer: REX Shares / Osprey Market Outlook: Institutional FOMO, new highs A spot ETF approval could be the catalyst, unlocking billions in capital and solidifying XRP’s top 10 status. XRP Chart Outlook: Overbought but Bullish From a technical standpoint, XRP price prediction continues to stay bullish as it is consolidating at $2.81 after a parabolic move above a rising channel. The price cleared the $2.695 resistance zone, which is now support. XPR/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, a Shooting Star on the 4-hour chart suggests possible exhaustion, particularly given the RSI’s position above 79, which is profound in overbought territory. Trade Setup: Buy Zone: $2.695–$2.62 (on dip) Stop Loss: $2.48 Targets: $2.97 short term, $3.14–$3.31 next resistance Watch for: Bullish engulfing or hammer candle Volume is tapering off, so patience is required. A dip would be a better entry. With ETFs dominating the July narrative, XRP could be entering a significant chapter. Now it’s all eyes on the regulators, and if approvals align, XRP may retest all-time highs.

2025-07-12T10:00:00,"Bitcoin’s all-time high fuels $1B in liquidations as ETH, XRP, MOG soar double digits","After being stuck in a month-long consolidation range between $100,000 and $110,000, Bitcoin broke out and set multiple all-time highs during the week. The total crypto market capitalisation climbed 10.88% over the week to $3.77 trillion, revisiting levels last seen in January. Market sentiment continued to strengthen, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising to 71. However, it remained below the June peak, indicating room for further upside. With risk sentiment replenished, altcoins closed the week in profit, as the rally extended across the broader market. Why is Bitcoin price increasing? Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $118,667 as of late Asian trading hours on Friday after rallying more than 10% over the past seven days. The breakout triggered one of the most severe short squeezes in recent years, wiping out over $1 billion in short positions within 24 hours, the largest daily liquidation event since 2021. According to CoinGlass, more than 232,000 traders were liquidated, with Bitcoin shorts accounting for over $570 million. The squeeze was amplified by high leverage and aggressive positioning around key resistance levels. Many high-leverage short positions were forced to close as Bitcoin surged through technical thresholds, further fuelling upward momentum. Rising institutional demand has also underpinned Bitcoin’s uptrend. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, launched earlier this year, continue to see steady inflows, with total net additions crossing $51 billion. On Thursday, the market recorded its second-largest daily inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs since launch, totalling $1.17 billion. Bitcoin’s breakout past $113,800 acted as a catalyst, driving inflows and sustaining bullish sentiment into Friday. Momentum has also been buoyed by growing optimism around the macroeconomic outlook. Traders are pricing in interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, with expectations that easing could begin as early as September. Fed officials like Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman have recently hinted at short-term rate cuts. Markets also anticipate accelerated cuts in 2026, should Donald Trump nominate a more dovish Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell. Historically, Bitcoin has benefited from looser monetary policy and low interest rates, which drive risk-on sentiment across asset classes. Meanwhile, crypto investors are closely watching political developments in Washington ahead of the “Crypto Week.” Lawmakers are scheduled to review three major bills in the coming week, including the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, the CLARITY Act to define regulatory roles between the SEC and CFTC, and a proposed ban on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). There’s also renewed speculation that China could ease its stance on digital assets. If that happens, such a move could unlock significant retail demand from Chinese investors. How high can Bitcoin go? With Bitcoin now in price discovery, market participants are eyeing higher targets ranging from $120,000 to as high as $250,000 over the coming months. The breakout above $113,800 has opened the door to a potential extension of the rally, especially as technical and macroeconomic conditions continue to align. In a July 10 media note, 10x Research head Markus Thielen estimated a 60% probability that Bitcoin could climb more than 20% in the next two months. This would put BTC above $140,000 by September if the uptrend holds. Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead echoed a similarly bullish outlook, projecting a $150,000 target based on ongoing ETF inflows, macro tailwinds, and expanding institutional adoption. Some analysts are even more optimistic. Pseudonymous trader Shibo, for instance, shared a fractal comparison of the 2020–2021 and 2024–2025 cycles, suggesting that Bitcoin’s current structure mirrors the early stages of its last major bull run. BTC/USD historical price trends. Source: Shibo. If the pattern plays out similarly, Shibo sees a $250,000 target as “programmed” over the next six months. A separate report by Keyrock outlined a potential path to $160,000 by year-end, provided corporate treasuries continue holding Bitcoin and macro conditions remain stable. However, the firm noted that it views $135,000 as a more probable year-end baseline but does not rule out a push toward the upper bound if risk sentiment persists. Others, however, are more cautious in the short term. CryptoOrca, who previously identified $120,000 as a key round-number resistance, now anticipates a short-term cooldown. (See below.) CryptOrca @CryptOrca · Follow $BTC $120k then retest for a support level wouldnt be bad 7:43 PM · Jul 11, 2025 11 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter According to the analyst, a pullback and retest of support around $113,000 would be healthy for the structure of the rally before any further upside. Looking at the Binance BTC/USDT 24-hour Liquidation Heatmap, the current market structure appears to support CryptoOrca’s view of a short-term cooldown. Binance BTC/USDT 24-hour Liquidation Heatmap. The heatmap reveals a concentration of liquidation clusters and leverage pockets between $111,000 and $113,000, indicating a strong zone of prior long interest and potential support. If Bitcoin experiences a pullback, this area is likely to act as a critical floor for the ongoing uptrend. The presence of dense yellow and green bands in this range suggests that many leveraged long positions were opened here. As a result, bulls will be incentivised to defend this level aggressively. A retest of this zone would not only reset overheated indicators but could also serve as a springboard for the next leg higher, potentially validating it as a new support base after the $100,000–$110,000 breakout. On the upside, the heatmap shows thinning liquidation density above the $118,000 mark, implying fewer short liquidations left to fuel a continued squeeze in the immediate term. This lack of short-side pressure could cap Bitcoin’s short-term upside around the psychological $120,000 level. Still, the long-term picture remains firmly bullish. As long as Bitcoin holds above the $111,000–$113,000 support band, momentum is expected to favour the further upside. Traders may look for high-conviction re-entry zones within this range before positioning for the next breakout phase. At press time, Bitcoin had some of its daily gains and was hovering around the $117,000 mark. Altcoin recap In the last 7 days, the altcoin market rose over 23% to reclaim the $1.52 trillion level, which it has not seen since early March. Analysts like Arthur Hayes think altcoin season could be on the horizon. Utility-focused cryptocurrencies such as Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), and Chainlink (LINK), all seen as strong ETF contenders, are expected to do well. But meme coins could end up gaining the most, just like they did in past bull runs. As of press time, Ethereum (ETH) was up 18% over the weekly period while XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and SUI (SUI) clocked gains ranging between 20-30%. MemeCore (M) was the highest gainer among the top 100 altcoins this week, soaring over 1,200% and pushing its market cap from $8 million to $1.36 billion at the time of writing. Mog Coin (MOG) and Story (IP), while not posting such explosive gains, also performed strongly with weekly increases of 82% and 45%, respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap MemeCore : MemeCore’s late-week rally was supported by a series of exchange listings, including Binance Alpha, Kraken, Bitget, BingX, HTX, and HashKey. Listings of this scale often trigger sharp moves for low-cap, newly launched tokens, a trend seen in previous bull cycles. MemeCore’s rally was further supported by a strategic partnership with market maker Klein Labs and a broader surge in market risk appetite following Bitcoin’s breakout to a new all-time high. Mog Coin : MOG’s price surged over the past week after it broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern, a chart setup in technical analysis that often signals a sharp move once the price escapes the narrowing range. The breakout drew in more investors who jumped in expecting further gains. The rally also benefited from the broader market recovery fuelled by Bitcoin’s new all-time highs, which reignited interest in the meme coin sector.

2025-07-12T09:57:49,"Upexi to to inject its Solana treasury with $200 million","Consumer products company Upexi has announced plans to bolster its Solana treasury. According to the update, the firm intends to raise $200 million to fund business operations as well as its further Solana purchases. The fund is expected to come from two separate financing vehicles, per the company’s statement. Upexi is a brand that specializes in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of consumer products, diversifying into the cryptocurrency industry. The company took to blogging platform X to announce how the funds would be raised. “Today we announced a blockbuster deal with a $150m in kind convertible note led by @BigBrainVC and a $50m equity private placement,” the firm said . Upexi also added that net proceeds will be used to purchase more Solana. Upexi set to raise $200 million to purchase SOL According to its statement, Upexi mentioned that the $150 million convertible note offering would be collateralized via locked, spot SOL provided by the purchasers of its convertible notes, which is expected to have a two-year maturity and a 2% interest rate that is payable every quarter. After the completion of the note offering, the tokens are expected to be added to the SOL treasury maintained by the company. The firm had previously announced its intention to build a digital assets treasury filled with Solana in April, raising $100 million to back its purchase at the time. The company said about 95% of the raised funds would be used to set up, fill, and operate its Solana-based treasury reserve, marking its diversification into the crypto space. Following the announcement, Upexi shares skyrocketed, finishing the day at $9.89, up by 335%. The share previously rose as high as 22%, marking its highest price in a year. With its latest purchase, Upexi will push its treasury balance to 1.65 million SOL worth around $270 million. With the firm holding such an amount of tokens, it now boasts twice the amount of Solana as another prominent, publicly traded Solana treasury, DeFi Development Corporation (DFDV). Shares of Upexi are yet to react as much as they did when the news of the first raise broke, with the stock only seeing a 7.8% rise to hit $5.39 after the announcement was made. The stock, UPXI, is down about 58% in the last month after its first jump, which saw it peak at $22.57, according to data from Google Finance. Nevertheless, the shares are still up by 53% year-to-date. Solana is also on the rise, with the asset trading at $162.47, a drop of 0.92% in the past day. SOL experienced a price rise on Friday, with Bitcoin also hitting a new all-time high at the same time. Meanwhile, Grayscale has called out the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for pausing the debut of its exchange-traded funds that hold several assets including Solana. The company alleged that its investors are suffering harm as a result of the SEC’s decision. The company asked the SEC to allow its Digital Large Cap Fund to begin trading.

2025-07-12T09:57:15,"Crypto Bull Run Gains Momentum, Here’s When Altcoin Season Might Start","The post Crypto Bull Run Gains Momentum, Here’s When Altcoin Season Might Start appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has officially broken past the $118,000 mark, hitting a new all-time high. Crypto analyst Virtual Bacon believes this is the beginning of a major bull cycle. However, he warns that altseason has not yet arrived. Here’s what’s happening, what to watch for, and why investors should stay patient. Bitcoin Bull Run Over the last seven days, Bitcoin has climbed 8.8%. So far this month, the price has jumped nearly 10%, touching a new all-time high of $118,000 . Virtual Bacon considers this breakout a major bullish signal and believes it marks the start of a new bull market. He points out that Bitcoin typically leads during early bull phases, with altcoins following once liquidity shifts. “Bitcoin’s breakout confirms the beginning of a new cycle,” he wrote on X . Bitcoin’s current support levels: 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA): $86,982 20-week SMA: $96,719 (a proven dip-buying zone) Altcoin Season Is Close, But Not Confirmed Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.58%, down from 65.50% on July 1. While this slight drop is a good sign, altseason typically begins after a sustained fall in BTC dominance. Virtual Bacon points out early indicators: E thereum’ s price against BTC has jumped 10.53% this month ETH/BTC now trades at 0.02516, up from 0.02276 A strong weekly close above 0.024 could signal a true breakout From July 5 to 10, ETH/BTC surged by 9.49%, although it saw a minor correction of 1.08% afterward. The strength in ETH and SOL is encouraging, but not yet a confirmation of full altcoin rotation. Fed Quietly Injecting Liquidity into Markets A major factor supporting the crypto rally is the Federal Reserve’s quiet liquidity injection. Virtual Bacon outlines two major moves: $11 billion repo injection on June 30 A proposal to reduce the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) for large banks. These actions boost bank reserves and allow for more lending, which increases liquidity in the broader financial system. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : BitcoinTalk User Turns $500 to $10M After Unlocking 2012 Bitcoin Bar , Additionally, the Global Liquidity Index is making a higher low. If it breaks above its April and September 2024 highs, it could confirm expanding liquidity—another condition needed for altseason. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 17. Reports suggest there is a 64% chance of a rate cut in Q4 2025, which could further fuel crypto momentum. Final Thoughts: Wait for Confirmation Before Diving Into Altcoins While Bitcoin’s breakout is undeniable and the early signs for altcoins are positive, Virtual Bacon advises caution. A confirmed altseason requires: Sustained BTC dominance drop Breakout in ETH/BTC Full expansion in global liquidity Investors are advised to avoid jumping into low-cap altcoins prematurely. Instead, focus on large-cap coins showing early strength and wait for more macro confirmation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As of press time on July 12, XRP’s market capitalization stood at $163.98 billion, up from $131.41 billion a week earlier, an increase of about $32.57 billion. Notably, XRP peaked at $171.88 billion on July 11. XRP one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap This momentum has also lifted XRP’s price, which is now testing the $3 resistance zone. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $2.77, up nearly 25% over the last seven days and more than 7% on the daily chart. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Why XRP is rallying XRP’s rally has been fueled by its ability to track broader market sentiment, which has seen Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high above $118,000. Technically, XRP’s break above the $2.30 resistance level helped unlock further capital inflows. At the same time, on-chain data from analytics platform Santiment shared on July 11 shows that with XRP approaching $3, market interest has picked up notably. For example, 6,939 new XRP wallets were created in a single day, the highest daily figure since March 1. Additionally, social media activity has also spiked, with XRP now featuring in over 5.5% of all cryptocurrency-related discussions, a level last seen on March 18. XRP network activity chart. Source: Santiment XRP fundamentals Beyond technical drivers, institutional developments have buoyed sentiment. For instance, Ripple’s stablecoin , RLUSD, is seeing increased adoption in cross-border remittances, highlighted by Visa’s partnership with Yellow Card to facilitate settlements in Africa. In addition, XRP’s momentum has been supported by growing anticipation of a potential resolution in the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), with signs the two parties are moving closer to a settlement. Speculation around the possible approval of an XRP spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) has further fueled interest, as institutional investors eye the asset’s potential.

While most countries now impose strict regulations and high tax rates, a few nations still offer zero-tax regimes, making them global hubs for crypto startups, traders, and digital nomads. Here’s a look at the top crypto tax-free countries in 2025 and the worst countries to trade crypto if you want to hold on to your profits. Best Tax-Free Crypto Countries in 2025 Country Crypto Tax Rate / Status Cayman Islands 0% (No income, capital gains, or corporate tax) United Arab Emirates 0% (Tax-free on trading, staking, mining) El Salvador 0% (No capital gains or income tax on Bitcoin) Germany 0% (If held for over 12 months) Singapore 0% (Capital gains tax exempt) Malaysia 0% (Occasional trading only) Bermuda 0% (No income or capital gains tax) Belarus 0% (No income or capital gains tax) Malta 0% (Long-term gains only; corporate tax may apply) Cayman Islands The Cayman Islands is widely considered a crypto tax haven.

United Arab Emirates The UAE has emerged as a top crypto-friendly country. Crypto trading, staking, mining, and NFT transactions are all tax-free . Although tax policies can vary across emirates, the overall regulatory environment is clear and pro-crypto. El Salvador Under its Digital Assets Law, El Salvador imposes zero capital gains and income tax on Bitcoin transactions . The government-backed Chivo wallet and the planned “Bitcoin City” add to its appeal for crypto investors and miners. Germany While not fully tax-free, Germany allows tax-free crypto sales after a 12-month holding period . If you hold Bitcoin or other digital assets for a year or more, you pay no tax when you sell, swap, or spend them. Singapore Singapore has no capital gains tax, making crypto trading and selling tax-free for most investors. However, if you earn crypto as payment for goods or services, it may be subject to income tax. Malaysia Malaysia does not impose capital gains tax, so occasional crypto trading is tax-free . However, frequent traders may be treated as professionals and taxed under income tax laws. Bermuda Bermuda offers a zero percent tax rate on crypto income, capital gains, and investment returns. It remains a top choice for crypto investors and businesses seeking regulatory clarity. Belarus Belarus has legalized crypto and offers no income or capital gains tax on crypto transactions for individuals and businesses. The government is actively supporting blockchain innovation. Malta Malta is known for its crypto-friendly laws. No tax is applied on long-term gains if crypto is used as a store of value. However, frequent trading can be taxed under business income laws, with corporate tax rates up to 35%. Some entities may reduce this to as low as 5% depending on structure. Worst Countries for Crypto Taxes in 2025 Country Crypto Tax Rate India 30% capital gains + 1% TDS Spain Up to 47% on income, 28% on gains Netherlands 32% tax on presumed gains Denmark 40% personal income tax South Africa Up to 18% capital gains + 45% income tax India India has imposed a flat 30% capital gains tax on all crypto earnings and a 1% TDS on transactions.

Netherlands The Netherlands applies a 32% tax on presumed gains , even if crypto assets aren’t sold. This applies to digital asset portfolios exceeding €300,000, regardless of trading activity. Denmark Denmark imposes a 40% personal income tax on crypto gains . Loss offsets are limited—only 30% of losses can be deducted from taxable gains. South Africa Crypto in South Africa is subject to 18% capital gains tax and up to 45% income tax . Lack of clear guidance on DeFi, airdrops, or forks adds confusion for users and businesses. Countries That Banned Crypto but Have No Tax Policy These countries have no crypto tax laws , not because they’re tax havens, but because crypto is banned or heavily restricted : China Egypt Bangladesh Algeria Iraq Ethiopia Crypto use is not legally allowed in these nations, so tax rules are irrelevant. Conclusion In 2025, a growing number of countries are tightening their grip on cryptocurrency taxation. Yet, a few crypto-friendly countries continue to offer tax-free regimes, attracting serious investors and major Web3 firms.

2025-07-12T09:15:50,"Will Bitcoin and AVAX Dominate Q3, or Will Retail Rotate to Meme Favorites Like Dogecoin?","The opening days of Q3 feel like the start of a boxing match: Bitcoin in one corner, institutional capital behind it; Avalanche (AVAX) in another, promising faster settlements; and a rowdy crowd of meme coins, spearheaded by Dogecoin, taunting both heavyweights from the ringside. Analysts ask whether blue-chip names will keep control or if retail traders will again sprint toward lighter, wilder tokens. Into this clash steps MAGACOIN FINANCE, an up-and-coming political meme coin that claims it can marry narrative flair with solid fundamentals. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Steal the Spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE is an early-stage memecoin project backed by strong fundamentals and a viral community. On-chain trackers show a clear rise in unique wallets and a jump in average holding size as the project heads into Stage 3 of its presale, evidence that accumulation is replacing quick flips. Unlike many meme tokens, MAGACOIN backs its buzz with structure. The supply is permanently capped at 170 billion coins, a guardrail meant to avoid the dilution that haunts older memes. Governance remains venture-capital-free, so every material change rises and falls on community votes without risk of selling pressure due to VC unlocks. That bottom-up governance model reflects the coin’s political brand and has become a talking point in analyst notes that compare MAGACOIN’s cultural pull to Dogecoin’s early years. Bitcoin’s High-Pressure Summer Standard Chartered’s desk sees Bitcoin pressing toward $135,000 by late quarter, driven by ETF inflows and a fading dollar. Although other analysts caution that historical mid-year slumps and fresh geopolitical jitters could still derail the charge, the broader uptrend remains intact. If Bitcoin does push past the psychological $110,000 mark, past cycles suggest retail liquidity eventually trickles down the ladder, often igniting meme rallies a few weeks later. That timing matters to traders, whether to sit in the heavyweight champion or front-run the next rotation. Avalanche Looks for Its Cue Avalanche spent June around $17, with chart analysts flagging a potential breakout above $20 as a gateway to a steeper climb. Medium-term projections peg a $30–$35 band, which is plausible in early Q3 if ecosystem growth holds pace. Still, some research desks note that “smart money” has begun inching toward higher-beta plays in DeFi spin-offs, suggesting that AVAX may need fresh catalysts to keep attention once meme season revs up. Dogecoin and the Retail Pulse Dogecoin rarely stays silent for long. Although it is down more than 40% this year, experts still believe the original meme coin can have some quick turnaround with increased liquidity and spill-over energy from Bitcoin highs. History shows that liquidity splinters into newer memes within days whenever DOGE catches a bid, and there are already signs of large wallets reallocating away from DOGE toward “next-gen” meme plays with clearer narratives and tighter tokenomics. A Three-Way Tug-of-War Put side by side, Bitcoin offers perceived safety and a shot at a historic milestone. Avalanche AVAX provides a technological story and mid-cap upside, and Dogecoin and its meme entourage promise adrenaline. MAGACOIN FINANCE tries to fold parts of each recipe into one dish: the resonance of a cultural storyline, the discipline of a capped supply, and the practicality of zero transaction fees. If Bitcoin rallies first, as many expect, meme coins typically follow. Should that pattern repeat, a community-driven token with audit credentials might be the one that grabs the microphone when retail enthusiasm peaks. Did I hear someone say MAGACOIN Finance? Yes, that’s the token to eye!

2025-07-12T09:15:48,"AI Predicts When XRP Will Trade at $10","Google’s advanced AI model, Gemini, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over XRP’s price trajectory, offering a data-driven prediction that is already attracting attention. With XRP showing notable gains over the past week and Bitcoin’s exceptional year-to-date performance reinforcing bullish sentiment in the market, Gemini’s forecast comes at a time of growing optimism for the digital asset. Analysts are closely watching the interplay of market dynamics, regulatory shifts, and investor confidence, which together seem to be setting the stage for further appreciation. Recent Market Performance Points to Strength XRP is currently trading at $2.77, reflecting a 7% increase in the past 24 hours and a 24% gain over the past seven days. These moves mirror broader market strength, particularly evident in Bitcoin’s performance. Over the last year, Bitcoin has surged by more than 106%, rising from $57,000 to $177,800, and has climbed an additional 9% in just the last week. This sustained momentum in Bitcoin often trickles down to altcoins, historically lifting XRP and other assets during bullish market cycles. Many observers believe that continued strength in Bitcoin could create favorable conditions for XRP to test higher levels. Another factor underpinning this renewed optimism is the resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit, which had clouded XRP’s regulatory status for years, concluded favorably for Ripple, easing investor concerns about potential enforcement risks. This development has been widely viewed as removing a major overhang on XRP’s price. Regulatory Climate Has Improved In addition to the lawsuit’s resolution, a recent analysis published in the Securing the Rights of Cryptocreditors journal highlighted the shifting regulatory environment as a critical element in XRP’s resurgence. The journal observed that “the change in the U.S. administration has paved the way for XRP to continue to increase in value,” citing a more crypto-friendly approach under President Trump’s administration and an overall recalibration of regulatory priorities. This shift has helped alleviate some of the pressure that had previously restrained XRP, allowing the market to reassess its long-term potential without the same degree of regulatory uncertainty. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Gemini’s $10 Prediction by December Against this backdrop of improved fundamentals and sentiment, Google Gemini’s AI-generated forecast provides a clear target for investors. According to Gemini, XRP is expected to trade at $10 by December. The AI model’s analysis incorporates current price momentum, the bullish environment in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, and the easing of regulatory risks as significant drivers of price appreciation over the coming months. “Based on technical indicators and market trend analysis, XRP has the potential to reach $10 by the end of this year,” Gemini’s forecast states. This projection represents a significant increase from current levels, but it aligns with the prevailing optimism among market participants who view XRP as undervalued relative to its utility and market position. As market conditions evolve, investors will continue to monitor how well XRP can sustain its upward trajectory and whether the factors identified by Google Gemini and other analysts will materialize as expected. For now, the combination of strong technical performance, improved regulatory clarity , and bullish sentiment appears to support the view that XRP’s upward momentum could carry it toward the $10 mark in the months ahead.

2025-07-12T09:15:34,"Bitcoin Could Explode by 112% Before End of Year, According to Analyst Michaël van de Poppe – But There’s a Catch","Analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) is primed to go much higher after the flagship crypto asset broke into a new all-time high. Van de Poppe tells his 795,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could reach a price of $250,000 in the fourth quarter – an increase of around 112% from the current level. According to the widely followed analyst, Bitcoin could hit a price of $125,000 this month and $150,000 between July and the end of September. However, Van de Poppe expects the rally to pause before his targets can be reached. “Probably going to stall for a little before we’ll continue.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading at $117,915 at time of writing, up by around 10% over the past week. Turning to Ethereum ( ETH ), the widely followed analyst says the second-largest crypto asset by market cap appears bullish and could rise to levels last witnessed in November of 2021. “A vertical candle upwards. Now, some patience and then we’ll continue to the all-time highs.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Ethereum is trading at $2,980 at time of writing, up by nearly 20% over the past seven days but down by approximately 40% from the all-time high reached close to four years ago. Lastly, Van de Poppe believes that the downtrend in the total market capitalization of altcoins versus Bitcoin is about to reverse . The widely followed analyst says altcoins are forming a bullish divergence against Bitcoin on the weekly time frame – an indication that altcoins are bottoming out against the flagship crypto asset. A bullish divergence occurs when the price of an asset is forming lower lows while an oscillator like the relative strength index (RSI) is forming higher highs.

2025-07-12T08:52:38,"Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Leads the Charge Above $3,000 – Has Crypto Summer Season Officially Begun?","Ethereum (ETH) briefly touched $3,000 this weekend, and the market is feeling optimistic again. Currently at $2,969, ETH is showing a sustained breakout with high volume and bullish indicators. After weeks of steady gains, Crypto Summer may have finally arrived. ETH lost 0.41% in early weekend trading, but the trend is still intact. ETH is up 9% in the last 5 days and outperforming most altcoins. This is more than a short term spike, it’s institutional demand and growing confidence in Ethereum’s long term. SharpLink’s ETH Buy is Institutional Trust A big catalyst for this momentum is the $25.72 million private OTC deal between the Ethereum Foundation and Nasdaq listed SharpLink Gaming. The esports marketing firm bought 10,000 ETH at $2,572 per token, now holds 215,957 ETH worth over $600 million. SharpLink has acquired 10,000 $ETH directly from the ethereum foundation. They are now holding 215,000+ $ETH . pic.twitter.com/tQh94jUbXS — Satoshi Stacker (@StackerSatoshi) July 11, 2025 SharpLink’s CEO Joseph Lubin said the purchase is part of the company’s long term strategy, not speculative trading. The Ethereum Foundation said the OTC route was chosen to avoid market disruption, open market sales can be heavy on the price. Deal Size: 10,000 ETH for $25.72M Average Purchase Price: $2,572 Current Holding Value: Over $600M Market Reaction: SharpLink stock up 17% So institutional confidence is high and ETH is above $3,000 without profit taking. Investors see this as a vote of long term confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its utility across Web3, DeFi and tokenization. ETF Inflows Mean Strong Demand Ahead To top it off, U.S. spot ETH ETFs saw their second-largest daily inflow of $383.1 million at the end of last week. Total 5-day inflow is $851.73 million, and total inflows are over $5 billion ahead of their 1-year anniversary on July 23. BlackRock’s ETHA drew in $300.93 million in one day. The biggest $ETH ETF inflow in history just hit: $383M in a day. $12.5B now parked in Ethereum. Institutions are front-running the next leg. Still sidelined? You’re gonna feel it at $10,000. pic.twitter.com/eXiSvP20rP — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) July 12, 2025 These ETFs are not only absorbing supply but also helping ETH find price stability in a volatile market. Since Ethereum’s 2022 proof-of-stake transition, supply has been dwindling. Over the last nine trading days, ETF inflows have outpaced ETH supply, creating a supply squeeze. With crypto conferences and ETF milestones in July, many see this as the start of Ethereum’s next leg up. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Technical and Trade From a charting perspective, Ethereum price prediction seems bullish as it has broken out of an ascending channel since March. Daily RSI is at 72, indicating strong momentum but overbought conditions. No reversal candles yet, bulls are in control. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Ethereum Trade Outlook Entry: $2,864 (pullback zone) Stop-Loss: Below $2,700 (mid channel support) Targets: $3,126 (resistance), then $3,432 (channel top) A bullish engulfing or hammer candle at support would be additional confirmation for dip buyers. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $2 million in its public presale, with $2,511,140 out of a $2,846,221 target. The token is priced at $0.012225, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction.

2025-07-12T08:50:07,"Why Pi Network Coin Price is Dropping","The post Why Pi Network Coin Price is Dropping appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network Coin holders are feeling the heat as token price drops by 9% while the entire crypto market enjoys strong gains. While Bitcoin has smashed a new all-time high, Pi Coin keeps slipping closer to its all-time low $0.40. Many are now wondering why the Pi network coin price is dropping. Pi Network Coin Drops 9% In the past 24 hours alone, Pi Coin has dropped about 9% and now trades near $0.471, not far from its lowest level ever, $0.40. This looks worse when you compare it to the rest of the crypto market, which is all green. Bitcoin is above $118,000 and Ethereum crossed $3,000, but Pi keeps moving the other way. Even the recent Pi2Day celebration , which was supposed to boost excitement in the Pi community, couldn’t lift the price. Over the last two weeks, Pi has fallen more than 29%, showing just how deep this downtrend has become. Token Unlock Adds More Pressure One big reason behind Pi’s continued slide is the massive token unlock happening this July. Between July 8 and July 15, over 100 million PI tokens about 1.5% of the total supply will hit the market. On one day alone, 10.1 million tokens will be unlocked. These unlocked tokens often end up being sold by big holders, which adds extra selling pressure when there aren’t enough buyers to balance it out. Many whales are taking profits by selling, and that weighs heavily on the price. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Bull Run Gains Momentum, Here’s When Altcoin Season Might Start , Pi Technicals Still Look Weak The technical side isn’t offering much comfort either. Pi Coin is trading inside a clear downward channel. Each time it tries to break higher, sellers push it back down. The trading volume is also low at $19.95 million, which shows that buyers don’t have enough strength to flip the trend just yet. However, Pi Network RSI has also reflected a bearish sentiment as it is currently at 39.8 reflecting an over-sold. What’s Next for Pi Coin? For now, the risks look bigger than the chances of a sudden turnaround. With so many tokens unlocking and big holders ready to sell, Pi could easily slip back to test the $0.40 zone or even drop into the $0.35 or $0.38 range if things get worse. Until Pi sees stronger buying interest, emergency liquidity, or a big exchange listing, the price may stay stuck in this bearish phase. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Large token unlocks, like the 100+ million PI tokens being released in July, typically increase the circulating supply. This creates selling pressure as holders take profits, weighing down the price due to insufficient buying demand. What is the short-term outlook for Pi Coin’s price? The risks outweigh chances of a sudden turnaround. Pi Coin could test the $0.40 zone or even drop to $0.35-$0.38 due to ongoing token unlocks and selling pressure, unless strong buying interest or a major listing emerges. Is Pi coin a good investment? If the bullish sentiment sustains, the PI value could reach as high as $2.1007 this year.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-pi-network-coin-price-is-dropping/,"TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T08:47:32,"XLM Explodes by 22% Followed by XRP, BTC Price Calms at $118K: Weekend Watch","Bitcoin’s spectacular end to the business week, in which the asset gained over ten grand and skyrocketed to a new all-time high, has finally reached an exhaustion point as the asset has calmed at $118,000. Several altcoins have followed suit, while XRP, CRO, and especially XLM have charted mindblowing gains. BTC’s Rally It’s been a while since we have said this, but a lot can change in the cryptocurrency markets in the span of a few days. Recall that itcoin’s price stood within a tight range between $105,000 and $110,000 for a few weeks, and each breakout attempt in both directions was stopped in its tracks. However, that all came to an end on Wednesday evening when the asset finally broke out of the upper boundary and shot up to a new all-time high of $112,000. After a brief retracement, the cryptocurrency began an even more impressive rally that resulted in tapping $116,000 on Thursday evening, but BTC went all the way up to almost $119,000 on Friday morning. Although it has lost some traction since then and now trades just under $118,000, bitcoin has gained over 9% on a weekly scale. Its market capitalization has grown to $2.345 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has declined slightly to 62.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XLM Steals the Show Most altcoins posted mindblowing gains over the past few days as well, but have calmed since yesterday. Ethereum, for instance, went from $2,500 to over $3,000 to market a five-month peak before it corrected slightly to just under the latter. In contrast, XRP was a little sluggish at first but took the spotlight yesterday by surging to almost $3. Although it has dropped below $2.8 now, it’s still 7% up on the day, and it overtook USDT in terms of market cap. CRO has charted a similar price surge over the past day, taking it to well over $0.1. However, the day belongs to XLM, which has exploded by more than 22% and now trades above $0.37. Pi Network’s native token, on the other hand, has plunged by over 6% and struggles to remain above $0.47. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets gained over $300 billion since Wednesday and stands at $3.750 trillion on CG now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-12T08:27:11,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: The Dollar’s Dip, BTC’s Rise – Is $300,000 Within Reach This Year?","Bitcoin is holding at $117,761, up 8% this week, while the US dollar is looking tired. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against major currencies, closed at 94.73, just above recent lows and down 10.4% from its 2022 high. The dollar’s weakness is driving capital into digital assets as investors seek alternatives to traditional stores of value. Dollar Index Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The technicals are strong . Bitcoin has broken out of a symmetrical triangle and cleared the 0.382 and 0.5 Fibonacci retracement levels. Price is consolidating above $116,951—a key support zone. The 50-period SMA on the 4-hour chart is at $110,527 below and supporting the trend. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators back the bull case. The RSI is at 75.5—overbought but not diverging—so until a bearish candle or volume drop shows up, the path of least resistance is up. #Bitcoin holds firm above $117K after breakout. RSI at 75 shows strong momentum 0.5 Fib ($116,951) acting as key support 50-SMA rising at $110,527 Potential Targets: $121.3K, $124.6K, $127.6K Watch for Doji/spinning top near resistance #BTC #Crypto #TradingView pic.twitter.com/UscsoGCIDz — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) July 12, 2025 Macro Forces Align: Fed Uncertainty, ETF Hopes The Fed is deeply divided on rates, and the dollar is in limbo. Some want to wait, others see inflation risks that require more tightening. Markets are pricing in a 50% chance of a July rate cut—a coin flip that keeps traders on edge. In crypto, the picture is clearer. ETF hopes are building despite the SEC delaying Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF. Analysts think more crypto ETFs are coming as institutions start to treat Bitcoin like digital gold. This narrative makes BTC a better hedge against rate changes and geopolitical risk. Meanwhile, Peter Schiff is telling everyone to sell Bitcoin for silver and the market is ignoring him. BTC is up 6% after his warning and many are citing institutional inflows and strong technicals as reasons to stay long. Trade Setup and Risks to Watch Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, therefore, for a continuation trade, here’s a setup: Entry: Pullback to $116,950 (0.5 Fib) Stop-Loss: Below $112,500 (0.382) Targets: $121,378 (0.618), $124,682, $127,681 This is a Fibonacci confluence and trend play. Look for reversal signs—spinning top or Doji—at resistance levels. But risks remain. The July 12 Fed minutes could be volatile if the tone turns hawkish. And the US government’s tariff policies—especially towards BRICS countries like South Africa—will impact global risk sentiment and crypto indirectly. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s technical breakout, a weak dollar, and growing ETF hopes mean more upside could be ahead. Whether BTC gets to $300,000 this year is a confluence of events—Fed policy, institutional adoption, and macro volatility. But for now, bulls are in control.
