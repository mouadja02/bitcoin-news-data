2025-07-12T01:30:36,"Ripple Concludes Pilot In Kenya Using RLUSD","The first field deployment of Ripple’s US-dollar stablecoin, RLUSD, as a drought-insurance rail has wrapped up in Laikipia North, Kenya. According to an update from Ripple Impact, the four-month “anticipatory aid” experiment insured 517 pastoralists—roughly 70 percent of them women—against feed shortages that typically emerge after the long-rains season. Ripple Tests RLUSD in Kenya Aid Pilot Ripple disclosed the outcome in a post on X: “The Ripple Impact drought insurance pilot in Kenya concluded, successfully insuring 517 pastoralists (70% women) using RLUSD . Satellite data showed favorable vegetation during the pilot period, so no payout was triggered. This unused RLUSD rolls into the next pilot phase…” Built in partnership with Mercy Corps Ventures and DeFi aid platform DIVA Donate, the scheme escrowed donations in RLUSD on Ethereum and released them only if satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) readings fell below a calibrated threshold of 0.55. During the March-to-June observation window vegetation remained above 0.61, so smart contracts never unlocked the funds—precisely the outcome expected in a non-drought year. Because no trigger was hit, the full RLUSD pool now carries forward for the short-rains dry spell that begins in October. DIVA Donate says the next phase will widen the cohort to 533 herder households and aims to raise $40,000, augmented by about $12,000 in unspent capital from earlier Mercy Corps Ventures and Arbitrum -backed campaigns. For Ripple, the pilot doubles as a real-world stress test of RLUSD’s programmability. Launched in late 2024 on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, the stablecoin crossed the $500 million circulation mark this week and secured Bank of New York Mellon as primary reserve custodian, underscoring a compliance-first positioning in an increasingly competitive stable-asset sector. Humanitarian technologists have long argued that pre-disaster cash beats post-disaster relief; the Laikipia experiment adds a cryptographic audit trail and automatic execution layer to that logic. By chaining disbursements to open-source oracles, donors can verify that money is held—and, when nature cooperates, preserved—exactly as promised. If October’s NDVI readings break below the floor, RLUSD will move straight to pastoralists’ mobile wallets without an intermediary in sight. Whether the model scales will depend on satellite accuracy, mobile-money liquidity and stablecoin regulatory latitude in East Africa. For now, proponents regard the zero-payout result not as a dud but as statistical validation: in a season of healthy pasture, insurance is supposed to sit idle—while quietly extending its safety net into the next risk cycle.

2025-07-12T01:00:11,"Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800—Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap?","Bitcoin’s summer rally accelerated in the early hours of 11 July, when the benchmark cryptocurrency sliced through $118,000 and printed exchange highs that peaked above $118,800, depending on venue data. The spike wiped out an estimated $1.25 billion in short positions within a single trading day, according to CoinGlass figures. Bitcoin Bull Trap Or Breakout? Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards took to X as the breakout unfolded. “New all-time highs beget new ATHs. It’s usually unwise to ignore a major breakout like this, until invalidated,” he wrote, adding that corporate treasury demand has “grown exponentially, with dozens of new companies popping up in recent months.” Edwards’ base-case projection calls for a further 50–70 percent advance over the next six months—roughly $170,000–$196,000. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY—If Treasury Firms Hold His focus on treasuries is backed by hard data. Public companies added a record 159,107 BTC in Q2—pushing aggregate corporate holdings above 847,000 BTC, or about four percent of max supply. Corporate Bitcoin acquisitions have even outpaced ETF net inflows. Matthew Sigel, head of digital-asset research at VanEck, framed Bitcoin’s trajectory within a broader macro and policy backdrop. “The natural course for Bitcoin remains higher, driven by persistent US debt and deficit problems, demographic tailwinds, a weakening dollar, growing momentum around Fed rate cuts, and the potential for a new Fed chair next year,” he wrote on X. Sigel also highlighted Capitol Hill’s looming “Crypto Week,” where stablecoin legislation is widely viewed as the most passable of several digital-asset bills. Those developments, he argues, make $180,000 “very much in play for 2025.” Law-makers appear to share the sense of urgency. A press statement from the House Financial Services Committee confirms that the week of 14 July will be dedicated to advancing the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the GENIUS Act. Passage would establish the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins and market structure, a change Sigel says could “unlock wide-open capital markets” for the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns Spot Bitcoin ETFs are hardly idle: net inflows into BlackRock’s iShares fund alone have pushed its holdings past 700,000 BTC in the 18 months since launch. Yet Edwards and Sigel both note that treasury companies have become the marginal buyer in 2025. The dynamic creates what Edwards calls a “cap-raising flywheel,” as firms showcase outperforming share prices—up nearly 60 percent year-to-date for the treasury cohort—when courting investors. Notably, the rally is unfolding against a supportive macro backdrop. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller told a Dallas Fed audience he is “open to cutting the policy rate in July,” arguing current settings are “too tight” given waning inflation pressures. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Fed chair Jerome Powell over the past weeks, demanding immediate rate cuts. Trump’s tariff escalation also seems to fade out, supporting the Bitcoin rally. Notwithstanding euphoric headlines, technicians warn that momentum must sustain above $110,000 to avoid a failed-breakout pattern. “This theory would be weakened with closes below $110K and invalidated below $105K,” Edwards concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $117,854.

2025-07-12T00:48:05,"Robert Kiyosaki warns of banana zone FOMO as BTC eyes $124K","Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has issued a stark warning to crypto investors worldwide. On X, he warned that Bitcoin’s most recent surge put the cryptocurrency in what he described as the “ Banana Zone ,” ripe for potentially damaging emotional decision making based on FOMO, the fear of missing out. Bitcoin recently jumped above $117,000, a new record peak, igniting speculation it could surge as high as $124,000 or higher. Kiyosaki has a great answer to the run-up: Don’t go by emotion but strategy. “Be a smarter investor,” he said, noting that impulsive purchasing during euphoric market cycles is often associated with crippling losses. “Don’t be a HOG. HOGs get slaughtered. Be a PIG instead. PIGs get fat.” He shared that his buys were at $110,000, indicating conviction that we are long-term bullish, and cautioned against diving into the market at the top for no particular reason. His strategy? Wait for the market to correct, then buy back at a discount. Traders fuel fear and greed in banana zone rally Real Vision CEO and macro investor Raoul Pal is credited with popularizing the “Banana Zone”. It refers to a phase of rapid, nearly vertical price growth typically limited to high-demand, low-supply assets such as Bitcoin. Kiyosaki expressed a similar sentiment to Pal, stating that the “limited” nature of Bitcoin means that when there is an appetite for the coin, thereby driving up its interest, it faces a ton of upward pressure due to its scarcity. This cycle is usually driven by institutional adoption, media frenzy, and retail investor frenzy. It delivers the possibility of explosive gains but also introduces volatility, extreme risk, and emotional trading. As with previous surges, the current burst of optimism could lead to a short-lived price spike and some real downside risk, Kiyosaki said. He cautioned that many fresh investors are diving into the markets without understanding how fickle a game trading cryptocurrency can be. This flood of FOMO-driven buyers, he said, could add significant instability to the market. He said that as the price only goes up, inexperienced investors could become panicky, resulting in a “slaughtering” of those who bought in at these levels. In Kiyosaki’s view, this stage sees many investors piling in without doing any independent research, hoping for a quick buck. This “herd instinct” frequently results in excessive buying at the peak, with mass panic selling when the price “falls off a cliff”. He said investors should focus on educating themselves instead of chasing price surges while maintaining discipline. He cautioned that this was not the time to follow the crowd blindly, but rather an opportunity to sharpen their thinking. Traders push Bitcoin higher as risk escalates Bitcoin’s climb to $118,000 has bulls and analysts cheering. Some in the market believe the asset is in the early stages of a long-term bull run. Estimates of $124,000 or more are already being labeled conservative by certain circles. The more aggressive forecasters call for $250,000 by the end of 2025, and even $1 million by 2030 — particularly if macroeconomic travails continue to erode faith in fiat currencies. Kiyosaki, an ardent critic of central bank control over global monetary policy and fiat currency systems, believes Bitcoin is “people’s money” and that the flagship cryptocurrency presents a strong hedge against inflation. He’s sung Bitcoin’s praises for its fixed supply and decentralized nature multiple times. In June 2024, he repeated his faith in Raoul Pal’s Banana Zone theory and became a legendary figure of the upcoming bull market. He says he bought his first Bitcoin when the price was $6,000. Those early decisions have more than paid off, and he emphasizes that gains did so because he was investing smart and patiently, not gambling on hype.

A Wells Fargo customer for nearly four decades says the lender refused to make him whole after scammers drained $20,000 from his account. Scott Merovitch says he received a call from someone claiming to work at the bank, warning his account was flashing suspicious activity, reports FOX 26 Houston. According to Merovitch, the caller was able to provide information about his recent transactions. After the call, a woman pretending to work at Wells Fargo showed up at Merovitch’s front door, asked for his card and cut it into pieces. Two hours later, Merovitch says $20,000 exited his account at ATM locations just a few miles from his residence. When he filed for a reimbursement claim, Merovitch says the lender issued a letter telling him that the transactions were made by him or someone who had his permission. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase is refusing to reimburse a man scammed by a fake Apple support text, reports the CBS-affiliated news station KOLD. The phishing text, posing as Apple’s billing department, claimed unauthorized activity was underway. The victim says he quickly called the number, and the scammer likely installed malware on his iPhone to tap into his bank account. Chase says reimbursement is not happening. “After further review, our claim denial stands as we found these transactions were authorized by the customer with no evidence of fraudulent account takeover or of a compromised device.” Lastly, Bank of America refused to reimburse a customer who lost $450 to a taxi scam in Panama. Keith Lee says he was charged $450 for a $10 cab ride, according to the Elliott Report. The driver claimed Lee’s card didn’t process, so he paid cash. Bank of America denied his dispute, saying a chip-verified “card-present” transaction was executed. Consumer advocate Christopher Elliott then stepped in, contacting BofA on Lee’s behalf. After hearing from Elliott, Bank of America finally reversed the charge. Elliott says the bank acknowledged such taxi scams are well-known.

2025-07-12T00:00:47,"Ethereum Price Breaks Through 50EMA After Rejection, ETH Dominance Sees Resurgence","The Ethereum price is once again gaining momentum and looks set to reach new highs. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit commented on how the altcoin has broken through a crucial moving average (MA). Meanwhile, ETH’s dominance is again on the rise. Ethereum Price Breaks 50EMA On Weekly Chart In an X post, Doctor Profit stated that after 9 weeks of constant rejection at the EMA50 on the weekly chart, the Ethereum price has finally broken through. He claimed that it was a very good sign, as it suggests that ETH will reach higher targets in the coming weeks. The break above the 2,600 EMA50 level came as the broader crypto market rallied. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin In July, Is Altcoin Season Here? This rally has been led by the Bitcoin price, which has reached new all-time highs (ATHs). Based on this, the Ethereum price is expected to also reach new highs, with the yearly high of $3,600 already in sight. A reclaim of this level could also pave the way for ETH to reclaim the psychological $4,000 level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital alluded to the rising dominance of the Ethereum price. He noted that this ETH dominance fractal will not be a copy-paste version of what happened between 2019 and 2020. However, the analyst claimed that the recent rise to 10% of the dominance level shows that Ethereum wants to become more market-dominant in the coming months. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also believes that it is time for the Ethereum price to make its move. In an X post, he predicted that the altcoin could reach as high as $10,000 on this upward trend. He made this prediction while highlighting ETH’s chart against its BTC pair, suggesting that he also agrees that Ethereum’s dominance will rise in the coming months. ETH’s Move To Trigger Altcoin Season In an X post, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that the Ethereum price is following the Wyckoff re-accumulation schematic. He further remarked that this massive move will trigger altcoin season after ETH reaches the “SOS” level around $3,000. His accompanying chart also showed that he expects Ethereum to reach as high as $3,200 in the short term. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 As Analyst Calls It A ‘Powder Keg’ In another X post, Mikybull Crypto alluded to the fact that Bitcoin’s dominance was dumping even as the BTC price rises. The analyst remarked that this development means something, hinting at a potential altcoin season on the horizon. This is bullish for the Ethereum price and other altcoins as they would outperform BTC during this period. It is worth mentioning that Mikybull Crypto has also predicted that ETH can reach $10,000 in this market cycle. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,988, up over 7% according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-11T23:30:08,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised for 1,529% Surge as Bullish Momentum Builds Up","A prominent crypto analyst has projected that Shiba Inu (SHIB) could rise by more than 1,500%, stating that the current upward trend is still in its early stages. While much of the market’s attention remains on Bitcoin’s recent record highs , SHIB may be preparing for a major move of its own. According to crypto analyst MasterAnanda , Shiba Inu has not yet fully entered its bullish phase, positioning it as a potentially stronger play compared to assets that have already made significant gains. The analyst forecasts a rally that could erase another zero from SHIB’s price, taking it to previously unrecorded levels. SHIB Approaches a Potential Reversal After Prolonged Downtrend Shiba Inu’s price action over recent months has shown a consistent downtrend. Since its peak of $0.00004567 in March 2024, SHIB has experienced lower highs and lower lows, confirming a bearish structure. Following that peak, the token dropped to $0.00003074 and has remained within a descending triangle pattern ever since, with price action gravitating toward the lower boundary of the formation. However, recent market activity suggests that SHIB may be nearing a reversal. MasterAnanda pointed out that the token has posted a strong green weekly candle, indicating a possible shift in sentiment. Over the past week, SHIB has increased by approximately 19%, marking one of its strongest weekly performances since the first week of May, when it gained 25%. Despite the current price improvement, SHIB remains below the 200-day moving average (MA200), a key technical indicator used to determine overall trend direction. As long as the price remains under the MA200, which currently stands at $0.00001634, analysts generally view the broader trend as bearish. Breaking above this level would be a critical step in confirming sustained upward momentum. Analyst Targets Multiple Fibonacci Levels in 2025 Outlook MasterAnanda has outlined a set of potential price targets for Shiba Inu based on Fibonacci retracement and extension levels. The first target is $0.00003203, which corresponds to the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement level and would represent a breakout from the current triangle formation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If SHIB maintains its momentum, the next significant price levels are $0.00006767 (1.618 extension) and $0.0001032 (2.618 extension). The analyst regards $0.0001032 as the baseline for a new all-time high this cycle. Beyond that, the analysis includes further bullish targets: $0.0001743 and $0.000220491, which reflect the 3.618 and 4.618 Fibonacci extensions, respectively. These projections represent gains of approximately 1,183% and 1,529% from the current trading price of $0.00001360. Notably, this optimistic outlook aligns with previous assessments from other market commentators. Analyst Alan Santana previously suggested a similar potential breakout from SHIB’s descending triangle formation, reinforcing the view that substantial upside could still lie ahead for the meme-based token. While Shiba Inu has experienced a prolonged period of downward movement, current technical indicators and renewed market interest suggest a potential shift in trend. However, a confirmation above key resistance levels, particularly the 200-day moving average, remains essential before a sustained bullish trajectory can be validated.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. RICH Miner offers a new way to grow crypto assets, turning static holdings into stable daily income via cloud mining. In the cryptocurrency market, how to achieve continuous appreciation of the crypto assets in hand has become a common focus of investors. In the past, storing Bitcoin or XRP in a coin library or digital wallet was considered a safe option, but now, with the development of cloud mining technology, this static holding method is gradually being replaced by “dynamic appreciation”. The rise of RICH Miner is providing a new strategy for global users: no complicated operations are required, and crypto assets can be converted into stable daily income through cloud mining alone. You might also like: RICH Miner simplifies cloud mining with real-time passive returns Storage ≠ appreciation: The limitations of traditional coinbase strategies Many investors choose to store cryptocurrencies in centralized exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase or decentralized wallets, such as MetaMask, SafePal. This frozen asset method ensures security but lacks the ability to increase value. In a bull market, price increases may bring profits, but in a consolidation period or a bear market, assets not only cannot appreciate, but may even depreciate. Simple storage means missing the opportunity for active returns. The rise of cloud mining: a passive income tool that breaks the technical threshold Traditional mining used to be the patent of technology geeks and large mining farms.

2025-07-11T22:30:54,"Bitcoin Surge Pushes Satoshi Nakamoto Into Global Top 15 Rich List","The mysterious creator of Bitcoin (BTC), Satoshi Nakamoto, has climbed the global wealth rankings once again . Thanks to the coin’s sharp rise this week, Satoshi’s fortune has grown by billions of dollars. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham, the recent Bitcoin price rally has boosted the mysterious creator’s net worth. Satoshi Nakamoto is now reportedly richer than Amancio Ortega, the founder of fashion giant Zara. He is now ranked as the 12th richest person in the world. Bitcoin’s Price Rally Sends Nakamoto’s Net Worth Soaring On Thursday, July 10, the top coin reached a record high of $116,842, sparking even more excitement in the crypto market. By Friday, Bitcoin ‘s price climbed further to hit $118,909, a new all-time high. However, the market has pulled back slightly, now trading at $117,690, but up by 5.78% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data. This substantial rise followed a massive $1.18 billion inflow into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This marked the most significant single-day investment into the investment funds in 2025 so far. As a result of this surge, Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin stash, believed to be about 1.096 million BTC, grew significantly in value. In just 24 hours, the worth of these coins jumped by more than $8 billion. As of now, his holdings are valued at approximately $129.42 billion. Satoshi Nakamoto: One of the Richest, But Still Unknown Despite this staggering wealth, no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is. The individual or group behind the name has never revealed their identity. Even more intriguing, the Bitcoin linked to Satoshi has never been moved or spent since the cryptocurrency’s early days. His crypto wallets have remained dormant for over 15 years. This silence has fueled endless debate in the crypto world. Some believe Satoshi is gone, while others think he is choosing to stay hidden forever. His untouched fortune adds to the legend of Bitcoin’s creation. Many see it as a sign that Satoshi wanted the digital to be for the people, not for personal gain. Bitcoin’s Big Week The flagship crypto has seen one of its strongest weeks in 2025. Reportedly, it is on track for nearly a 10% weekly gain. The crypto market has responded strongly to rising demand, especially from institutional investors pouring money into Bitcoin ETFs. Recently, 10x Research analyst Markus Thielen said many traders haven’t bought enough Bitcoin after last month’s options expiry. He believes this could lead to a rally that pushes BTC up to $133,000 by September. As the crypto asset grows and gains mainstream acceptance, so too does the value of Satoshi Nakamoto’s hidden fortune.

2025-07-11T22:30:51,"Bitcoin Price Dominance: Decoding the Altcoin Lag and Future Crypto Market Rally","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing, but not in the way many might expect. While Bitcoin price has once again defied expectations, smashing through its previous all-time highs and setting new records, a curious phenomenon is unfolding across the broader market. Despite Bitcoin’s triumphant ascent, a significant portion of the altcoin market remains surprisingly subdued, exhibiting what many are calling a distinct altcoin lag . This unusual divergence raises crucial questions for investors and enthusiasts alike: Is this a sign of a healthier, more sustainable rally, or a precursor to further market shifts? Let’s delve into the data and unravel what this unique market dynamic truly signifies for the future of cryptocurrency trends . Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Phenomenon Bitcoin’s journey to a new all-time high has been nothing short of spectacular. This latest surge has cemented its position as the undisputed leader of the crypto realm. Data cited by The Kobeissi Letter, referencing Sentimentrader on X, highlights this dominance starkly: despite Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high, nearly 0% of other cryptocurrencies are trading within 5% of their respective 252-day highs. This statistic underscores a highly concentrated rally, where capital seems to be flowing almost exclusively into Bitcoin. What’s driving this singular focus on Bitcoin? Several factors are at play: Institutional Inflow: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large investment firms, pension funds, and wealth managers now have a regulated, accessible vehicle to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which was previously challenging. This influx of significant capital naturally prioritizes the most liquid and established asset. Halving Narrative: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, continues to be a powerful narrative. Historically, halvings have preceded major bull runs, creating anticipation and driving demand. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a ‘digital gold’ – a hedge against inflation and traditional financial instability. This perception attracts a broader range of investors seeking a safe haven. First-Mover Advantage: As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin possesses unparalleled brand recognition, network security, and liquidity, making it the primary choice for new capital entering the crypto space. The Curious Case of Altcoin Lag : Why Aren’t They Following? The stark contrast between Bitcoin’s stellar performance and the subdued state of altcoins is perplexing to many. In previous bull cycles, a Bitcoin rally typically served as a precursor, pulling the entire market upwards, with altcoins eventually experiencing even larger percentage gains. So, why the current altcoin lag ? The Sentimentrader statistic – almost zero altcoins within 5% of their 252-day highs – paints a clear picture of underperformance. Here are key reasons contributing to this divergence: Liquidity Concentration: The immense capital flowing into Bitcoin ETFs has absorbed a significant portion of the new money entering the crypto market. This means less liquidity is immediately available to trickle down into altcoins. Investors are opting for the most direct and regulated exposure to the asset class, which is currently Bitcoin. Risk Aversion: During the initial stages of a bull market, or when macroeconomic conditions are uncertain, investors tend to be more risk-averse. They prefer to allocate capital to Bitcoin, perceived as the safest and most established crypto asset, before venturing into the higher-risk, higher-reward altcoin space. Lack of Dominant Altcoin Narratives (Yet): While some altcoin sectors like AI, DePIN, or Real World Assets (RWAs) are gaining traction, a broad, compelling narrative that captures widespread retail and institutional attention for altcoins, similar to Bitcoin’s ETF story, has not fully materialized. Market Maturity: The crypto market is maturing. Institutional participants are more discerning. They conduct deeper due diligence, focusing on fundamental value, regulatory clarity, and sustainable tokenomics, rather than simply chasing speculative gains across all altcoins. Phased Market Cycles: Historically, crypto bull markets unfold in phases. Bitcoin often leads the charge, followed by large-cap altcoins (like Ethereum), and then smaller-cap altcoins and meme coins. The current market might simply be in the ‘Bitcoin-first’ phase. Historical Context: Past Rallies and Bitcoin All-Time High Behaviors To understand the current market, it’s crucial to look at historical precedents. Past rallies often provide clues, though every cycle has its unique characteristics. The original report notes that in previous rallies, Bitcoin highs coincided with stronger altcoin performance, citing examples where 75% (likely referring to the Feb 2021 period) and 40% (perhaps Nov 2021) of altcoins showed robust gains. Consider the 2017 and 2021 bull runs: 2017 Bull Run: Bitcoin’s initial surge to its then all-time high was followed by an explosive ‘altcoin season’ in early 2018, where many altcoins saw parabolic gains, some even outperforming Bitcoin significantly. 2020-2021 Bull Run: Bitcoin broke its 2017 high in late 2020 and continued its ascent into 2021. This was again followed by a broad altcoin rally, particularly strong in spring 2021, driven by DeFi, NFTs, and other emerging narratives. Ethereum, in particular, saw substantial growth. The current cycle, while exhibiting Bitcoin’s leadership, shows a more pronounced and prolonged altcoin lag at this stage. This suggests a potentially more deliberate and perhaps more institutionally-driven market. The ‘smart money’ might be consolidating positions in Bitcoin before strategically diversifying into select altcoins with strong fundamentals or compelling narratives. Navigating the Crypto Market Analysis : What Does This Divergence Mean? This unusual divergence between Bitcoin and altcoins presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. A thorough crypto market analysis is essential to interpret these signals correctly. Potential Interpretations: More Upside for Bitcoin: The initial report suggests that the current divergence implies Bitcoin’s rally may still have room to run. If altcoins haven’t caught up yet, it could mean that the broader market has not yet reached its peak euphoria phase, and Bitcoin’s ascent is still in its primary stage. A Healthier, More Sustainable Rally: Some analysts argue that a Bitcoin-led rally, rather than a speculative altcoin frenzy, indicates a more mature and sustainable market. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin provides a strong foundation, potentially leading to less volatile, more gradual growth across the ecosystem. Impending Altcoin Season: Many seasoned investors view the current lag as a sign that an ‘altcoin season’ is merely delayed, not canceled. Once Bitcoin consolidates its gains or its momentum slows, capital could rotate into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Increased Market Bifurcation: It’s also possible that the market is becoming more bifurcated, with Bitcoin establishing itself as a premier, lower-risk asset, while altcoins remain a higher-risk, higher-reward play. This could lead to a permanent shift in how different segments of the crypto market behave. Actionable Insights for Investors: Patience is Key: For altcoin holders, patience may be paramount. Historical patterns suggest that altcoins often follow Bitcoin’s lead, albeit with a delay. Strategic Rebalancing: Consider rebalancing portfolios. If Bitcoin has significantly outperformed, taking some profits and reallocating to fundamentally strong altcoins that have lagged could be a strategy, assuming you believe in their long-term potential. Focus on Fundamentals: When considering altcoins, prioritize projects with strong technology, clear use cases, active development, and robust communities. Avoid purely speculative plays. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to use DCA strategies to accumulate positions in both Bitcoin and chosen altcoins, mitigating volatility risks. Risk Management: Understand that altcoins carry higher risk. Diversify your altcoin holdings and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Future Cryptocurrency Trends : What to Expect Next? Predicting the future of cryptocurrency trends is always challenging, but the current market dynamics offer some clues about potential paths forward. The divergence between Bitcoin and altcoins sets the stage for several interesting scenarios: Rotation into Large-Cap Altcoins: Once Bitcoin’s initial surge cools, capital may first rotate into established large-cap altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and others with significant ecosystems and development activity. Ethereum’s upcoming upgrades, particularly those related to scalability and efficiency, could serve as a major catalyst. Sector-Specific Rallies: Instead of a broad altcoin season, we might see more targeted rallies in specific sectors that are gaining traction. This could include AI-related tokens, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), GameFi, or Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization projects. Investors will need to be highly selective. Increased Volatility for Altcoins: As capital moves more strategically, altcoins might experience more pronounced swings. Those with weak fundamentals or limited utility could struggle to regain their previous highs, while strong projects could see significant gains. Regulatory Impact: The evolving regulatory landscape will play a crucial role. Clearer regulations could attract more institutional money into altcoins, while uncertainty could continue to dampen enthusiasm. Innovation Driving Adoption: Continued innovation in blockchain technology, such as advancements in layer-2 solutions, cross-chain interoperability, and user-friendly applications, will be critical for driving broader adoption and, consequently, altcoin growth. The market is constantly evolving, and staying informed about these potential shifts is paramount. The current Bitcoin-led rally could be laying the groundwork for a broader market expansion, but it may unfold differently than in past cycles, demanding a more nuanced investment approach. In conclusion, while Bitcoin’s ascent to new highs is a cause for celebration among its holders, the accompanying altcoin lag is a notable characteristic of the current market cycle. This divergence, as highlighted by Sentimentrader, suggests that while Bitcoin may still have significant upside potential, the broader market’s full rally might be yet to come, or it may unfold in a more selective and mature manner than previously observed. Understanding the forces driving Bitcoin’s dominance and the reasons behind altcoin’s current underperformance is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto landscape. Patience, strategic analysis, and a focus on fundamental value will be key for investors looking to capitalize on the next phase of cryptocurrency trends .

I think this will be the right decision for America, and the economy will boom,” Pulte noted . The Beef Between Chair Powell and President Donald Trump Although not officially confirmed, the reports that Fed Chair Powell is considering to resign stems from the misalignment with the Donald Trump administration.

2025-07-11T22:20:11,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Reveals Explosive Upside Potential","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as Bitcoin continues its remarkable journey. After reaching an unprecedented all-time high, many are wondering: what’s next for the king of crypto? A recent insightful observation from a prominent industry expert suggests that the stage might be set for even greater heights. This isn’t just about celebrating past achievements; it’s about understanding the underlying market dynamics that could propel Bitcoin into a new phase of growth. Prepare to delve into the fascinating world of market indicators and expert analysis that points towards significant Bitcoin upside potential . Unlocking the Mystery: What Drives Bitcoin Upside Potential? In a recent revelation that has sparked considerable discussion across the crypto community, Jeff Park, the astute head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, shared a compelling perspective on Bitcoin’s current market standing. Despite Bitcoin unit price recently establishing a new all-time high, Park highlighted several intriguing observations on X (formerly Twitter): Low Open Interest: This suggests that there isn’t an excessive amount of speculative capital currently tied up in Bitcoin derivatives contracts. A low open interest can indicate that the market isn’t overheated with leveraged bets, leaving room for fresh capital to enter. Low Implied Volatility: Implied volatility reflects the market’s expectation of future price swings. When it’s low, it suggests that options traders are not anticipating large, sudden movements. While counterintuitive, this can sometimes precede significant price action, as the market might be underestimating an impending shift. Low Liquidity: A market with low liquidity means that large orders can have a more significant impact on price. While it can lead to increased volatility during sell-offs, it can also amplify upward movements if strong buying pressure emerges. Park succinctly summarized his analysis, stating, “All you need is a catalyst. No promises, but the probability is [Bitcoin goes] higher now than at any point this year.” This statement is a powerful beacon of hope for many investors, suggesting that the current calm might be the precursor to a storm of positive price action. It implies that the foundational elements for a substantial move are in place, awaiting the right trigger. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Outlook: What Do the Indicators Say? Understanding the broader crypto market outlook requires more than just glancing at price charts. It involves deciphering complex market indicators that offer clues about investor sentiment and potential future movements. Jeff Park’s analysis zeroes in on three critical metrics that, when combined, paint a picture of a market poised for a significant shift, rather than one on the verge of exhaustion. Why Low Open Interest Matters Open interest (OI) represents the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts (like futures or options) that have not yet been settled. High open interest often correlates with high speculative activity and can sometimes signal an overheated market, vulnerable to a sharp correction. Conversely, a low open interest, as observed by Park, can indicate a less crowded trade, meaning there’s less leveraged money that needs to be flushed out. This leaves ample room for new capital inflows to drive prices higher without immediate resistance from over-leveraged positions. The Significance of Low Implied Volatility Implied volatility (IV) is derived from the prices of options contracts and reflects the market’s expectation of future price fluctuations. When IV is low, it means options are cheaper, and traders are not pricing in large swings. Historically, periods of low implied volatility have often preceded significant price movements in Bitcoin. It’s akin to a coiled spring – a period of relative calm before a powerful release. This “calm before the storm” scenario suggests that the market might be underestimating Bitcoin’s true potential for an upward surge. The Double-Edged Sword of Low Liquidity Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without significantly impacting its price. Low liquidity means that even relatively small buy or sell orders can cause noticeable price movements. While this can exacerbate downward pressure during corrections, in an environment ripe for a catalyst, low liquidity can amplify upward momentum. If a wave of buying interest emerges, the limited supply available at current prices can quickly push Bitcoin’s value higher, creating a powerful virtuous cycle. Decoding Bitcoin Price Prediction: Are We Headed Higher? The core of Jeff Park’s statement lies in his Bitcoin price prediction : the probability of Bitcoin going higher now is greater than at any point this year. This isn’t just a hopeful wish; it’s an assessment based on the confluence of these specific market conditions. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding the methodology behind such predictions is crucial. Analysts like Park often look for divergences between price action and underlying market health indicators. When Bitcoin hits a new all-time high, but speculative metrics like open interest and implied volatility remain subdued, it suggests that the rally isn’t fueled by irrational exuberance or excessive leverage. Instead, it implies a more organic, sustainable growth, potentially driven by spot market demand and long-term conviction. Consider the following: Healthy Consolidation: The current market structure might be a period of healthy consolidation after reaching an ATH, rather than a top. This allows new buyers to enter and previous holders to take profits without crashing the market. Reduced Speculative Overhang: With low open interest, there’s less risk of a massive cascade of liquidations if the price were to dip slightly, making the market more resilient to minor corrections. Anticipation of Catalysts: The market is effectively a dry tinderbox, waiting for a spark. Potential catalysts could include: Further institutional adoption (e.g., new ETF approvals, corporate treasury allocations). Significant regulatory clarity or positive legislative developments. Macroeconomic shifts favoring scarce assets (e.g., inflation concerns, weakening fiat currencies). Technological advancements or network upgrades (though less direct for BTC price action, it can boost overall crypto sentiment). Embracing the BTC All-Time High: A Foundation for Future Growth? Reaching a BTC All-Time High is often seen as a significant psychological and technical milestone. For some, it signals the peak, while for others, it’s merely a stepping stone. Jeff Park’s analysis suggests the latter. Instead of being a point of exhaustion, this ATH, coupled with the subdued derivatives market, might represent a robust foundation for the next leg up. Historically, Bitcoin has often consolidated after hitting new highs before embarking on further parabolic runs. What makes this particular ATH different, according to Park, is the absence of the typical speculative frenzy that often accompanies such milestones. This indicates that the current price discovery is perhaps more fundamentally driven, allowing for a more sustainable climb. Key takeaways from the current ATH scenario: Indicator Current State (per Park) Implication for Upside Open Interest Low Less leverage, more room for fresh capital. Implied Volatility Low Market underestimating future price moves, coiled spring. Liquidity Low Amplifies price movements with strong buying pressure. Price Action New All-Time High Strong underlying demand, not overleveraged. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Analysis? The insights from Jeff Park, coming from Bitwise – a prominent institutional crypto asset manager – carry significant weight. His perspective offers a glimpse into how sophisticated players conduct their institutional crypto analysis . For institutional investors, risk management and understanding market structure are paramount. The observations of low open interest, implied volatility, and liquidity are not just technical points; they are crucial signals for deployment of large capital. Institutions typically seek markets that offer both potential for growth and manageable risk. A market that has hit an ATH but isn’t showing signs of speculative overheating can be particularly attractive. It suggests that the price appreciation is more “real” and less prone to sudden, violent corrections driven by leveraged liquidations. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor not just price, but also key on-chain and derivatives metrics. Risk Management: While the outlook is positive, market volatility is inherent. Always practice sound risk management, including setting stop-losses and only investing what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s journey is often characterized by significant corrections within broader bull markets. A long-term perspective often yields the best results. Identify Catalysts: Keep an eye on potential catalysts mentioned earlier, as these could be the triggers for the next major move. Are There Any Challenges or Counterarguments? While Jeff Park’s analysis is compelling, it’s essential to consider potential challenges. The crypto market is inherently unpredictable. A “catalyst” might not materialize as expected, or unforeseen macroeconomic events could shift sentiment. Regulatory crackdowns, significant exchange hacks, or sustained FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) could also impact price action. Moreover, low liquidity, while amplifying upside, can also amplify downside if a strong selling wave emerges. Investors should always conduct their own due diligence and consider a balanced perspective. Conclusion: The Path Ahead for Bitcoin Jeff Park’s insightful analysis from Bitwise provides a powerful bullish argument for Bitcoin’s immediate future. By highlighting the subdued nature of speculative indicators despite a new all-time high, he paints a picture of a market that is consolidating healthily and preparing for its next major move. The low open interest, implied volatility, and liquidity suggest a market that is not over-leveraged, but rather poised for an “explosive” surge once the right catalyst emerges. While no one can promise future returns, the confluence of these factors significantly enhances the probability of further Bitcoin upside potential . As Bitcoin continues to mature and gain wider acceptance, understanding these nuanced market signals becomes increasingly vital for navigating its exciting journey.

2025-07-11T22:01:58,"Top US-Based Crypto Exchange by Trading Volume Coinbase Adds Support for DeFi Tokens SKY and USDS","Two decentralized finance (DeFi) altcoins have abruptly gained support from the top US-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase. In a new announcement, Coinbase says it’s adding Sky ( SKY ), formerly known as MakerDAO, as well as its associated stablecoin USDS ( USDS ), to its suite of digital asset products. “Sky (SKY) and USDS (USDS) are now live on Coinbase.com and in the Coinbase iOS & Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets.” News of the additions had little impact on the tokens, as SKY is trading for $0.0836 at time of writing, a 3% gain during the last 24 hours, while USDS has remained pegged to the value of the US dollar. According to the crypto analytics firm Messari, MakerDao first rebranded to Sky in August 2024, replacing its governance token MKR with SKY and its dollar-pegged digital asset DAI with USDS. Messari says that the rebrand was a part of the development team’s “endgame” strategy, which is a plan to promote growth and accessibility within the DeFi ecosystem as well as create bridges to traditional finance. “The rebranding is intended to appeal to a broader audience beyond the crypto-native community, signaling a shift towards traditional finance and potentially increasing adoption… Overall, the rebranding to Sky is a strategic move within Maker’s Endgame Plan to enhance DeFi growth, accessibility, and resilience, although it faces challenges in community acceptance and brand identity.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-11T22:00:17,"BTC Digital Unveils Bold $1M Ethereum Reserve for Strategic Growth","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant news as Nasdaq-listed blockchain firm , BTC Digital (BTCT), makes a strategic leap forward. In a move that underscores growing institutional confidence in digital assets, the company has announced the establishment of a substantial $1 million Ethereum reserve . This bold step isn’t just about accumulating digital currency; it’s a clear signal of their ambitious digital asset strategy aimed at scaling operations and solidifying their position in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. What Does a $1 Million Ethereum Reserve Mean? For a publicly traded company like BTC Digital , setting up an Ethereum reserve signifies more than just holding a cryptocurrency. It represents a calculated investment and a diversification of their treasury assets. Historically, companies have held traditional fiat currencies or gold as reserves. However, as the digital economy matures, forward-thinking entities are increasingly looking to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) for various strategic advantages. Strategic Asset Holding: ETH is not just a digital currency; it’s the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain, a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and NFTs. Holding ETH provides exposure to this vast ecosystem. Operational Flexibility: An Ethereum reserve can potentially be used for future investments, liquidity provisions for decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives, or even as collateral for borrowing in the crypto space. Market Confidence: Such a move from a Nasdaq-listed blockchain firm can instill confidence among investors, signaling a long-term commitment to the digital asset space and a belief in its future growth. Why is BTC Digital Betting on Ethereum? The decision by BTC Digital to allocate $1 million specifically to Ethereum is particularly noteworthy. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines for institutional adoption, Ethereum’s ecosystem offers unique functionalities that appeal to companies focused on technological innovation and scaling. Ethereum’s robust network, active developer community, and its pivotal role in the DeFi and NFT sectors make it an attractive asset for a blockchain firm looking to expand its operational capabilities and embrace future trends. This strategic allocation reflects a nuanced understanding of the crypto market beyond mere price speculation. It suggests that BTC Digital sees Ethereum as a foundational technology for their scaling efforts, potentially integrating ETH into their services or using it to fuel future blockchain-based projects. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption BTC Digital ‘s move is part of a broader trend of increasing institutional crypto adoption. What was once considered a niche or speculative asset class is now becoming a legitimate component of corporate treasuries and investment portfolios. From MicroStrategy’s significant Bitcoin holdings to Tesla’s past forays into crypto, and now BTC Digital ‘s Ethereum reserve , the landscape is shifting. This trend is driven by several factors: Factor Description Inflation Hedge Some institutions view cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Diversification Adding digital assets can diversify traditional portfolios, potentially reducing overall risk. Technological Innovation Companies want to be at the forefront of emerging technologies like blockchain and Web3. Market Opportunity The potential for significant returns in a rapidly expanding market. The entry of more regulated and publicly traded entities like BTC Digital lends credibility to the entire digital asset space, paving the way for even wider acceptance. Crafting a Resilient Digital Asset Strategy For any company venturing into cryptocurrencies, a well-defined digital asset strategy is paramount. BTC Digital ‘s establishment of an Ethereum reserve is a prime example of a deliberate and calculated approach. This isn’t a speculative gamble; it’s an integration of digital assets into their core business plan for scaling and future growth. Key components of a robust digital asset strategy often include: Clear Objectives: Defining why the assets are being acquired (e.g., treasury diversification, operational use, investment). Risk Management: Implementing protocols for security, custody, and volatility management. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the evolving legal and regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies. Long-Term Vision: Aligning digital asset holdings with the company’s overarching business goals. BTC Digital ‘s move highlights the importance of a strategic, rather than reactive, approach to crypto adoption for businesses aiming for sustainable growth. What’s Next for BTC Digital and the Crypto Market? The establishment of this Ethereum reserve by BTC Digital is likely to be watched closely by other companies considering similar moves. It sets a precedent for Nasdaq-listed blockchain firm s to integrate significant digital asset holdings into their financial strategies. As the institutional embrace of crypto continues, we can anticipate more companies exploring not just Bitcoin, but also Ethereum and other promising altcoins, as part of their diversified digital asset portfolios. This development reinforces the narrative that digital assets are maturing beyond speculative instruments into legitimate components of global financial and corporate strategies. For investors and enthusiasts alike, it’s a positive sign of the continued mainstreaming of blockchain technology. Final Thoughts: A Strategic Horizon BTC Digital ‘s decision to establish a $1 million Ethereum reserve is more than just a headline; it’s a testament to the evolving perception of digital assets within traditional finance. It showcases a proactive digital asset strategy designed to empower a leading blockchain firm for future growth and operational expansion. As institutional crypto adoption accelerates, such moves by entities like BTC Digital will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the financial landscape of tomorrow, making the future of decentralized technology look brighter than ever.

2025-07-11T22:00:05,"Bitcoin Breaks $118,000—But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns","Bitcoin has set a new all-time high (ATH) above $118,000, but on-chain data from Glassnode shows BTC volume remains low despite the breakout. Bitcoin Volume Still At Historically Low Levels Just recently, Glassnode had revealed that volume related to Bitcoin had dropped to yearly lows, potentially hinting at the start of a summer lull. Now, following the breakout to new highs, the on-chain analytics firm has shared updated data in a reply to an X user, showcasing how volume has changed since. From the chart, it’s visible that both the Spot and Futures Volumes, corresponding to Bitcoin trading activity occurring on the spot and futures platforms, respectively, plummeted at the end of June and remained low into early July. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle—Next Stop $164? With the latest price breakout, however, both metrics have seen an increase, suggesting activity has noted an uplift across both the spot and futures markets. That said, while there has indeed been an uptick in trading, volumes still remain low when compared to history. Historically, rallies have usually only been sustainable when they have been able to capture mass attention from the traders. This is because the fresh activity is what ends up providing fuel for these runs to keep going. “The takeaway here is that BTC hit an ATH despite thin liquidity – worth paying attention to,” notes the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen whether the activity increase would continue in the coming days or if the lull is here to stay. In some other news, a key Bitcoin indicator still remains outside the euphoria zone, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. The metric in question is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) of the long-term holders. The NUPL measures, as its name suggests, the net amount of unrealized profit or loss that the BTC investors are currently holding. Here, the NUPL of the long-term holders (LTHs) specifically is of interest, who are the investors holding their coins for more than 155 days. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin LTH NUPL over the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin LTH NUPL has observed a rise alongside the latest price rally as LTH profits have grown. However, despite this, the indicator stands at 0.69, which is under the 0.75 level that has historically separated euphoric markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Not Just Hype—$4.4B Inflows Back The Move “This cycle has seen just ~30 days above the 0.75 threshold, compared to 228 days in the previous cycle,” says the analytics firm.

In a post on the X (formerly Twitter) platform today, Hayes claimed that a “monster altcoin season” will begin in the market. Hayes, who has long maintained a cautious stance, has now completely reversed this view and announced his ultra-bullish outlook. According to Hayes, the primary drivers of this new era will be market indicators and political developments in the US. His statements have resonated widely with both investors and analysts. Related News: Watch Out: Grayscale Announces the Possible Addition of 29 New Altcoins to its Investment Products - There Are Big Surprises, Here's the List Hayes had previously warned that the Treasury General Account (TGA) fill, the US Treasury Department's process of rebuilding cash reserves at the Fed, could pressure risky assets by draining liquidity from the market, which he argued could weaken short-term market sentiment. However, this week's sudden surges have virtually dispelled these concerns. Bitcoin's consecutive new highs in just two hours prompted Hayes to reassess the market. Hayes noted that Ethereum has also gained significant momentum during the same period, suggesting that the leading altcoin could be the precursor to a strong altcoin season. Hayes also highlighted market expectations that US President Donald Trump might soften his stance on tariffs. Using the humorous phrase “TACO” (Trump Always Chicken Out), Hayes argued that this policy could also create an environment favorable for risky assets. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T20:42:27,"Bitcoin’s breakout isn’t about the Fed, it’s about market structure: analysts","Bitcoin’s record-breaking climb past $118,000 isn’t tied to Fed policy or equities. Instead, analysts say spot ETF demand and corporate treasury strategies are driving this historic move. Meanwhile, altcoins are surging in BTC’s wake. Bitcoin ( BTC ) shattered its previous all-time high of $116,000 on July 11, peaking at $118,872 before settling near $117,300, pulling a 3% daily gain that masked the frenzy beneath the surface. Ethereum ( ETH ) outpaced BTC with a 7% surge, reclaiming $3,000 for the first time since February, while memecoins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) posted double-digit rallies. According to Thomas Perfumo, Kraken’s global economist, Bitcoin is “breaking a months-long range” and entering fresh territory for price discovery. Perfumo noted that over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours alone, while Bitcoin dominance slipped slightly—a rare sign that altcoins are leading the charge. “Concurrently, strength in U.S. equities, currently trading at or near all-time highs, is showcasing a robust risk-on environment, a supportive backdrop for crypto,” Perfumo said in a statement obtained by crypto.news on Friday. With Bitcoin dominance dipping to 54%, the market is witnessing a rare convergence, one where institutional accumulation and derivatives chaos fuel gains across the board, not just at the top. The question now isn’t whether macro matters, but whether crypto’s market mechanics have permanently decoupled from traditional triggers. You might also like: DDC announces $100m Bitcoin treasury partnership with Animoca Brands Market structure, not macro, is steering the rally What distinguishes this rally from previous surges is its foundation. Analysts aren’t pointing to central banks or macro volatility as the spark. Instead, they’re watching structural flows inside the crypto market itself, most notably the direct impact of spot ETF demand. Bitcoin ETFs logged their biggest single day of inflows in 2025 on Thursday, pulling in $1.18 billion, according to SoSoValue data . Ethereum ETFs followed suit with their second-strongest performance of the year at $383 million. These are not speculative futures bets or proxy trades through microcap equities. They are direct, capital-intensive commitments to spot assets. Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, views the breakout through that lens. “In my view, this isn’t a macro-driven rally, but rather an isolated event. That said, recent U.S. policy developments such as fiscal expansion and expectations of further monetary easing have created a backdrop that is undeniably favorable for Bitcoin. We’re seeing Bitcoin treasury strategies proliferate across companies, which reflects growing institutional confidence in BTC as a balance sheet asset,” he also said in a statement sent to crypto.news. Sondergaard emphasized that Bitcoin’s clean break through key liquidation levels, and its ability to hold above them, acted as a trigger point for this latest market-wide rally. What comes next hinges on sustainability. Past rallies relied on macroeconomic tailwinds. This one is testing whether crypto’s internal mechanics, such as ETF flows, corporate adoption, and derivatives markets—can independently support valuations. If so, we may be witnessing the birth of a new market paradigm, one where crypto writes its own rules.

2025-07-11T20:30:03,"Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 – Price Magnet Forming","Ethereum just broke above the critical $3,000 level, marking a major technical milestone after surging over 20% since Tuesday. This decisive breakout signals renewed strength in the second-largest cryptocurrency, with bulls reclaiming control after weeks of tight consolidation. The move is reigniting interest across the broader altcoin market, which had remained relatively muted during Bitcoin’s recent rally to all-time highs. Now, with ETH leading the charge, many altcoins are showing signs of reversal and upward momentum. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level – Relief Or Reversal? According to top analyst Ted Pillows, a key factor behind Ethereum’s rally is the large concentration of liquidity resting just above the $3,000 mark. Once Ethereum cleared the $2,850 resistance, momentum rapidly accelerated, driving price through the $3,000 level and into a new range of opportunity. This rally comes amid a broader shift in market sentiment. As Bitcoin sets record highs, Ethereum and other altcoins appear poised to catch up. The big question now: can ETH maintain this level and lead a full altcoin season, or is this just a temporary breakout before another round of consolidation? Ethereum Breaks Out Of Consolidation Range Ethereum has spent the last several weeks consolidating within a clearly defined range that began in early May. The altcoin hovered between support around $2,800 and resistance just below $3,000, with multiple failed attempts to break above. That changed yesterday. ETH finally closed above this key resistance, signaling a potential breakout and confirming the start of a new bullish phase. This move comes as broader macroeconomic conditions improve. Strong labor market data in the US, alongside signs of de-escalation in several global conflicts, have helped reduce uncertainty and reignite risk appetite across financial markets. With Bitcoin reaching new highs and risk-on sentiment returning, Ethereum’s breakout may signal the next wave of upside for altcoins. Top analyst Ted Pillows highlighted a key technical factor: “ETH liquidity is lying above $3,000 — and liquidity is a magnet.” This means that large clusters of buy and stop orders are concentrated above this level, attracting price movement toward those zones. Now that Ethereum has broken past resistance, the presence of high liquidity could accelerate its move upward as traders chase momentum. The breakout also holds symbolic weight. It shows that investors are regaining confidence in Ethereum’s value proposition, particularly with the broader altcoin market showing signs of life. If ETH can hold this breakout and establish $3,000 as new support, the next leg higher could materialize quickly, opening the door to targets in the $3,400–$3,600 range. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason ETH Breaks Major Resistance Ethereum (ETH) has decisively broken above the psychological and technical resistance at $3,000, closing its most recent candle at $3,008.97. This breakout follows a strong 15% daily surge, as seen in the chart, marking a powerful move backed by growing bullish momentum. Volume has expanded significantly, confirming trader conviction and institutional participation in this move. The breakout puts an end to nearly two months of sideways action, with ETH previously locked between the $2,500–$2,850 range. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently near $2,796, was breached with strength, acting as a springboard for price acceleration. The reclaim of this moving average adds technical validation to the breakout and signals the beginning of a new bullish leg. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves ETH is now in a key zone for potential continuation. As long as bulls defend the $2,850–$2,900 level as support, Ethereum has room to rally toward $3,400 and beyond. With Bitcoin trading at all-time highs and macro conditions turning favorable for risk assets, ETH could lead the next wave of altcoin expansion.

On Thursday, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) booked its largest daily inflow to date, with over $300 million, pushing its total assets under management to $5.6 billion, data compiled by Farside Investors show. That’s part of a broader resurgence in ether-backed investment products. The nine U.S.-listed ETH ETFs attracted a combined $703 million in net inflows this week, according to crypto data provider SoSoValue . Although Friday’s data is still pending, it has already marked the third-strongest weekly haul since the products launched last July. Investor demand has picked up lately even as ether’s price has lagged behind bitcoin this year, a new report from asset manager Fineqia noted. The AUM of ETH-backed exchange-traded products (ETPs) grew 61% faster in the first half of 2025 than the market capitalization of the underlying asset, a sign of steady inflows into the products, the report said. The report notes that ETP demand began to rebound by late April and continued into June, outpacing ETH's price gain. The capital flood helped fuel ETH's rebound to $3,000, its highest price in more than four months.

2025-07-11T20:20:34,"IBIT Bitcoin ETF Unleashes Unprecedented Growth, Dominating the Investment Landscape","In a stunning display of market demand and institutional confidence, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, has not just entered the investment arena; it has emphatically conquered it. Surpassing an astounding $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) in a mere 374 days, the IBIT Bitcoin ETF has set an unprecedented benchmark, becoming the fastest ETF in history to reach this colossal milestone. This isn’t just a win for BlackRock; it’s a monumental moment for the entire world of cryptocurrency investment , signaling a profound shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. The Phenomenal Rise of the IBIT Bitcoin ETF: A New Benchmark? The numbers speak for themselves, painting a vivid picture of IBIT’s meteoric ascent. As reported by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the IBIT Bitcoin ETF hit the $80 billion mark in just over a year. To put this into perspective, the previous record holder, Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), took a staggering 1,814 days—nearly five times longer—to achieve the same feat. IBIT’s current AUM stands at an impressive $83 billion, solidifying its position as the 21st largest ETF globally, a truly remarkable achievement for a product that was only launched recently. This rapid accumulation of capital underscores a significant shift in investor appetite and a growing comfort with Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. The sheer velocity of this ETF AUM growth is not merely a statistical anomaly; it reflects a powerful underlying current of institutional and retail interest converging on a regulated, accessible pathway to Bitcoin exposure. Understanding the Power of a Bitcoin Spot ETF: What Makes IBIT Different? For years, the crypto community and traditional finance alike awaited the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF in the United States. Why was this such a big deal? Unlike futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, which track the price of Bitcoin futures contracts, a spot ETF directly holds actual Bitcoin. This direct exposure is crucial for several reasons: Direct Price Correlation: A spot ETF aims to track the price of Bitcoin more closely, reducing the basis risk associated with futures contracts. Simplicity for Investors: It offers a straightforward, regulated, and familiar investment vehicle for traditional investors who might be wary of direct cryptocurrency purchases, managing private keys, or dealing with unregulated exchanges. Institutional Comfort: For large institutions like pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers, investing through an ETF provides the regulatory clarity, liquidity, and oversight they require, making it easier to allocate capital to digital assets within their existing frameworks. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, brought its considerable weight and reputation to the table with IBIT, instilling confidence in a market segment often perceived as volatile and risky. Their robust infrastructure, compliance protocols, and extensive distribution network played a pivotal role in attracting significant capital from a diverse range of investors. Unpacking the Surge in ETF AUM Growth: What’s Driving This Unprecedented Inflow? The incredible ETF AUM growth seen in IBIT is not accidental. Several key factors have converged to create this perfect storm of success: Pent-Up Demand: For years, institutional investors and even many retail investors have sought a regulated, secure, and easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership. The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs finally unlocked this immense pent-up demand. BlackRock’s Brand Power: As a titan in the asset management industry, BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF space lent immediate credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. Their track record and robust compliance frameworks reassured hesitant investors. Market Timing: The launch coincided with a period of renewed bullish sentiment in the crypto market, fueled by Bitcoin’s halving event and growing anticipation of interest rate cuts. This positive macro environment encouraged inflows. Ease of Access: Traditional investment platforms now offer IBIT, allowing investors to buy and sell shares through their existing brokerage accounts, just like any other stock or ETF. This accessibility removes significant barriers to entry for new investors. Competitive Landscape: While IBIT is leading, the presence of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs (like Fidelity’s FBTC, Ark Invest’s ARKB, etc.) has created a healthy competitive environment, driving innovation and investor choice. The Dawn of Unprecedented Institutional Bitcoin Adoption IBIT’s rapid ascent is arguably the clearest signal yet of accelerating institutional Bitcoin adoption . This isn’t just about retail investors dipping their toes; it’s about large financial entities integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios and investment strategies. What does this signify? Validation of Bitcoin: Institutional capital flows validate Bitcoin as a legitimate, investable asset class, moving it further away from its early reputation as a niche or speculative digital curiosity. Diversification for Portfolios: Institutions are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a diversifier, a hedge against inflation, and a high-growth asset in a low-yield environment. Market Maturation: The presence of regulated ETF products contributes to the overall maturation of the cryptocurrency market, bringing more liquidity, stability, and transparency. Broader Acceptance: As more institutions gain exposure, it paves the way for even wider acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial system. We could see more crypto-backed products, derivatives, and services emerge. This trend is not confined to the U.S. alone; global interest in similar regulated products is soaring, with other countries closely watching the success of these U.S.-based spot ETFs. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cryptocurrency Investment? The success of the IBIT Bitcoin ETF has profound implications for the future trajectory of cryptocurrency investment . It suggests a future where digital assets are increasingly interwoven with traditional finance, offering both new opportunities and challenges. Opportunities Ahead: Increased Mainstream Participation: More accessible products will attract a broader base of investors, potentially leading to greater market capitalization and liquidity for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Innovation in Financial Products: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for similar products for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, further broadening the institutional investment landscape. Enhanced Market Stability: As institutional capital tends to be more patient and long-term oriented, increased institutional participation could potentially reduce some of the extreme volatility historically associated with crypto markets. Challenges to Consider: Regulatory Scrutiny: With increased adoption comes greater regulatory attention. Future regulations could impact market dynamics. Market Volatility: While institutional money may bring stability, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Investors in IBIT are still exposed to the inherent price swings of Bitcoin. Competition: The ETF market is highly competitive. While IBIT leads, other funds are vying for market share, which could lead to fee wars and constant innovation. Custody Risks: While ETFs mitigate some risks for individual investors, the underlying assets (Bitcoin) still require secure custody solutions, which come with their own set of challenges. For individual investors, the emergence of products like IBIT offers a convenient avenue for exposure. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in a Bitcoin Spot ETF is still an investment in Bitcoin itself, carrying the associated risks. Diversification, understanding one’s risk tolerance, and conducting thorough due diligence remain paramount. A New Era Dawns for Digital Assets The incredible achievement of the IBIT Bitcoin ETF , reaching $80 billion faster than any other ETF in history, is more than just a financial milestone. It’s a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s maturation and its undeniable integration into the mainstream financial system. This unprecedented ETF AUM growth signals a new chapter for institutional Bitcoin adoption , opening doors for broader cryptocurrency investment and reshaping the future of global finance. As IBIT continues its remarkable trajectory, it serves as a beacon, highlighting the immense potential and growing acceptance of digital assets in the portfolios of both traditional and modern investors.

2025-07-11T20:15:28,"OCC’s New Chief Could Redefine Crypto-Banking Relations in the U.S.","Jonathan Gould’s appointment as Comptroller of the Currency is expected to shift the regulatory landscape for crypto in U.S. banking, raising both industry hopes and concerns over centralizing federal oversight. Jonathan Gould Confirmed as New OCC Head The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jonathan Gould as the new Comptroller of the Currency, a pivotal role in the country’s financial regulatory framework. Gould, a former senior executive at blockchain infrastructure firm Bitfury , secured the position following a narrow 50-45 Senate vote, marking another key appointment under President Donald Trump’s administration aimed at reshaping crypto regulation in the United States. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau within the U.S. Treasury, plays a vital yet often understated role in overseeing national banks and shaping federal policy on financial innovation, including digital assets. Gould’s confirmation is expected to influence how traditional banking institutions interact with cryptocurrencies over the next five years. Crypto-Friendly Track Record Jonathan Gould brings a history of crypto advocacy to the OCC. During his previous tenure at the agency, Gould served as senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel, working under Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks. Brooks, known for his pro-crypto stance, championed regulatory frameworks that opened doors for digital asset firms, including granting Anchorage Digital the first federal crypto bank charter. After Brooks left to head Bitfury, Gould followed, serving as the company’s chief legal officer. At the OCC, Gould had previously supported policies enabling U.S. banks to offer crypto custody services and backed early moves towards integrating digital assets into regulated financial infrastructure. His return could set the stage for further initiatives aimed at expanding banks’ roles in the crypto economy, particularly in areas like stablecoin management and Bitcoin ETF options trading. Regulatory Balance and Centralization Concerns While Gould’s appointment has been welcomed by parts of the crypto industry, it raises concerns about the centralization of authority over digital asset oversight. Critics argue that consolidating power within a single federal agency might sideline state-level initiatives and, depending on political shifts, expose the sector to abrupt regulatory reversals. The previous administration under President Joe Biden took a markedly cautious approach to crypto, with federal regulators including the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issuing stringent guidelines for banks engaging with digital assets. These measures, seen by industry players as restrictive, included accusations of cutting off crypto firms from essential banking services. Gould’s confirmation could mark a reversal of that strategy, potentially positioning the OCC as a more crypto-friendly agency. However, the risk remains that if political tides turn against digital assets, the same centralized control could make it harder for crypto-friendly states and local regulators to maintain supportive environments.

The S&P ( SP500 ) on Friday closed -0.3% at 6,259.75 points, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) seesawed but ended -0.2% at 20,585.53 points, and the blue-chip Dow Jones ( DJI ) finished -0.6% at 44,371.51 points. Week-to-date, the indices were -0.3% , -0.1% , and -1% , respectively. Trump announced on Thursday a 35% tariff on Canada and warned about further hikes if Ottawa decided to respond. These levies are expected to take effect Aug. 1, according to a letter posted on his Truth Social account. In addition, Trump said he would impose blanket tariffs of 15-20% on other remaining countries. “Equity markets were a nothingburger all week at index level. All manner of analysis suggests that equities ‘should’ put in a short-term correction around now. Price does not, thus far, agree, with the ascent from the April lows continuing to confound fundamentalists everywhere,” Alex King, investing group leader of Cestrian Capital Research , told Seeking Alpha. Over in the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) rose 7 basis points to 4.42%, while the 2-year yield ( US2Y ) rose 1 basis point to 3.90%. On Friday's economic calendar, the monthly Treasury Statement budget showed an unexpected surplus of $27B in June, when it was expected to be in deficit by $41.5B. Meanwhile, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a new all-time high on Friday, fueled by growing institutional interest and supportive signals from the Trump administration. “The big winners this week have been Bitcoin and Ether, the latter of which is quietly going mainstream under the guise of Everything Is Token. We believe both will trend higher even if equities do, one day, take a breather,” King said. The focus will shift slightly from tariffs and trade developments to the second quarter U.S. earnings season, which kicks off next week with reports from major banks.

2025-07-11T20:11:20,"Bhutan Capitalizes on Bitcoin Rally With $23.7M Sale, Outpaces German Strategy","As Bitcoin surges past $112,000, Bhutan strategically liquidates a portion of its holdings at peak market levels, securing significant gains while other governments, notably Germany, face scrutiny for poorly timed sales. Bhutan Executes Timely Bitcoin Sale Bhutan’s sovereign investment fund, Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), made headlines on Wednesday by transferring 213.5 BTC, valued at $23.73 million, to a Binance deposit address. This marked the second consecutive week of sizeable transfers from the Himalayan kingdom, signaling an effort to capitalize on current market strength. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed the transaction, which strategically occurred just hours before Bitcoin reached its highest price level in months. The move is part of Bhutan’s broader treasury strategy, which has increasingly leaned on digital assets as a sovereign wealth tool. Despite recent sales, Bhutan maintains a substantial Bitcoin reserve of 11,711 BTC, estimated at $1.3 billion at current valuations, positioning it as one of the most crypto-forward governments globally. Bitcoin Climbs After Weeks of Consolidation The sale comes as Bitcoin broke past the $112,000 mark this week after spending nearly two months fluctuating between $105,000 and $111,000. Data from Coingecko recorded over $60 billion in global trading volume within a 24-hour window as the world’s largest cryptocurrency surged amid growing market optimism and institutional interest. This bullish momentum, largely fueled by persistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and sustained support from institutional investors, has created sharp contrasts in the approaches of government-backed crypto holders. Germany’s Mistimed Sell-Off Highlights Bhutan’s Prudence In stark contrast, the German government offloaded 49,858 BTC between June 19 and July 12, 2024, at an average price of $57,600 per coin. The total liquidation netted $2.87 billion, but the decision proved costly as Bitcoin’s value more than doubled shortly after the sell-off. At current market rates, the same Bitcoin stockpile would be worth approximately $5.54 billion, representing $2.67 billion in missed unrealized gains. Germany’s poorly timed exit, executed just before the market’s significant rally, has sparked criticism over its asset management strategy. Growing Portfolio and Modest Altcoin Gains Arkham’s data revealed that Bhutan’s overall crypto holdings increased to $1.304 billion as of July 10, a notable rise from $1.26 billion the previous week. The bulk of this $38.4 million gain stemmed from Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, though smaller assets within the government’s wallet also posted modest gains. Tokens such as AIKEK and KIBSHI appreciated by approximately 17% and 42%, respectively, while BOBO, a memecoin holding of 69 million units, added a marginal $3.60 in value. These incremental increases, though minor compared to Bitcoin’s performance, reflect Bhutan’s diversified digital asset portfolio strategy, extending beyond just mining and Bitcoin accumulation.

2025-07-11T20:10:37,"US Stock Market Opening: Why the Decline is Sending Ripples Through Crypto","The financial world often operates like a complex, interconnected web. When one major segment experiences turbulence, it’s natural for ripples to spread, affecting other markets. Today, the news from the US stock market opening lower has certainly caught the attention of investors worldwide, and especially those deeply invested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. While crypto markets often march to their own beat, they are not entirely immune to the broader economic winds blowing through traditional finance. Understanding these connections is crucial for navigating today’s volatile landscape. Understanding the Latest US Stock Market Opening The start of trading today saw a noticeable downturn across all three major U.S. stock indices. This immediate dip often reflects prevailing investor sentiment and macroeconomic concerns that are shaping decisions across various asset classes. For many, the traditional stock market acts as a barometer for the overall economic health, and its movements can provide insights into the appetite for risk among global investors. Here’s a quick snapshot of how the indices opened: S&P 500: -0.39% Nasdaq: -0.31% Dow: -0.60% These figures, while seemingly small percentages, represent billions of dollars in market capitalization and reflect a cautious, if not bearish, sentiment right from the opening bell. Decoding the Recent Stock Market Decline : What the Numbers Say A stock market decline , even a modest one at the open, can be triggered by a confluence of factors. These often include: Inflation Concerns: Persistent inflation can erode purchasing power and corporate profits, leading investors to pull back. Interest Rate Hikes: Central banks raising interest rates to combat inflation can make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, slowing economic growth. Economic Data: Weaker-than-expected jobs reports, manufacturing data, or consumer confidence surveys can signal an impending economic slowdown. Geopolitical Tensions: Global events and political instability can introduce uncertainty, causing investors to seek safer assets. Corporate Earnings: Disappointing earnings reports from major companies can drag down sector-specific or broader market performance. While the exact catalysts for today’s specific opening dip would require deeper analysis of concurrent news, these are the general forces that often contribute to such movements. Investors are constantly weighing these factors, and their collective decisions shape the market’s trajectory. How Nasdaq Performance Reflects Tech Sector Jitters The Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, often acts as a bellwether for investor appetite for higher-risk, higher-reward assets. The observed -0.31% dip in Nasdaq performance at the open suggests that the tech sector, which has often led market rallies in recent years, is currently facing headwinds. This could be due to concerns over rising interest rates, which disproportionately impact growth stocks by making future earnings less valuable, or perhaps specific company news within the tech space. When the tech giants on the Nasdaq experience pressure, it can send a signal across the broader market. Many crypto projects, particularly those focused on Web3, DeFi, and NFTs, are often seen through a similar lens as tech startups – high growth potential, but also higher risk. Therefore, a struggling Nasdaq can sometimes foreshadow or coincide with similar sentiment in the digital asset space. The S&P 500 Dip : A Broader Economic Bellwether? The S&P 500, representing the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies, is widely considered the best gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Its -0.39% S&P 500 dip at the open indicates a broader market apprehension that extends beyond just the tech sector. This index includes a diverse range of industries, from finance and healthcare to consumer staples and industrials. A decline here suggests that concerns are not isolated but are affecting a wide swath of the U.S. economy. For crypto investors, observing the S&P 500 is crucial because it often reflects the general ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’ sentiment. When the S&P 500 shows weakness, it often means investors are pulling back from riskier assets across the board, which can include cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Crypto Market Reaction to Traditional Finance Volatility The big question for our readers is: what does this crypto market reaction look like? Historically, there have been periods where cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, have shown a correlation with traditional stock markets, particularly the Nasdaq. When the stock market dips, Bitcoin and other digital assets can sometimes follow suit, especially during times of macroeconomic uncertainty. This is often attributed to: Liquidity Crunch: In times of panic, investors might sell off crypto to cover losses in traditional markets or to increase their cash reserves. Risk-Off Sentiment: Both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are often considered ‘risk-on’ assets. When investors become risk-averse, they tend to divest from these assets first. Institutional Adoption: As more institutional money enters the crypto space, the correlation with traditional finance might strengthen, as these institutions manage diversified portfolios. However, it’s also important to remember that the crypto market has its own unique drivers, including technological advancements, regulatory news, network upgrades, and community sentiment. While today’s stock market opening might send initial ripples , the long-term trajectory of digital assets will depend on a broader set of factors. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the current market dynamics, what can crypto investors do? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on both traditional financial news and crypto-specific developments. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand that volatility is inherent in both markets. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level. Diversify (Wisely): While diversification within crypto is important, consider how your overall investment portfolio balances traditional and digital assets. Long-Term Perspective: For many, cryptocurrencies are a long-term investment. Short-term market fluctuations, while impactful, may not dictate the ultimate success of your strategy. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Consider a strategy of regular, smaller investments rather than trying to time the market. This can help mitigate the impact of volatility. Conclusion: The Interconnected Financial Landscape The lower opening of the major U.S. stock markets today serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of global finance. While cryptocurrencies strive for decentralization and independence, they are not entirely decoupled from the macroeconomic forces that influence traditional assets. The stock market decline , reflected in the Nasdaq performance and S&P 500 dip , inevitably sends ripples through the entire investment ecosystem, prompting a cautious crypto market reaction . For crypto enthusiasts, this highlights the importance of not just understanding the blockchain and tokenomics, but also keeping a pulse on broader economic indicators. By doing so, investors can better anticipate potential shifts and make more informed decisions in their journey through the exciting, yet sometimes unpredictable, world of digital assets.

2025-07-11T20:04:55,"On-chain Metrics Indicate Potential for Further Bitcoin Rally","On July 11, Bitcoin breached the $118,000 mark. This growth occurred amid active buying by long-term investors. According to CryptoQuant, the balance of ”accumulators” reached an annual maximum of 248,000 BTC. The figure has increased by 71% since June 22. Such strong demand was last seen on December 20, 2025. At that time, Bitcoin traded at $97,000, and the number of coins held at holders' addresses reached a record 278,000 BTC. A Signal for Growth Demand is recovering from a dip in the fourth quarter of 2024. Although net interest remains negative, it is growing rapidly, indicating that buyers are strengthening their positions. Analyst Axel Adler Jr. believes that the first point for profit-taking will come at a price of $130,900. The MVRV ratio must reach 2.75 to begin distribution. The expert compared the market capitalization to the realized capitalization. Glassnode noted a $4.4 billion increase in realized capitalization while crossing $113,000. This shows active investor trades rather than speculative growth, analysts said. $150,000 Target Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead has set a $150,000 target for Bitcoin. The expert sees a bullish cup-and-handle formation that formed in June. Reidhead is confident of further gains for the asset after it returns to $112,000. Kyle Reidhead wrote, ”See you at $150,000.” The chief analyst of Bitget Research, Ryan Lee, shares the same forecast, provided that the current trend and inflows of institutional capital are maintained. In a commentary to ForkLog, the expert said that several factors are influencing the strengthening of Bitcoin: Pro-cryptocurrency rhetoric from the administration of US President Donald Trump Steady inflows of funds into ETFs Increased interest from corporate treasuries All this creates conditions for a continuation of the bullish trend as early as the start of the third quarter. As Lee noted, growth above $117,000 is an important signal for the market and can only be an intermediate stop before a new spurt. The average projected price of Bitcoin in the coming months is $125,000, with an expected trading range of $105,000 to $150,000. The $108,500 (support) and $130,000 (resistance) levels remain important technical benchmarks. According to Lee, consolidation above $130,000 will open the way to a new phase of growth. At the same time, the expert recalled a characteristic feature of the crypto market—high volatility: ”Sharp growth can be accompanied by a rapid correction—down to $110,000, or even into the $100,000–$105,000 range, where the key support zone is located. However, the fundamental trend remains positive.”",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9910/on-chain-metrics-indicate-potential-for-further-bitcoin-rally,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

BTC soared to a new all-time high, just days after crossing $112,000, as it raced to $118,403 before registering a marginal decline and moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 5% in the past 24 hours, trading around $116,617. Meanwhile, ETH rallied over 7%, reaching an intraday high of $2,972 before moving to its current level of $2,963. Ripple (XRP) also traded in positive territory, with the price up over 6%, trading around $2.56. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) crossed the crucial $160 mark thanks to the market rally. The altcoin is up almost 5%, trading around $164. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 10%, trading around $0.198, while Cardano (ADA) is up almost 11%, trading around $0.685. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable gains. Remixpoint Raises $215 Million To Expand Bitcoin Holdings Energy company Remixpoint has raised 31.5 billion yen ($215 million) to expand its Bitcoin treasury. The firm will allocate all the raised funds to purchase BTC. Remixpoint raised the funds through its 25th series of stock acquisition rights and a fourth series of unsecured bonds. The series of stock acquisition rights will create over 55 million new shares, and represents a 39.5% share dilution. Remixpoint is currently the 30th largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, holding 1,051 BTC. The firm plans to increase its holdings to 3,000 BTC in the near term. The news comes after Remixpoint announced that CEO Takashi Tashiro will be paid in Bitcoin as part of the company’s efforts to be “in the same boat” as its shareholders. Remixpoint’s board has unanimously approved its Bitcoin investment strategy, highlighting the potential to enhance corporate value from a risk-return perspective while preserving flexibility. “We have become even more convinced of Bitcoin’s future, and this decision is the result of extensive discussions. We understand the difference between seizing opportunities and playing it safe, as well as the distinction between a challenge and recklessness.” US Treasury Officially Removes Controversial Biden-era Reporting Rule In a big win for DeFi platform compliance with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the US Treasury Department officially removed the controversial DeFi broker reporting rules. The Biden-era rule required DeFi platforms to issue IRS 1099-DA forms for all user transactions. The repeal was part of an earlier act in which the US Congress repealed the rule. President Donald Trump signed the bill in April. Several DeFi-friendly congressmen viewed the rule as a burden on DeFi platforms. They also believed it went against the principles of decentralization. Under the new reporting rules, DeFi platforms will be exempt from several compliance requirements. These include know your customer (KYC) rules and transaction reporting. Additionally, the Congressional Review Act mechanism also ensures the IRS cannot issue a substantially similar rule in the future unless authorized by Congress. However, the repeal is applicable only to non-custodial DeFi applications, with centralized exchanges still subject to 1099-DA forms. Bitcoin (BTC) Could Move To $120,000 Predictions that Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest rally could soar past $120,000 during its latest bull run are on track, with the flagship cryptocurrency crossing $118,000 during the ongoing session and showing no signs of slowing down. While BTC is soaring to record levels, altcoins are emerging as bigger winners, with Ethereum (ETH) crossing the crucial $3,000 mark, and Ripple (XRP) surging past $2.50. ETH is up over 8%, while XRP is up 7%, with buyers firmly in control. BTC broke past $112,000 on Thursday after weeks of trading in range, and continued its uptrend on Friday. Analysts have stated that there is clear evidence of renewed spot demand and conviction buying. “Bitcoin’s latest breakout above $112,000 confirms the market has broken out of its ‘indecisive’ phase. There's clear evidence of renewed spot demand and conviction buying.” The flagship cryptocurrency’s market dominance has also reached multi-year highs. Strong ETF demand, exchange outflows, and corporate treasuries are giving significant bullish signals for the Bitcoin market. Altcoins Surge Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance jumping to multi-year highs has raised questions about altcoins. While BTC is cornering significant capital, altcoins have significant potential for a rally. According to analysts, an altcoin rally could likely come down to macroeconomic factors. “Right now, the trend favors Bitcoin. But just beneath it, altcoins are quietly positioning for a late-summer rotation. But if macro shocks hit (a hawkish Fed pivot or geopolitical escalation), Bitcoin could spike in dominance as risk appetite vanishes.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has soared to a new all-time high just hours after crossing $112,000 on Thursday. The flagship cryptocurrency’s latest push was powered by strong demand from retail and institutional investors, and the crypto-friendly policies of the Trump administration. According to analysts from Sygnum Bank, BTC’s latest rally is being driven by its growing recognition as a safe-haven asset. Katalin Tischhauser, the head of research at Sygnum Bank, stated that BTC has outperformed and has been decoupling on days when the S&P 500 and broader markets corrected. “This has been supported by Bitcoin’s increasing status as a safe haven asset in the face of fiat debasement, also confirmed by the first US state signing a Bitcoin reserve bill into law, following the federal Bitcoin reserve established by Executive Order.” Bitcoin reserves across centralized exchanges have also been declining since April, a sign of long-term confidence in the asset. Declining reserves could lead to a supply shock-driven rally. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to a new all-time high of $118,403, barely 24 hours after it crossed $112,000. BTC’s jump past $118,000 triggered a wave of liquidations, wiping out over $1 billion in short contracts in 24 hours. According to data from Coinglass, the value of shorts liquidated on July 10 is the single-largest liquidation event this year. Long contracts worth $120 million were also liquidated in the same timeframe, highlighting the market’s renewed bullish momentum. Derivatives exchange Bybit accounted for most of the liquidations, with $291 million in contracts liquidated, 98% of which were shorts. HTX saw $138 million in liquidations while Gate ($71.8 million), OKX ($54.62 million), and Binance ($54.56 million) completed the top 5. Analysts pointed out that the current breakout is far calmer and structurally sound, and highlighted that despite the surge, important indicators suggest the market is not overheated. BTC’s MVRV ratio stands at 2.2, significantly lower than the overheated levels seen during rallies in March and December 2024. There has also been a shift in investor behavior. Analysts noted that during previous bull markets, short-term holders made up around 30% of the market. However, the current rally has seen that number drop to 15%, meaning less volatility and a lower risk of sudden selloffs. Miners have also remained relatively quiet, while retail investors are largely missing. BTC has mostly traded positively since last Tuesday’s low of $105,328. The flagship cryptocurrency recovered from this level, rising nearly 3% and settling at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC crossed $110,000 for the first time since May, reaching an intraday high of $110,583. The price registered a marginal decline from this level and settled at $109,637. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC was back in the red on Friday, dropping 1.41% to $108,097. Price action returned to positive over the weekend as BTC rose 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,231. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in the red, dropping almost 1% to $108,273. However, market sentiment began picking up, with the price rising 0.62% on Tuesday and settling at $108,942. Buyers retained control as BTC rose over 2%, briefly crossing $112,000 for the first time before settling at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC raced to an intraday high of $116,401 before settling at $115,159. The flagship cryptocurrency soared past $118,000 during the ongoing session, reaching an intraday high of $118,403 before moving to its current level of $117,255, up almost 2%. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is on the verge of reclaiming $3,000, a level the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has not seen since February 2025. ETH is up nearly 7% in the past 24 hours, as the crypto market soars to new highs. The price had lagged behind BTC this cycle, but the narrative has finally turned bullish thanks to growing ETF inflows and tokenization narratives fueling investor confidence. If ETH closes above $3,000, it could trigger another rally, taking it past the $3,500 mark. Data analytics platform Swissblocks highlighted that the current scenario for ETH is more bullish than Q2, potentially marking the beginning of alt season. ETH inflows have gained momentum, with institutional demand also rising. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures open interest jumped to $3.27 billion, the highest since February 2. The jump suggests increased institutional positioning, indicating a growing appetite among investors to gain exposure to ETH. ETH registered a sharp drop on Tuesday (July 1), dropping over 3% to $2,407. Despite the bearish sentiment, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 7% to cross the moving averages and settle at $2,572. Buyers retained control on Thursday as ETH rose 0.79%, reaching an intraday high of $2,636 before settling at $2,592. However, it lost momentum on Friday, dropping over 3% and settling at $2,509. ETH recovered over the weekend, rising 0.35% on Saturday and over 2% on Sunday to settle at $2,572. Source: TradingView Despite the positive weekend, ETH was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.12% to $2,543. The price rebounded on Tuesday, rising nearly 3% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,616. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH rose almost 6% to cross $2,700 and settle at $2,770. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price reached an intraday high of $3,001 before settling at $2,950. The current session sees ETH up over 1%, trading around $2,981. If ETH closes above $3,000, it could extend its rally beyond $3,500. The MACD and RSI show strong bullish sentiment, but ETH could see a small correction before resuming its rally. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) lost momentum during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down after reaching an intraday high of $166. SOL crossed the crucial $160 mark on Thursday when it raced to $165 before closing at $164. The altcoin’s uptick came amid a jump in market activity as 23-hour trading volumes rose 19% to $4.9 billion, indicating that traders could be readying for a potential breakout. Institutional interest in SOL is also picking up, adding weight to an already-bullish scenario as altcoins get dragged higher by BTC’s jump to a new all-time high. Despite SOL’s impressive performance, it remains substantially lower than its January peak of $294. Analysts, including James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, predict that a Solana ETF could be approved by October. SOL registered a substantial drop last Tuesday, falling over 5% to $147. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 4% to reclaim $150 and settle at $152.

Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price soared past $160, reaching an intraday high of $165 before settling at $164. The current session sees SOL marginally down as it runs into resistance around the 200-day SMA. A break above this level could see the price reach $200. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) finally broke above the 200-day SMA and the resistance around $2.20, with bulls controlling the momentum.

2025-07-11T20:04:31,"US National Debt Surges $384,700,000,000 in One Week As Massive Pile of Debt Shatters New All-Time High","The US national debt has reached a new record high just one week after a massive spending bill cleared Congress. The Treasury’s Debt to the Penny database shows the government’s mountain of debt surged $384.7 billion from July 3rd to the 9th. That brings the total outstanding debt to an all-time high of $36.6 trillion. This rapid rise is largely driven by the refilling of the Treasury General Account (TGA), as the government resumes borrowing to cover delayed payments and restore cash reserves. The spending bill, signed by President Trump, raised the debt ceiling by a whopping $5 trillion – the largest increase in US history. The debt ceiling now stands at $41.1 trillion, averting default until 2027. The wide-ranging legislation permanently extends the 2017 tax cuts, reducing federal revenue by trillions over the next decade. After accounting for offsets, the CBO forecasts the bill will add around $2.8 trillion to the deficit in 10 years. The Trump administration disputes the estimate, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he believes the bill’s tax cuts and deregulation will spur economic growth that outpaces deficit concerns.

2025-07-11T20:02:01,"Is the BTC Rally Driven by Spot or Leveraged Demand? Glassnode Weighs In","The past 24 hours have witnessed bitcoin (BTC) record all-time highs (ATHs) again and again, with the latest being at almost $119,000. While it is evident that institutional demand and whale movements are driving this rally, analysts have identified another cohort of investors who have contributed to the surge. According to a tweet by the market insights firm, Glassnode, demand from leveraged traders is playing a bigger role in this rally than spot investors. Leveraged Demand Drives BTC Rally Glassnode revealed that Bitcoin’s spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has been on a decline for weeks. CVD analyzes investor sentiment by telling whether aggressive buyers or sellers are dominating the market. The metric measures trading activity by comparing buying and selling volume over a period. Over the past weeks, bitcoin’s spot CVD has recorded rare buy-side spikes, with the latest being on July 9. Conversely, futures CVD has been more reactive. The futures market has recorded frequent buy-side spikes, indicating that traders have been buying BTC aggressively. Since BTC touched $112,000, spot traders have been selling, while futures investors have been buying. Funding for the spot market has remained low and even became negative at some point. As a result, this bitcoin rally has been fueled more by leverage than spot demand. Futures traders have been buying more; however, the market has witnessed little confirmation from spot investors. Notably, Glassnode said low funding is a sign that positioning is not yet crowded. Unfortunately, this shows a structurally fragile setup, which can only get better if spot interest returns. No Signs of Overheating Yet Glassnode’s analysis suggests there is no strong structural backing to support this rally. However, the Bitcoin market is yet to see any signs of overheating, meaning that there is still room for additional growth. The market appears steady, alongside metrics like the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) and Short-term holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). Others, like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) and Miner Position Index (MPI), also signal that sell-side activity is muted. These indicators suggest that investors are cautiously optimistic and not eager to offload their assets. While the market awaits bitcoin’s next move, there is a surge in open interest, with long positions dominating. This comes after shorts have been wiped out , with liquidations running close to $1 billion. The post Is the BTC Rally Driven by Spot or Leveraged Demand?

2025-07-11T20:00:23,"US Dollar Decline Triggered by Loss of Confidence in US Trade and Fiscal Policies, Says Private Banking Giant","The vice president of the private investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman says that America’s trade policies are weakening the US dollar. In a new interview on CNBC, Elias Haddad explains why the greenback is falling by record levels this year. “Clearly the decline in the dollar here reflects the loss of confidence in the US trade, security and perhaps even fiscal policy because you also see a bit of a divergence between the dollar index and the rate differential. I think that reflects this policy uncertainty.” He says the protectionist trade policies under the Trump administration are primarily behind the ongoing drag on the US currency. “First of all, higher tariffs. The average effective tariff rate in the US went from 2% early this year to about 18% right now. That’s a downside risk to growth, upside risk to inflation. That’s bearish for the US dollar. “ Haddad says the ongoing trade war threatens to accelerate the declining role of the US dollar as a primary reserve currency. He says the government’s efforts to narrow the trade deficit also appear to be counterproductive. “The policies aimed at narrowing the trade deficit mean you’ve got less US dollar flowing overseas. There will be less dollars flowing back into US securities – so for all these reasons, we remain bearish on the US dollar.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
