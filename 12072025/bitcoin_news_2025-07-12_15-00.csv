2025-07-12T12:57:21,"Investors have committed $16 million to Bitcoin futures, Bank of Russia report","Russian investors have bought Bitcoin futures worth more than $16 million in less than a month of trading, according to stats released by the Central Bank of Russia. Private individuals account for the majority of purchases, the monetary authority noted, reminding Russian citizens that crypto derivatives carry similar risks to their underlying assets. CBR gauges Russia’s new Bitcoin futures market The Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) has published statistical data revealing the size of the country’s young market for futures based on cryptocurrency prices. It added those numbers to the latest edition of its “Overview of Financial Market Risks.” As of June 27, the total volume of open net positions of retail investors was approximately 1.25 billion rubles (over $16 million), the document unveiled. “The share of individuals in the total volume of long positions is 97%,” the regulator highlighted. The trading of futures linked to the value of the leading cryptocurrency started on June 4 in Russia, when the Moscow Exchange launched contracts on the shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) expiring in September. That became possible in late May when the CBR allowed financial institutions to offer crypto derivatives to qualified investors while warning both financial firms and their clients in Russia against direct investments in digital assets. This week, it took the opportunity to reiterate its concerns. “It’s worth noting that these instruments carry increased risks for investors,” the monetary authority stated, emphasizing: “Cryptocurrencies are volatile and risky, therefore, investments in instruments whose pricing depends on them will also have such characteristics.” The most common positions, open by the majority of investors (2,800), are under 500,000 rubles (below $6,500), the report detailed. At the same time, private investors controlling larger capital, with portfolios exceeding 100 million rubles, account for a significant portion of the invested funds, the central bank noticed. These are followed by other big players with capital ranging between 10 million to 50 million rubles. “However, it is worth noting that the number of investors in these cohorts is relatively small, the Bank of Russia commented. It also remarked: “The opposite short position is mainly occupied by non-resident legal entities.” Crypto derivatives still out of reach for ordinary Russians While recent reports have revealed that Russians hold over $25 billion worth of crypto assets, financial regulators in the country, including the central bank and the finance ministry, remain opposed to giving ordinary citizens access to cryptocurrencies or crypto derivatives. In March this year, the CBR suggested to allow a limited number of investors to acquire and trade digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) within the framework of an “experimental legal regime” (ELR). The bank said these should be “highly qualified investors” only. To fall in that category, which is yet to be legally defined, private individuals would need to prove annual income of 50 million rubles (over $600,000) or more and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles ($1.2 million), the authority proposed. Meanwhile, a new study, the results of which were published by the business daily Vedomosti this week, showed that 52% of Russia’s qualified investors already have crypto in their wallets. And another 38%, who haven’t bought yet, intend to do so in the future, bringing the total of those interested in crypto investments to 90% of the respondents. The Central Bank of Russia, however, remains stubborn in its stance against Bitcoin. Its governor, Elvira Nabiullina, recently insisted the monetary policy regulator has no current plans to add cryptocurrencies to its reserves. The CBR also rejects any possibility of permitting the use of digital coins such as BTC for payments within its territory, outside the ELR. The special regime allows Russian companies to employ BTC and other coins in international settlements with trading partners amid financial restrictions imposed with war-related sanctions on Moscow.

2025-07-12T12:52:57,"AltSeason Incoming? Open Interest in These Altcoins Nears $1B Milestone—What’s Next?","The post AltSeason Incoming? Open Interest in These Altcoins Nears $1B Milestone—What’s Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is showing strong signs of life beyond Bitcoin. Futures Open Interest (OI)—a key metric reflecting the number of outstanding derivative contracts—has surged for several top altcoins. XRP, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) are seeing a sharp rise in leveraged positions, with OI across these tokens nearing or surpassing the $1 billion mark. Historically, a rise in both price and OI signals not just trader enthusiasm but an influx of new capital, often a precursor to broader altcoin rallies. As market sentiment shifts from Bitcoin to other large-cap cryptos, investors are now questioning: Is AltSeason finally around the corner? What Is Open Interest and Why It Matters? Open Interest (OI) refers to the total number of active futures or options contracts that haven’t been settled. It serves as a key indicator of market participation and sentiment. When OI rises alongside price, it often signals that new money is entering the market, supporting a stronger trend. In the altcoin space, increasing OI can indicate heightened investor confidence and potential for price expansion. Conversely, if OI rises while prices fall, it could hint at bearish leverage or a setup for liquidation events. Monitoring OI helps traders gauge momentum and anticipate potential breakout or breakdown scenarios. Top Altcoins With OI Above $1B Ripple (XRP ) XRP’s OI has exploded past $3.4 billion, rising by nearly $1 billion in just a few days. This surge has come alongside a notable price rally of over 20%, suggesting that whales and institutions may be positioning early for a large move. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s OI on CME and Binance has risen to about $3.2 billion, the highest since February. The momentum is backed by strong ETF inflows and renewed interest from institutional investors, especially as ETH trades comfortably above $2,650. Solana (SOL) Solana continues to attract speculative interest, with OI rapidly climbing as traders anticipate explosive gains during any altcoin rotation. With DeFi and NFT activity heating up on the network, SOL could be a top beneficiary if market momentum sustains. Top Altcoins Approaching $1B OI BinanceCoin (BNB) BNB’s open interest (OI) currently ranges between $567M and $781M, reflecting a significant rise following its recent $1B token burn. The increase in OI suggests growing trader interest and capital inflow into BNB futures, pointing to heightened speculative momentum. If this trend continues alongside price gains, it may support a bullish breakout. However, elevated OI can also increase the risk of volatility if leverage becomes overheated. Traders should monitor OI shifts closely for signs of strength or exhaustion. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Fartcoin’s current futures open interest (OI) stands at approximately $754 million, showing an 8%+ rise in the past 24 hours—reflecting strong speculation and bullish positioning. This puts Fartcoin near the top of meme-coin derivatives activity by open interest. The rising OI, especially alongside positive funding rates and price momentum, suggests traders are targeting further upside (possibly toward ~$1.50–2.00 or more). However, elevated leverage also increases the risk of sharp corrections if sentiment shifts. Aave (AAVE) Aave’s aggregate futures open interest is currently around $438.7 million, reflecting positions in both coin-margined and stablecoin-denominated contracts. Over the past 24 hours, OI has slightly declined by approximately 1.2%. According to Messari, AAVE’s total open interest stands near $339.9 million, up about 3.3% over the past week. This level suggests moderate trader involvement, signaling steady interest without extreme leverage risk. Does This Signal an AltSeason? A rise in OI across altcoins, paired with consistent upward price movement, is often a precursor to AltSeason. This is when money flows out of Bitcoin and into altcoins, causing explosive rallies across the board. Here’s why the current setup is bullish: BTC dominance is stabilizing or weakening. Altcoins are seeing increasing OI without large liquidation events. Retail sentiment is reviving as news of large gains (especially XRP) spreads. Despite the bullish setups, factors like Bitcoin volatility and overleveraged markets & macroeconomic pressure may negatively impact, delaying the Altseason. However, the Open Interest (OI) of the top tokens has surged significantly, which suggests the market momentum is clearly heating up. If Bitcoin remains stable or consolidates around key levels, the setup for a July-to-August is stronger than it’s been in months.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/altseason-incoming-open-interest-in-these-altcoins-nears-1b-milestone-whats-next/,"ALTCOIN|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ETH","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T12:30:49,"Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Is Your Crypto Portfolio Ready for Bitcoin’s Reign?","BitcoinWorld Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Is Your Crypto Portfolio Ready for Bitcoin’s Reign? The crypto world is a dynamic place, constantly shifting between periods of explosive growth for alternative cryptocurrencies and times when Bitcoin firmly holds the reins. Currently, the spotlight is on the latter, with the Altcoin Season Index, a crucial metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registering a modest 28 at 0:35 UTC on July 12. This figure, down two points from the previous day, clearly signals that the market is deep into a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your digital asset portfolio, and how can you navigate these shifting tides? What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index and How Does It Work? For many in the crypto space, understanding the broader market cycle is key to making informed decisions. The Altcoin Season Index is designed precisely for this purpose. It serves as a compass, guiding investors through the often-turbulent waters of cryptocurrency market cycles. Here’s a breakdown of how this fascinating index operates: The Core Comparison: The index rigorously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This long-term window helps smooth out daily volatility and provides a clearer picture of sustained trends. Exclusions for Clarity: To ensure the index accurately reflects genuine altcoin growth, it specifically excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC). These tokens are pegged to other assets or represent wrapped versions of other cryptocurrencies and do not typically exhibit independent price action driven by market sentiment in the same way as native altcoins. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially declared in an Altcoin Season, a significant majority—at least 75%—of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. This indicates broad-based strength across the altcoin market. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, a Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day timeframe. The current reading of 28 clearly falls within this range, underscoring Bitcoin’s present dominance. The Scoring System: The index scores range from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger leaning towards Altcoin Season, while a lower score, like our current 28, points to Bitcoin’s command. Understanding this metric is fundamental for anyone serious about cryptocurrency investing . It provides a macro-level view that can inform your strategic asset allocation. Why Are We In a Bitcoin Season Right Now? The current low reading on the Altcoin Season Index isn’t just a random number; it reflects underlying dynamics in the crypto market trends . Several factors often contribute to Bitcoin’s periods of dominance: Flight to Safety: In times of economic uncertainty or broader market instability, investors often flock to Bitcoin, viewing it as a relatively safer and more established asset compared to the more volatile altcoins. Bitcoin’s larger market capitalization and longer track record contribute to this perception. Institutional Adoption: Major institutional interest, particularly with the advent of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, has funneled significant capital directly into Bitcoin. This influx of large-scale investment can disproportionately boost Bitcoin’s price and dominance compared to the broader altcoin market. Halving Cycle Anticipation: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically precede significant bull runs. In the lead-up to a halving, Bitcoin often sees increased accumulation as investors anticipate future price appreciation, pulling focus and capital away from altcoins. Dominance Metric: The Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) often mirrors the Altcoin Season Index. When BTC.D rises, it means Bitcoin is capturing a larger share of the total crypto market capitalization, which is characteristic of a Bitcoin Season. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions can lead to a risk-off sentiment in traditional markets, which often spills over into the crypto space. During such periods, Bitcoin is often seen as the primary hedge or store of value within the digital asset ecosystem. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends: What Does This Mean for Investors? Understanding that we are in a Bitcoin Season is crucial for adapting your investment approach. It suggests that while Bitcoin might be experiencing steady growth or consolidation, many altcoins could be lagging or even seeing declines against Bitcoin. Here’s what this period of crypto market trends often entails: Reduced Altcoin Volatility (Relative to Bitcoin): While altcoins are inherently volatile, during Bitcoin Season, their movements often become more subdued or directly correlated with Bitcoin’s price action. They might not see independent breakouts. Focus on Large Caps: Capital tends to flow into larger, more established altcoins first when sentiment eventually shifts, before trickling down to smaller, more speculative assets. The Importance of Bitcoin Price Action: Bitcoin’s performance becomes the primary driver for the entire market. A strong Bitcoin run can eventually pull altcoins up, but a Bitcoin correction can drag them down even more severely. Sector Rotation: Even within a Bitcoin Season, there can be brief periods where certain altcoin sectors (e.g., AI tokens, GameFi, DePIN) experience mini-runs due to specific news or developments. However, these are often short-lived and do not signify a broader Altcoin Season. For investors, this period can be a time for strategic accumulation of quality altcoins at potentially lower prices, or a focus on Bitcoin itself. Strategies for Optimal Altcoin Performance in a Bitcoin-Dominated Market Even when Bitcoin is leading the charge, there are still ways to optimize your altcoin performance . It’s not about abandoning altcoins entirely, but rather about being more selective and strategic. Consider these actionable insights: Accumulate Quality Projects: Use periods of altcoin underperformance to accumulate projects with strong fundamentals, clear utility, active development teams, and robust communities. Look beyond the hype and focus on long-term value. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the bottom, consistently invest a fixed amount into your chosen altcoins over time. This strategy mitigates risk and averages out your purchase price. Portfolio Rebalancing: If your portfolio has become heavily weighted towards Bitcoin during its run, consider rebalancing by taking some profits from Bitcoin and reallocating to undervalued altcoins you believe in. However, do this cautiously and in line with your risk tolerance. Research and Due Diligence (DYOR): This cannot be stressed enough. In a Bitcoin Season, many altcoins will bleed against Bitcoin. Identifying the ones with genuine potential requires deep research into their technology, tokenomics, use cases, and competitive landscape. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on the Bitcoin Dominance chart. A significant drop in BTC.D could be an early signal that altcoins are starting to gain strength, potentially foreshadowing the next Altcoin Season. Remember, patience is a virtue in crypto. Altcoin Season will eventually return, but positioning yourself wisely during Bitcoin’s reign is key to capitalizing on future opportunities. Smart Cryptocurrency Investing: Principles for Any Market Season Regardless of whether it’s an Altcoin Season or a Bitcoin Season , certain fundamental principles of cryptocurrency investing remain constant. Adhering to these can help protect your capital and foster long-term growth. Here are key principles for smart investing: Risk Management is Paramount: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Crypto markets are notoriously volatile. Diversify your portfolio across different assets and sectors to spread risk. Define Your Investment Goals: Are you a short-term trader or a long-term holder? Your goals will dictate your strategy. For long-term investors, market cycles like Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season are opportunities to accumulate. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Keep up with major news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements, but avoid getting caught up in daily FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Emotional Discipline: The crypto market tests emotional resilience. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on price swings. Stick to your pre-defined investment plan. Security First: Always prioritize the security of your assets. Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. These principles form the bedrock of successful participation in the digital asset space, helping you navigate both the exhilarating highs and challenging lows. Challenges and Opportunities in a Bitcoin Season While a Bitcoin Season might seem less exciting for altcoin enthusiasts, it presents its own set of challenges and unique opportunities. Challenges: Altcoin Underperformance: Many altcoins will struggle to gain ground against Bitcoin, leading to ‘altcoin bleed’. Patience Required: It can be frustrating to see your altcoin holdings stagnant or declining while Bitcoin rises. False Breakouts: Some altcoins might experience brief pumps, only to quickly retrace, trapping inexperienced traders. Opportunities: Accumulation: A chance to buy quality altcoins at potentially discounted prices. Research Time: More time to conduct thorough research on projects without the pressure of rapidly moving markets. Portfolio Restructuring: An ideal period to re-evaluate your portfolio and consolidate positions into stronger assets. Conclusion: Adapting to the Rhythm of the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index at 28 is a clear signal: we are currently in a Bitcoin Season . This isn’t a cause for panic, but rather an invitation to adjust your strategy. Understanding how the index works, why Bitcoin is currently dominant, and the broader crypto market trends allows you to make more informed decisions. While the allure of massive altcoin gains is powerful, recognizing Bitcoin’s current reign is paramount. Focus on solid cryptocurrency investing principles: research, risk management, and patience. Use this period to identify strong projects, accumulate strategically, and prepare for the eventual shift back towards broader altcoin performance . The crypto market moves in cycles, and being attuned to these rhythms is the key to long-term success.

2025-07-12T12:25:46,"Here’s Bitcoin’s path to $250,000 by Q4, according to expert","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ongoing bullish run shows no signs of slowing, with an analyst projecting that the asset could reach $200,000 by 2025. To this end, trading expert Michaël van de Poppe forecasts that Bitcoin will reach a record high of $250,000 by Q4 2025, according to his July 11 post on X. He expects the maiden digital asset to reach $125,000 in July, climb to $150,000 by the end of the quarter, and ultimately target $250,000 by year-end. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Poppe’s outlook is guided by Bitcoin’s ability to break decisively above the $110,000 and $112,000 resistance zone, which had capped previous rallies. He noted that late June saw liquidity sweep below $105,000, followed by accumulation around $100,400 and $105,000, paving the way for the breakout. The recent move above $110,000 was accompanied by rising volume, indicating strong buying momentum. While a short-term pullback is possible as liquidity above $112,000 is absorbed, Poppe sees $125,000 and $150,000 as near-term targets, with a potential parabolic run to $250,000 if these levels give way. Key Bitcoin price levels to watch Separately, pseudonymous analyst BitBull, in a July 12 X post , echoed similar targets. He noted that after breaking $117,000, Bitcoin could push toward $120,000 in the coming days, followed by a period of consolidation. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: BitBull This pattern, he said, resembles February 2024, when Bitcoin paused after a sharp rally, giving altcoins room to catch up before resuming its climb. BitBull projects Bitcoin could then advance to $135,000 and $140,000, marking a potential local top. Bitcoin price analysis At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $117,810, representing a gain of more than 8% over the past week. Bitcoin price chart.

2025-07-12T12:20:05,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Unlocking the Astonishing $500,000 BTC Bull Run Potential","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Unlocking the Astonishing $500,000 BTC Bull Run Potential Imagine Bitcoin soaring to a staggering $500,000 by year-end. While it might sound like a distant dream, recent Bitcoin price prediction analyses suggest this audacious target isn’t entirely out of reach. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a possibility rooted in deep technical patterns and evolving macroeconomic landscapes that could propel the world’s leading cryptocurrency into an unprecedented rally. Unpacking the Audacious Bitcoin Price Prediction: Is $500,000 Possible? The notion of Bitcoin hitting half a million dollars might seem extraordinary, yet it’s a figure gaining traction among seasoned analysts. A significant Bitcoin price prediction comes from anonymous crypto analyst apsk32, who points to BTC’s current position relative to its long-term power curve trendline. This mathematical model is crucial because it tracks Bitcoin’s inherent exponential growth, acting as a historical roadmap for its price trajectory. Currently, BTC finds itself two years ahead of this trendline, a position historically associated with what analysts term the ‘extreme greed’ zone. Historically, this ‘extreme greed’ phase has preceded euphoric market peaks, specifically observed in the bull runs of 2013, 2017, and 2021. If the established four-year market cycle continues to repeat its pattern, apsk32 anticipates a substantial surge, projecting BTC to reach between $200,000 and $300,000 by Christmas. This momentum is then expected to gradually recede in early 2026, marking the potential end of this particular cycle’s peak. Decoding the BTC Price Analysis: The Power Curve and Historical Cycles To truly grasp the potential outlined in this audacious BTC price analysis , it’s essential to understand the underlying principles driving these predictions. The ‘long-term power curve trendline’ isn’t just a fancy term; it’s a robust mathematical framework that has, with remarkable accuracy, mapped Bitcoin’s exponential ascent over its lifetime. This curve suggests that despite its volatility, Bitcoin adheres to a predictable growth trajectory over extended periods. The concept of a ‘four-year cycle’ is equally pivotal in this BTC price analysis . This cycle, often correlated with Bitcoin’s supply shock events, has historically dictated periods of accumulation, rapid price appreciation (the bull run), and subsequent consolidation. The ‘extreme greed’ zone, as identified by apsk32, represents the latter stages of this rapid appreciation phase. Past cycles have shown that when Bitcoin enters this zone, it signifies a period of intense speculative interest and widespread FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), driving prices to new all-time highs before a natural cooling-off period. Here’s a look at how Bitcoin has historically performed during these peak cycle years: Cycle Peak Year Approximate Price Peak Historical Context 2013 ~$1,100 Early adopter euphoria, first major parabolic surge. 2017 ~$20,000 Retail investor boom, widespread media attention. 2021 ~$69,000 Institutional adoption, corporate balance sheet inclusion. 2024/2025 (Projected) $200K – $500K Global macroeconomic shifts, continued institutional integration. Macroeconomic Tailwinds Fueling Bitcoin Growth: What to Watch? Beyond the technical charts, a powerful confluence of macroeconomic factors is also poised to ignite significant Bitcoin growth . Satraj Bambra, CEO of perpetual trading platform Rails, emphasizes that shifts in global monetary policy and economic indicators could serve as potent catalysts for further gains, particularly looking ahead to 2025. Bambra highlights three critical macroeconomic signals that historically favor risk assets like Bitcoin: An Expanding U.S. Federal Reserve Balance Sheet: When the Fed expands its balance sheet, it typically involves quantitative easing (QE), injecting more liquidity into the financial system. This increased money supply often seeks higher returns, flowing into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. A Pivot to Lower Interest Rates: Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing and make traditional savings less attractive, pushing investors towards assets with higher potential yields, including digital currencies. This encourages both institutional and retail investors to deploy capital into growth-oriented sectors. A Falling U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): A weaker U.S. dollar often correlates with stronger commodity prices and increased investment in alternative assets. As the dollar loses purchasing power, investors seek hedges, and Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ becomes an appealing option. These combined factors signal a renewed era of stimulus and a ‘risk-on’ sentiment across global markets. Such an environment is precisely what could propel Bitcoin to the upper echelons of predictions, potentially sending its value soaring to an astonishing $300,000 to $500,000. Navigating the Crypto Market Forecast: Opportunities and Challenges While the crypto market forecast paints an incredibly optimistic picture, it’s crucial to approach these predictions with a balanced perspective. The potential for substantial gains is undeniable, but so are the inherent challenges and risks that characterize the volatile world of digital assets. Key Opportunities Driving the Forecast: Growing Institutional Interest: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has opened doors for traditional finance, bringing in significant capital and legitimacy. This institutional embrace is expected to continue, providing a stable foundation for future price appreciation. Increasing Utility and Adoption: Beyond its role as a store of value, Bitcoin’s underlying technology continues to evolve, with developments in scalability solutions and broader integration into payment systems. Global Economic Rebalancing: As nations grapple with inflation and debt, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive hedge against traditional financial instability. Potential Challenges and Risks: Regulatory Headwinds: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable legislation could introduce significant market uncertainty and impact the positive crypto market forecast . Market Volatility: Bitcoin is renowned for its dramatic price swings. While these can lead to massive gains, they also carry the risk of substantial losses. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events, technological exploits, or major geopolitical shifts could trigger sudden and sharp market downturns, disrupting even the most optimistic forecasts. Profit-Taking and Correction: Even in a strong bull market, healthy corrections are inevitable. As prices surge, early investors may take profits, leading to temporary pullbacks that can test investor conviction. Preparing for the Next Bitcoin Bull Run: Actionable Insights With the potential for an unprecedented Bitcoin bull run on the horizon, many investors are wondering how best to position themselves. While financial advice should always come from a qualified professional, here are some general actionable insights based on historical market behavior and common investment principles: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, thoroughly research Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Understand the technology, the market dynamics, and the risks involved. Relying solely on a single Bitcoin price prediction can be risky. Consider a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s history shows that its most significant gains are realized over multi-year cycles. Short-term volatility can be jarring, but a long-term ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) strategy has often proven effective for patient investors during past bull runs. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This strategy averages out your purchase price over time, mitigating the risk of buying at a peak and smoothing out volatility. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and avoid putting all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising it appears. A diversified approach helps mitigate risks associated with any single asset’s performance. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analyses, and macroeconomic developments. The crypto space evolves rapidly, and staying informed is key to making timely and informed decisions throughout the potential Bitcoin bull run . The audacious predictions of Bitcoin reaching $200,000, $300,000, or even an incredible $500,000 by year-end are certainly captivating. Driven by both robust technical indicators like the long-term power curve and favorable macroeconomic shifts, the stage appears set for a potentially historic Bitcoin bull run . While no prediction is guaranteed, the confluence of historical patterns and external catalysts provides a compelling narrative for Bitcoin’s continued ascent. As the crypto market continues to evolve, understanding these driving forces becomes paramount for anyone looking to navigate its complexities. Whether Bitcoin hits these exact targets or not, the underlying trends suggest a vibrant and dynamic future for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.

2025-07-12T12:00:57,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling the Surge to Extreme Greed","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling the Surge to Extreme Greed Are you feeling the buzz in the crypto air? The digital asset market is once again capturing headlines, and a key indicator, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , has just sent a powerful signal. Surging to a striking 79, this crucial metric has officially entered the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone. What does this dramatic shift mean for your portfolio, and more importantly, for the future trajectory of the crypto landscape? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, serves as a fascinating barometer for the prevailing mood in the cryptocurrency market. It’s designed to give investors a quick snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly fearful or excessively greedy. Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 denotes ‘Extreme Greed’, this index provides invaluable insights into collective investor psychology. Think of it as a temperature gauge for the market. When the needle points towards ‘Fear’, it often suggests that prices are low and potentially represent buying opportunities for the brave. Conversely, a move into ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ can indicate that the market might be overheated, possibly signaling a time for caution or profit-taking. The recent jump to 79, up eight points from the previous day, is a significant shift that demands our attention. How is This Powerful Index Calculated? The accuracy and relevance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stem from its sophisticated methodology, which aggregates data from six distinct market factors. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the overall score, ensuring a holistic view of market sentiment. Let’s break down these components: Volatility (25%): This factor measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates a fearful market, but rapid upward swings can also contribute to greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volumes and strong positive momentum typically signal a greedy market. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for specific keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency. A high volume of positive sentiment and engagement often correlates with rising greed. Surveys (15%): Historically, Alternative conducted weekly polls to gauge investor sentiment. However, it’s important to note that this factor is currently paused. When active, it provided direct insights into what individual investors were thinking. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is a key indicator. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear, as investors might be flocking to the perceived safety of BTC during uncertain times. Conversely, a falling dominance, with altcoins gaining traction, might indicate a more speculative, greedy market. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” might indicate fear, while terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “best altcoins to buy” could signal growing greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index provides a nuanced perspective on the collective psyche of crypto investors, helping to explain the current shift towards Extreme Greed . The Surge to Extreme Greed: What Does 79 Mean? A score of 79 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market firmly in the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory. This is a significant psychological milestone. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections or significant price pullbacks. It suggests that investors are becoming overly optimistic, potentially leading to irrational exuberance and speculative buying. When the market is gripped by Extreme Greed , it’s common to see phenomena such as: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): New investors, or those who have been on the sidelines, jump into the market, fearing they will miss out on further gains. High Leverage Trading: Traders take on increased risk, using borrowed funds to amplify their positions, betting on continued upward momentum. Ignoring Fundamentals: Less attention is paid to the underlying technology, adoption, or economic realities, with focus solely on price action. Rapid Price Increases: Assets, especially altcoins, can experience parabolic price movements, driven by speculative fervor rather than intrinsic value. While the immediate feeling might be euphoric, seasoned investors often view ‘Extreme Greed’ as a cautionary signal. It’s a time to review portfolios, consider taking profits, and prepare for potential shifts in the market dynamic. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: Why It’s Crucial for Your Strategy Understanding crypto market sentiment is paramount for any investor navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrencies are heavily influenced by psychological factors due to their relatively nascent stage and decentralized nature. The collective mood of participants can dictate short-term price movements more than fundamental analysis alone. When sentiment shifts from fear to greed, it typically fuels upward price momentum. Positive news, regulatory clarity, or even influential tweets can quickly turn the tide. Conversely, negative news, security breaches, or major sell-offs can plunge the market into fear. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a quantitative measure of this often-qualitative aspect, allowing investors to objectively assess the prevailing mood. Key aspects of market sentiment: Contrarian Indicator: Many use the index as a contrarian indicator: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” A high ‘Extreme Greed’ reading might suggest it’s time to be cautious. Market Cycles: Sentiment often moves in cycles, from despair to hope, then optimism, and finally euphoria (greed), followed by complacency, anxiety, denial, and panic (fear). Recognizing where the market is in this cycle can inform investment decisions. Impact on Adoption: Positive sentiment can attract new users and institutional investors, driving further adoption and potentially long-term growth. By closely monitoring crypto market sentiment , investors can avoid making emotional decisions and instead align their strategies with a more informed understanding of market psychology. The Impact on Bitcoin Price and Beyond: What’s Next? The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 79 has direct implications for the Bitcoin price and the broader altcoin market. As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin often sets the tone for the entire ecosystem. When the market enters ‘Extreme Greed’, Bitcoin typically experiences significant price pumps, attracting new capital and reinforcing the bullish narrative. For Bitcoin: Potential for Continued Upside: The immediate effect might be continued price appreciation as FOMO kicks in. Increased Volatility: While prices rise, volatility can also increase, leading to sharp corrections as traders take profits. Liquidation Risks: High leverage in a greedy market can lead to cascading liquidations if a sudden downturn occurs, amplifying price drops. For Altcoins: “Altcoin Season” Potential: When Bitcoin performs well, capital often flows into altcoins, leading to even more explosive gains for smaller cap assets. This is often a characteristic of an ‘Extreme Greed’ phase. Higher Risk/Reward: While altcoins offer higher potential returns during such periods, they also carry significantly higher risks due to their lower liquidity and greater sensitivity to market sentiment shifts. It’s crucial for investors to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. While ‘Extreme Greed’ can signal exciting times, it also calls for a disciplined approach to risk management, especially concerning your exposure to the Bitcoin price and other digital assets. Navigating Market Volatility: Strategies for Extreme Greed In a market defined by ‘Extreme Greed’ and surging market volatility , adopting a strategic approach is more critical than ever. While the allure of quick gains is strong, uncontrolled enthusiasm can lead to significant losses if the market suddenly reverses course. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these choppy waters: Don’t Chase Pumps: Resist the urge to buy into assets that have already experienced parabolic rises. These often lead to “bag holding” when corrections occur. Take Partial Profits: If your portfolio has seen significant gains, consider taking some profits off the table. This could mean selling a portion of your holdings to secure initial investment or a percentage of your gains. Reinvesting these profits into less volatile assets or stablecoins can be a wise move. Rebalance Your Portfolio: As some assets surge, they might disproportionately increase their weight in your portfolio. Rebalancing by selling some of the outperformers and reallocating to underperformers (or simply reducing overall exposure) can help maintain your desired risk level. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, setting stop-loss orders can limit potential losses if the market turns. This is particularly important in high-volatility environments. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on social media hype. Understand the fundamentals of the projects you invest in. During ‘Extreme Greed’, many low-quality projects can pump alongside legitimate ones. Maintain a Cash Position: Having some stablecoin or fiat reserves allows you to capitalize on potential dips or corrections, which are common even in bull markets. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between your long-term investment strategy and any short-term trading activities. Don’t let short-term greed compromise your long-term goals. Managing market volatility during periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ is about balancing optimism with prudence. It’s about being prepared for both continued upside and potential downturns. Benefits and Challenges of a High Greed Environment The current state of ‘Extreme Greed’, as indicated by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 79, presents both exciting opportunities and significant risks for investors. Understanding these dual aspects is key to making informed decisions. Benefits: Profit Potential: The most obvious benefit is the potential for rapid and substantial gains. Assets can appreciate quickly as more capital flows into the market. Increased Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and increased participation mean better liquidity, making it easier to buy and sell assets. Innovation and Adoption: Bull markets often spur greater interest in the underlying technology, attracting talent and fostering innovation within the crypto space. Mainstream Attention: High prices and positive sentiment draw mainstream media attention, which can further accelerate adoption and understanding of cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Increased Risk of Correction: The primary challenge is the heightened risk of a sharp market correction. When everyone is greedy, there are fewer buyers left, and a small trigger can lead to a significant sell-off. Irrational Exuberance: Investors may make decisions based on emotion rather than sound analysis, leading to poor investment choices in speculative assets. Scams and Rug Pulls: Periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ often see a proliferation of scams and fraudulent projects looking to capitalize on investor FOMO. Difficulty in Entry/Exit: For new investors, entering at peak greed can mean buying at inflated prices. For existing holders, knowing when to exit can be challenging due to the psychological pull of continued gains. Market Volatility: While opportunities exist, the inherent market volatility can lead to significant swings, requiring strong emotional discipline. Navigating this environment requires a balanced perspective, acknowledging the upside while remaining acutely aware of the inherent risks that come with pervasive Extreme Greed . Conclusion: Riding the Wave with Caution The surge of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 79, placing the market firmly in the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone, is a clear signal that optimism is currently at an all-time high. This improved crypto market sentiment has undeniably fueled the recent rally in Bitcoin price and the broader altcoin market, creating exciting opportunities for many. However, history has shown us that periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ are often inflection points. While the current momentum is strong, it’s also a time when market volatility can be at its peak, and irrational decisions are more likely to occur. As an investor, your goal should be to leverage the positive sentiment while safeguarding against potential downturns. By understanding how the index is calculated, recognizing the psychological drivers behind ‘Extreme Greed’, and implementing disciplined strategies like profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing, you can navigate this thrilling yet precarious phase of the crypto market with greater confidence. Stay informed, stay strategic, and always prioritize risk management. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

2025-07-12T11:59:08,"Why Pi Network Is Delaying KYC Approvals and Rewards","The post Why Pi Network Is Delaying KYC Approvals and Rewards appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After years of waiting, Pi Network has come a long way, but the journey isn’t over yet. While the foundation is mostly complete, the ecosystem still isn’t ready to fully support large-scale DApp use or economic activity. At the same time, many users are frustrated by delays in KYC approvals, migrations, and promised rewards. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dr Altcoin believes these delays might be part of a bigger plan to protect Pi’s future. Real Reason for the Hold-Up According to Dr Altcoin , the Pi Core Team (PCT) has finished most of the groundwork needed to run the network. It took them over six years to reach this point, but the project is not yet fully ready to handle large-scale DApps or true peer-to-peer transactions at a larger scale. Another important factor is the so-called “price discovery phase.” Right now, Pi Coin is still finding its true market price. The price has fallen from around $3 down to as low as $0.40 . Meanwhile, Dr Altcoin says the Pi Core Team wants to see Pi trading above $10 before allowing full peer-to-peer use. Until that happens, they’re holding off to avoid a market crash. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Pi Network Coin Price is Dropping , Strategic Delay to Prevent Mass Selling It’s no secret that many people are holding onto Pi just because of pending rewards, KYC approvals, and migration. If all those coins were released today, a huge number of users might immediately sell, causing a big drop in price and weakening the community. By delaying these, the team is buying time for Pi’s value to grow stronger. Dr Altcoin even hints that long-term token locking or burning some coins might be used in the future to push the price up. Playing the Long Game However, Dr Altcoin suggests that he’s focusing on the long run, believing Pi’s big promise will be worth it. If the plan works, the network could reach real peer-to-peer utility, stronger prices, and maybe help loyal holders achieve financial freedom. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to Dr. Altcoin, the Pi Core Team (PCT) has completed the network’s foundation but is delaying full DApp and peer-to-peer functionality because the ecosystem isn’t ready for large-scale use and Pi Coin hasn’t reached its target “price discovery phase” of over $10. What is the long-term vision for Pi Network? Dr. Altcoin believes the long-term plan aims for Pi Network to achieve real peer-to-peer utility, stronger prices, and potentially help loyal holders achieve financial freedom.

2025-07-12T11:56:13,"Financial Expert Sends Critical Warning to XRP Holders Amid Major Rally","As XRP continues to surge in value, private banker and financial strategist Sidney M Brewer has issued an impassioned warning to the XRP community: do not sell. In a video shared on X, Brewer emphasized that XRP is not merely a digital asset; it is the foundation of a coming financial revolution. His message comes as XRP trades at $2.84, having gained over 30% in the past 10 days, outperforming much of the altcoin market and even outpacing Bitcoin’s recent growth. With Bitcoin currently at $118,500.16, investor attention is once again shifting toward Ripple’s ecosystem. XRP’s Role in the New Financial System According to Brewer, the global financial structure is on the brink of transformation, with XRP playing a pivotal role in this shift. He argues that the legacy financial system, built on fiat currency and central bank control, is being phased out in favor of a tokenized, blockchain-driven future. XRP- Holders listen very carefully! This is bigger than you! DO NOT SELL! pic.twitter.com/IQpntaVfry — Sidney M Brewer (@SidneyMBrewer) July 11, 2025 “Cash is not king,” Brewer asserted. “Your promissory notes aren’t worth the paper or plastic they’re printed on. What’s coming down the pipeline is XRP.” Brewer claims his network of private banking institutions across Canada and the U.S. has spent the last two years preparing for this shift, establishing Special Purpose Corporations (SPCs) and private loan trust companies. Their goal is to create a parallel financial system that enables interest-free loans, replaces debt-based financing, and allows for the tokenization of assets on the blockchain. Why Selling XRP Could Be a Critical Mistake Brewer’s central message is a clear and urgent warning: under no circumstances should holders sell their XRP . He argues that doing so not only weakens the position of the XRP community but also hands control of the asset back to the very financial powers that have perpetuated global debt systems. “There are two sides to this game,” he explained. “On one side are the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and traditional central banks. On the other hand, our side is building a system to empower people. If you sell your XRP, you’re giving them control.” He urged every XRP holder to store a minimum of 10,000 XRP units in cold storage, insisting that those who do will be “grandfathered” into a new private trust system that allows for strategic leveraging of XRP without selling it. Brewer believes XRP should be used as collateral to access liquidity, rather than being cashed out for short-term gains. Education, Tokenization, and Long-Term Wealth Brewer highlighted the importance of education in this new economic era. He criticized retail investors for chasing profits without understanding the long-term implications of their actions. “They’ll think they’re rich, buy houses and cars, then get slammed with taxes and regret,” he said. “They don’t know how to play the game.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Brewer advocates for asset tokenization, where homes, businesses, and other assets are converted into digital tokens as a means to preserve and grow wealth. This approach would allow individuals to access value without selling assets, thereby avoiding traditional finance’s debt traps. A Warning for the Impatient As XRP approaches the critical $3.00 resistance level, Brewer warned that many will panic sell during short-term price spikes, only to lose out on the full potential of what’s to come. “You’re going to panic when it jumps a couple of bucks,” he said. “ But if you sell now, you’ll miss the transfer of wealth that’s coming, and your children will pay the price. ” With thousands of new millionaires expected to emerge in the coming weeks, Brewer’s final advice is resolute: “Even if you get a letter from God signed by Jesus and approved by Moses, do not sell. Hold your XRP outside the system. We got this.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-12T11:51:31,"Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 12 July, 2025","The post Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 12 July, 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s been a packed week in crypto. Ripple grabbed headlines again, Ethereum got a corporate boost, and the Fed may be facing a shake-up of its own. It’s a mix of regulation, big money, and even bigger signals about where the market could be headed. Here are the top stories you need to know. #1 Fed Chair Jerome Powell May Resign Jerome Powell may be preparing to step down as Chair of the Federal Reserve. Fannie Mae Chairman William Pulte said he’s “encouraged by reports” of Powell’s possible resignation, adding it would help the economy “boom.” The pressure has been building. President Trump has sharply criticised Powell’s refusal to cut rates, calling it a costly mistake, and saying he is “terrible”. Powell also faces accusations of misleading Congress over a $2.5 billion Fed renovation. Lawmakers are now calling for a formal investigation. A decision could impact both markets and crypto flows. #2 Justin Sun Commits $100M to Trump Memecoin Justin Sun plans to buy $100 million worth of Donald Trump’s memecoin, just days before a $474 million token unlock. The Tron founder made the announcement on X, calling it a step to “grow the crypto landscape with communities such as GetTrumpMemes.” The move comes as the token prepares to launch on the Tron blockchain. Sun’s history with Trump-linked projects runs deep – including over $90 million spent across earlier ventures. It’s still unclear whether the funds will come from him directly or through the Tron DAO. We are committed to buying $100M of $TRUMP ! Together, $TRUMP and #TRON are the future of Crypto. This move highlights our belief in collaborating across ecosystems to grow the crypto landscape with communities such as @GetTrumpMemes . $TRUMP on #TRON is the currency of #MAGA !… — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) July 9, 2025 #3 Ripple CEO Becomes One of Crypto’s Wealthiest Leaders Brad Garlinghouse is now among crypto’s richest figures, with an estimated net worth of $10 billion. The Ripple CEO’s equity and XRP holdings saw a sharp boost following Ripple’s partial legal win against the U.S. SEC. The company settled for $50 million – far less than the original demand. Garlinghouse, who has led Ripple since 2016, continues to push for crypto-friendly regulations and stronger global partnerships. #4 Musk Names Bitcoin in America Party Agenda Bitcoin gained fresh momentum after Elon Musk confirmed it will be part of his new America Party’s official platform. “Fiat is hopeless so yes,” he said when asked about supporting BTC, a remark that quickly pushed Bitcoin close to $110,000. Dogecoin also jumped 6%. The move follows Musk’s split from the Republican Party over Trump’s controversial $3.3 trillion tax bill. With Tesla still holding over 11,500 BTC, Musk’s stance adds new political weight to Bitcoin’s future in the U.S. #5 Japan’s Metaplanet to Use Bitcoin for Business Acquisitions Japan’s Metaplanet is entering the next phase of its Bitcoin strategy. After adding 2,205 BTC this week, the Tokyo-based company now holds 15,555 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder outside North America. Metaplanet will now use its Bitcoin holdings as collateral to finance acquisitions of profitable businesses. “We need to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can… to reach escape velocity,” said CEO Simon Gerovich. The company has set a bold target: 210,000 BTC by 2027. #6 WazirX, Binance Face Heat as FIU Flags Terror Finance Concerns India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is investigating Binance and WazirX over concerns that crypto transfers may be linked to cross-border terror financing. The focus is on unhosted wallets possibly connected to Pakistan, with increased activity flagged in sensitive regions like Jammu & Kashmir. Binance is cooperating with authorities, a year after settling a ₹18 crore penalty to resume operations in India. WazirX is also under scrutiny, with an upcoming Singapore court hearing and claims that TRX tokens may have been used to fund ISIS-linked activity. #7 Ripple Picks Top U.S. Bank to Strengthen RLUSD Trust Ripple has partnered with BNY Mellon to custody reserves for its stablecoin, RLUSD – a move that boosts regulatory credibility and institutional trust. The announcement came as RLUSD crosses a $500 million market cap just seven months after launch. BNY Mellon will handle reserve assets like cash and U.S. Treasuries. “We are thrilled to support the growth and adoption of RLUSD,” said BNY Mellon’s Emily Portney. Ripple is also pursuing a U.S. banking charter and Fed master account. #8 Nasdaq Firm Goes All-In on Ethereum, Dumps BTC Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-listed firm, has sold off all 280 of its Bitcoin to build a massive Ethereum treasury. After raising $172 million in a public offering, the company now holds over 100,600 ETH, aiming to become the largest corporate holder of Ether. CEO Sam Tabar said the move reflects Ethereum’s long-term value, citing smart contracts and staking rewards. Bit Digital’s stock jumped nearly 18%, as markets responded to the strategy. #9 TON’s Viral Golden Visa Pitch Got Denied by UAE Toncoin surged nearly 12% after TON Foundation’s CEO claimed that staking $100,000 worth of the token could get investors a UAE Golden Visa. But UAE authorities quickly denied it. The country’s top regulators – ICP, SCA, and VARA – issued a joint statement calling the claim false, clarifying that TON is not licensed or approved in Dubai. No such visa route exists for crypto investors. #10 Tokenized Securities Still Count as Securities, Says SEC SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” has warned that tokenizing assets doesn’t change their legal status. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” she said. Her comments come amid rising interest in blockchain-based stocks, with firms like Coinbase seeking approval to offer tokenized equities. Peirce also flagged risks tied to third-party tokens, saying buyers could face added legal and financial uncertainty. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! South Korea to Grant Crypto Startups Venture Status: A new government proposal could give digital asset firms access to tax breaks, funding, and loan guarantees for the first time under the national venture ecosystem. New Zealand Bans Crypto ATMs in Money Laundering Crackdown: Authorities halt 220+ crypto kiosks and limit overseas transfers to $5,000, aiming to tighten controls on illicit fund flows and boost financial crime enforcement. Trump Media Files for ‘Crypto Blue Chip ETF’ with SEC : The proposed fund would track five major tokens including Solana and XRP, with Crypto.com set to serve as digital custodian if approved. Hong Kong’s Stablecoin License Race Draws 40+ Global Players: Top firms like JD.com, Ant Group, and Circle are competing for fewer than 10 stablecoin licenses as Hong Kong rolls out its new digital asset regime this August. Tether CEO Says “We Will Be the Largest Bitcoin Miner by End of 2025”: The USDT issuer is expanding fast with 15+ sites across Latin America, betting big on mining to protect its reserves and meet stricter stablecoin rules under the GENIUS Act. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead Bitcoin could see fresh institutional flows as political endorsements stack up, from Musk’s America Party platform to Japan’s Metaplanet doubling down on BTC-backed acquisitions. Ripple’s stablecoin ambitions may accelerate now that BNY Mellon is on board. With a $500M cap hit and U.S. bank charter in progress, RLUSD could push deeper into regulated finance. Ethereum’s corporate appeal is gaining ground, as Bit Digital ditches BTC for ETH to bet on staking and smart contracts. Tokenization efforts may face more resistance after SEC’s Hester Peirce reaffirmed that digital wrappers don’t dodge securities laws. Platforms like Coinbase will need sharper legal strategies. Memecoins may blur lines between community hype and political narrative, as Justin Sun’s $100M pledge to Trump’s token raises new questions. Stablecoin compliance will tighten globally with new acts coming into play That’s it from me this week.

Is it same like Crypto Purpose? 8 Key Uses Explained Beyond Investment For many, the term “crypto” immediately brings to mind images of volatile charts and high-risk investments. While its role as an investment vehicle is significant, the true crypto purpose extends far beyond speculation. Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary technology with a multifaceted mission to reshape finance, enhance privacy, and provide access to a global digital economy. This article delves into the core functions of cryptocurrency, moving past the hype to explore its fundamental uses. From acting as a new form of money to empowering the unbanked, we will unpack the eight key purposes of crypto and also address the critical risks that every user must understand. Table of Contents What is Cryptocurrency? A Quick Refresher The Core Crypto Purpose: 8 Key Functions Unpacked Navigating the Risks: The Critical Considerations of Crypto Conclusion: A Technology of Potential and Prudence Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is Cryptocurrency? A Quick Refresher Before diving into its purpose, let’s clarify what “crypto” is. Short for cryptocurrency, it’s a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (like the U.S. Dollar or the Indian Rupee), crypto operates on a decentralized system called a blockchain. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, was the first, but thousands of others, known as “altcoins,” have since been created. Each has unique features, but they all share the foundational principle of operating independently from a central bank or single authority. The Core Crypto Purpose ( crypto pur ): 8 Key Functions Unpacked Understanding the true crypto purpose requires looking at its diverse applications. Here are eight of its most important functions: 1. A Modern Medium of Exchange At its most basic level, crypto is designed to be a form of digital cash. It can be used to purchase goods and services online and, increasingly, at physical stores. This peer-to-peer system allows value to be transferred directly from one person to another without needing a bank to process the transaction. 2. A High-Growth Investment Vehicle This is the most well-known use. Many people buy cryptocurrencies hoping their value will appreciate significantly over time. While highly volatile, the potential for high returns has attracted millions of investors worldwide, making crypto a prominent, albeit risky, asset class. 3. A Tool for Global Financial Inclusion Billions of people worldwide lack access to traditional banking services. The only requirements to use crypto are an internet connection and a digital wallet. This opens the door for underserved populations to participate in the global financial system, save money, and make transactions securely. 4. Faster & Cheaper Global Transactions Traditional international bank transfers can take 3-5 business days and often involve high fees. Cryptocurrency transactions can be settled in minutes, regardless of geography, and typically at a fraction of the cost. This makes it a powerful tool for remittances and international trade. 5. Power Through Decentralization Because cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any single government or company, they offer users a degree of financial autonomy. This decentralization makes the network resistant to censorship or manipulation by a central authority, a key philosophical pillar of the crypto movement. For more on this, major financial publications like Forbes often discuss the implications of decentralization. 6. A Potential Hedge Against Inflation Some cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, have a fixed supply limit. For Bitcoin, only 21 million coins will ever exist. This scarcity leads some investors to believe it can act as a “digital gold”—a store of value that is resistant to inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of traditional, government-issued currencies. 7. Radical Transparency with Blockchain Most cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology, which is a public, distributed ledger. Every transaction is recorded on this ledger and is visible to anyone. This transparency can help prevent fraud and corruption, as all movements of funds are open for public scrutiny. 8. Enhanced User Privacy While all transactions are public, the identities of the parties involved are pseudonymous—represented by a cryptographic wallet address, not personal information. This provides a layer of privacy that is often greater than traditional banking systems, where personal data is collected and stored by a central institution. Navigating the Risks: The Critical Considerations of Crypto No discussion of the crypto purpose is complete without addressing its significant risks. Before engaging with digital assets, it’s crucial to be aware of the following: Extreme Volatility: Prices can and do fluctuate dramatically in very short periods. It’s not uncommon for a cryptocurrency’s value to swing by over 10% in a single day. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments around the world are still deciding how to regulate cryptocurrencies. New laws could significantly impact their value and legality. Security Risks: If you lose your private keys (the password to your digital wallet), you lose access to your funds forever. Hacking of exchanges and scams are also prevalent threats. Environmental Impact: The “mining” process for some major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, is energy-intensive and has raised significant environmental concerns. If you are considering investing, it is essential to conduct thorough research. You can [ read our detailed guide on “How to Invest in Cryptocurrency Safely” ]([Internal Link Placeholder]) to learn more. Conclusion: A Technology of Potential and Prudence The purpose of crypto is rich and varied. It is simultaneously a new financial system, an investment asset, a political statement about decentralization, and a practical tool for global transactions. Its potential to reshape our digital world is immense, but it is accompanied by equally significant risks. Understanding both sides of this powerful technology is the first step toward navigating its landscape safely and effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is the main purpose of cryptocurrency? The main purpose of cryptocurrency is to act as a secure, decentralized digital currency that can be used for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority like a bank. It also serves as an investment asset and a tool for financial inclusion. Is crypto only for investment? No. While many people use crypto for investment, its core functions include acting as a medium of exchange for goods and services, enabling cheaper and faster international remittances, and providing financial services to those without access to traditional banks. What are the biggest risks of using crypto? The biggest risks include extreme price volatility, the potential for total loss of funds through security breaches or losing private keys, and an uncertain regulatory environment where new laws could negatively impact the market. How does crypto provide privacy? Crypto provides privacy through pseudonymity. While transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, they are tied to a cryptographic address, not a person’s real-world identity. This makes it more private than traditional banking, which requires sharing personal information. This post What is crypto pur?

2025-07-12T11:35:38,"Crypto Investor Ryan Sean Adams Calls Ethereum the Next World Reserve Asset","The post Crypto Investor Ryan Sean Adams Calls Ethereum the Next World Reserve Asset appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has finally broken above the key $2,850 resistance level , jumping 15% this week to trade around $2,955. The move has stirred fresh excitement across the altcoin market, with rising trading volume hinting that a new altseason might be underway – a period where altcoins outperform Bitcoin and deliver bigger gains. With Ethereum reclaiming major technical levels and a strong new narrative building, many investors are starting to ask: Is ETH stepping into a much bigger role in the global financial system? “Blue Money” Revolution: Ethereum’s Bold Rebrand Ryan Sean Adams, founder of Mythos Capital, is one of the most vocal supporters of Ethereum’s evolving identity. In a recent post on X, he credited the community’s efforts: “The ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months.” Adams’ “blue money” concept recasts Ethereum not just as infrastructure for decentralized apps , but as a yield-generating, store-of-value asset backed by a real on-chain economy. While Bitcoin is seen as digital gold and oil remains a classic store of value, ETH offers something more – security and productivity. His big idea? Ethereum has the potential to become a global reserve asset and that’s now catching the attention of both retail and institutional investors. The ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months. We are emphasizing ETH the asset now. A store of value like gold, oil, and bitcoin – but backed by an economy with yield. It's made a huge difference. Keep going. ETH = world reserve asset https://t.co/e9GD4YeKNQ — RYAN SΞAN ADAMS – rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) July 11, 2025 Breaking Out: ETH Regains Key Support Zones After weeks of moving sideways, ETH has broken through with strength, reclaiming both the 100-week and 200-week moving averages , currently sitting at $2,644 and $2,428. This kind of technical reclaim often signals that a downtrend could be over and a new bullish phase is beginning. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 12 July, 2025 , The $2,850 level has long been a major zone of resistance and support. With ETH now trading above it, analysts are eyeing the next targets at $3,300 to $3,600. If momentum holds, a push toward $4,000 is well within reach. Despite this progress, ETH is still trading about 60% below its all-time high of nearly $4,900 from November 2021, leaving plenty of room for upside if this rally continues. Ethereum’s Comeback Opportunity Since 2022, Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin, frustrating many holders. While BTC has hit fresh all-time highs, ETH is still playing catch-up. But that underperformance is now being seen as a potential opportunity. Adams believes the market is starting to take a fresh look at ETH. “We are emphasizing ETH, the asset now,” he wrote on X, urging the community to keep building on this momentum. If the idea of Ethereum as a reserve asset gains wider support, it could help ETH close the gap with Bitcoin and even shift the balance of power across the crypto market. Altcoins Follow Ethereum’s Lead Ethereum’s breakout is lifting the rest of the altcoin market too, with several tokens showing strong gains in its wake. This kind of broad move often signals confidence returning to riskier parts of the market and positions ETH as the trendsetter for the altcoin space. Still, the rally isn’t without risk. If ETH drops back below $2,850, the recent momentum could fade, and lower support levels may be tested again. But for now, Ethereum is leading the charge. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

How is Ethereum’s rally impacting the broader altcoin market? Ethereum’s breakout is leading the broader altcoin market, with several other tokens showing strong gains in its wake. This signals returning confidence to riskier assets and positions ETH as a key trendsetter for altcoins. Is Ethereum a good investment?

2025-07-12T11:29:38,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC At Record Levels As It Heads Into Crucial “Crypto Week”","Bitcoin (BTC) set a fresh record on Friday, surging to $118,856 as the flagship cryptocurrency’s record-breaking rally continues. BTC bulls have set their eyes on the $120,000 mark as the flagship cryptocurrency heads into a crucial week with the price at record levels. Price action has slowed down over the past 24 hours, with the price marginally down, trading around $118,139. Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Triggers $1.2 billion in Liquidations Bitcoin’s (BTC) record-breaking rally has led to over $1 billion in bearish positions liquidated over the past 24 hours. Over 279,000 traders were liquidated as the flagship cryptocurrency raced to its latest all-time high. According to data from Coinglass, the largest liquidation, valued at around $88 million, occurred on HTX. Augustine Fan, partner at crypto trading platform SignalPlus, stated, “The conditions for a slow grind higher have been in place for some time. Today’s move appears to be a product of that setup.” Bitcoin was trading in a tight range since May but broke out of it on Thursday after President Trump unleashed his latest trade salvo, sending stocks into a tizzy. BTC crossed $115,000 by Thursday and surged past $118,000 on Friday as bullish sentiment returned to crypto. Several factors are fueling the latest rally, including record ETF inflows and a Congressional committee declaring next week as “Crypto Week.” There are also indications that China is rethinking its stance on digital assets. A Crucial Week For Bitcoin (BTC) And Crypto Bitcoin (BTC) heads into a landmark week for the crypto industry, with the US House of Representatives set to discuss three crucial crypto bills, which could provide much-needed regulatory clarity. Lawmakers will discuss the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, with signs that recently strained ties between Washington and the crypto industry are beginning to thaw. A regulatory framework could encourage companies to adopt Bitcoin into their treasury strategy, following the lead set by firms like Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR). The GENIUS Act will allow private companies to issue stablecoins. President Trump has already announced his support for the bill on social media. Meanwhile, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act will establish a framework for crypto regulation. The third bill, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Investors are lining up to take positions ahead of next week. Analysts expect that capital previously sidelined due to regulatory uncertainty will re-enter the market. Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex, believes even if the final passage of the bills stalls, the optics of legislative engagement could push the market higher. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) reached new highs on three consecutive days, with the flagship cryptocurrency’s market dominance sitting around 64%, down 1.53% over the past week. However, altcoins also registered significant price jumps as BTC reached record levels, with Ethereum (ETH) reclaiming $3,000 and Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) breaking past key levels. With Bitcoin dominance remaining steady, analysts believe fresh capital is flowing into the wider market, helping prominent altcoins gain market share. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping 1.09% on Monday and 1.33% on Tuesday to settle at $105,740. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,637, ultimately registering an increase of 0.73%. It lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.41% and settling at $108,097.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. Amidst the bullish turn of events, as Bitcoin rose to a new ATH, the SOL price is also making positive moves. Moreover, Robinhood’s U.S. staking launch continues to push Solana. Talking about numbers, it is currently changing hands at $162.77 with an intraday drop of 0.7%.

We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world.

The RSI at 61.62 shows growing strength but not yet overbought. Increased volume (+36.32%) and a breakout from consolidation hint at renewed investor interest. With the $166.56 resistance now tested, SOL could trend higher if momentum holds. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $145 $170 $195 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.94 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $750M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

With prices now hovering near record highs, still, analysts are eyeing more gains towards the $135 target. It seems the BTC market is gearing up for a massive shift. Keep reading to know why. Long-Term Holders Absorb Supply: Bullish Pressure Intensifies According to a recent Glassnode post on X it reveals that the Bitcoin balance on exchanges is continuing to decline. This indicates towards the trend largely attributed to long-term holders absorbing more BTC than what miners are issuing. This means that less BTC is available for trading, tightening supply and laying the groundwork for upward price pressure. “ #BTC balance on exchanges dropping = supply shock” is a meme. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t supply constraints – long-term holders are absorbing more $BTC than miners issue. That’s where pressure builds. pic.twitter.com/OZtboXM0BM — glassnode (@glassnode) July 12, 2025 This behavior shows growing conviction among holders who are less likely to sell in the short term and it is directly seen as a bullish case. Analysts Turn Ultra-Bullish: $135K in Sight? Adding fuel to the fire, popular crypto analyst MisterCrypto has pointed out that Bitcoin is breaking out of a classic bull flag pattern, which traditionally signals continuation of an uptrend.

2025-07-12T11:06:06,"Bitcoin Investors Favor Accumulation Over Distribution Amid Price Surge: Glassnode","In the past two months, Bitcoin investors have favored accumulation over distribution. BTC’s price movement this week did not change that. Despite the asset hitting new highs this week, there is still a supply crunch, indicating that investors would rather accumulate than distribute their holdings. The market research firm Glassnode reported that these investor moves suggest they see current prices as offering relatively compelling value. Bitcoin Investors Are Accumulating Analyzing the raw Accumulation Trend Score, Glassnode discovered that this intense accumulation wave emerged when BTC first rallied past $100,000. After the breakout, investors gradually began to distribute more, and this gave way to stalled price action for a while. Following the all-time high (ATH) of over $111,000 in May, BTC saw renewed accumulation pressures, which have remained elevated since then. The accumulation metric hovered above its historical average even as BTC sat through an extended consolidation phase. It is still above the average. “This suggests that investors increasingly see the current range as a more favorable environment, despite price conditions being similar to those during the previous distribution phase in late-2024,” Glassnode said. Long-term Holder Supply Grows The persistent accumulation among investors is evident in the growing long-term holder (LTH) BTC supply. Evaluating the 30-day growth in LTH supply, Glassnode discovered that accumulation by this investor cohort is outpacing the monthly coin issuance. Miners are producing about 13,400 BTC monthly, but LTHs are increasing their balances at a pace of 19,300 BTC per month. Bitcoin investors holding less than 100 BTC are also in accumulation mode. The cohorts, categorized into Shrimps ( This accumulation trend suggests that supply-side conditions are tightening, with LTHs absorbing newly issued supply at a fast pace. Glassnode noted that these investors have become price-insensitive as they accumulate and are unwilling to distribute their assets at current market prices. Analysts believe they are waiting for more meaningful market action before they start distributing. Meanwhile, on-chain and derivatives market indicators are flashing signals of elevated volatility in the coming weeks. The supply-side tightening has made the market susceptible to demand shocks, and moderate fluctuations can trigger significant price volatility. Glassnode said the coiling and compression of prices across multiple timeframes support this observation.

2025-07-12T11:03:29,"XRP Price Could Jump to $4 While You Sleep This Week, Says Crypto Analyst","The post XRP Price Could Jump to $4 While You Sleep This Week, Says Crypto Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is back in the spotlight this week after a strong rally pushed its price to $2.77, up more than 7% in the last 24 hours. The token briefly touched $2.96 earlier today, its highest level in four months and now, market watchers say the next big move may come fast. “Don’t be surprised if you wake up randomly this week and $XRP is $4+,” said crypto analyst Edoardo Farina, hinting at a potential breakout that could push XRP past its 2018 all-time high of $3.84. If that happens, XRP would gain nearly 50% from current levels. It’s a bold call, but one that’s gaining support as momentum builds across the broader crypto market . Don’t be surprised if you wake up randomly this week and $XRP is $4+ — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 12, 2025 XRP Surges While Altcoin Season Hasn’t Even Started Despite the rally, most analysts agree that altcoin season hasn’t officially begun. The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 28 out of 100, suggesting Bitcoin is still leading the market . That makes XRP’s current 25% weekly gain even more notable. If this is how it’s performing before the altcoin wave hits, many believe the upside could be much higher once the full cycle kicks in. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Is Driving Fresh Optimism Adding to the excitement is Ripple’s recent progress with RLUSD, its new stablecoin. Last week, Ripple named BNY Mellon , the oldest U.S. bank, as the official custodian for RLUSD reserves. Ripple is also working to secure a national bank license and a Federal Reserve master account, which could give RLUSD a major advantage in the regulated stablecoin space. RLUSD has now crossed $500 million in market cap, becoming the eighth-largest stablecoin, and it runs on the XRP Ledger. Since XRP is used to pay transaction fees, this is directly boosting its utility. ETF Launches Coming This Month The XRP rally is also being powered by ETF developments. Several futures-based XRP ETFs are set to launch in July: ProShares will release three products by July 14 Turtle Capital’s 2x Long XRP ETF launches on July 21 Volatility Shares also plans to debut two XRP ETFs the same day At the same time, over 10 spot ETF applications are still under review by the SEC. While none have been approved yet, the growing interest is pushing confidence higher. Whale Activity Hits Record Levels Behind the scenes, XRP whales are making big moves. Data from Santiment shows there are now 2,742 wallets holding at least 1 million XRP, just one wallet short of the all-time high. Together, these large holders now control over 47.32 billion XRP, which is a sign of rising long-term confidence in the token. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Takes Aim at $685B Remittance Market , “Going All-In on XRP Should Be a Priority,” Says Analyst Well-known crypto commentator Oscar Ramos says investors shouldn’t take this momentum lightly.

This is an interesting one to follow! FAQs Why is XRP’s price up today? XRP’s price is up today due to a combination of factors: it has broken key technical resistance levels, optimism surrounding Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, upcoming XRP ETF launches in July, and significant accumulation by large XRP holders (whales). What role does Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin play in XRP’s momentum? Ripple’s new RLUSD stablecoin (custodied by BNY Mellon and nearing a national bank license) has a market cap over $500 million. As RLUSD uses the XRP Ledger for fees, its growth directly boosts XRP’s utility and optimism. Is altcoin season confirmed with XRP’s current rally? No, most analysts agree altcoin season hasn’t officially begun. The Altcoin Season Index is at 28/100, indicating Bitcoin is still leading. XRP’s strong performance before altseason makes its current rally particularly notable.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-could-jump-to-4-while-you-sleep-this-week-says-crypto-analyst/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|FIAT|BTC","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-12T11:00:48,"Revolutionary AI Robots: Hugging Face’s Reachy Mini Achieves Surprising Success","BitcoinWorld Revolutionary AI Robots: Hugging Face’s Reachy Mini Achieves Surprising Success In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence and robotics, where every new device promises groundbreaking functionality, a peculiar yet captivating innovation has emerged from Hugging Face.

The Charm of Reachy Mini: Hugging Face’s Unconventional Approach Hugging Face, a name synonymous with open-source AI models and tools, has taken an unexpected leap into physical products with the launch of its programmable Reachy Mini bots. These aren’t your typical sophisticated industrial robots. Instead, they are open-source, powered by Raspberry Pi, and adorned with charmingly cartoonish antennae and big googly eyes. Their initial appeal lies precisely in what they don’t do out of the box. As Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast hosts Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha discussed, the Reachy Mini embodies the ‘Seinfeld of AI hardware’ – doing nothing in particular, yet captivating an audience. This unconventional design choice, combined with their open-source nature, suggests a deliberate strategy. Instead of a highly specialized tool, Hugging Face is offering a versatile platform. This approach encourages creativity and community-driven development, allowing users to program the robots for diverse tasks.

2025-07-12T10:53:19,"Crypto Analyst: Altcoins Rally Strongly While Bitcoin Dominance Remains Unshaken","Despite Bitcoin maintaining a steady grip on the market, many altcoins are experiencing significant price surges, suggesting ample room for further upside in the broader crypto market. Key Takeaways: Altcoins are rallying strongly alongside Bitcoin, despite Bitcoin’s dominance at 64%. The usual signal for an altseason, a drop in Bitcoin dominance, is absent. However, analysts indicate the altcoin season is underway. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland noted on X that “BTC dominance hasn’t even sneezed and Alts are ripping,” highlighting the recent momentum in altcoins alongside Bitcoin’s steady dominance. At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 64.46%, down just 1.53% over the past week, even as Bitcoin climbed to new all-time highs — reaching $118,760 on Friday. Declining Bitcoin Dominance Typically Signals Start of Altseason Traditionally, a decline in Bitcoin dominance signals the start of an “altseason,” where altcoins gain market share. However, the current surge in altcoins without a significant drop in Bitcoin dominance may indicate fresh capital flowing into the entire crypto ecosystem rather than a shift away from Bitcoin. Among the top performers over the past week, MemeCore (M) led with a staggering 1,263% rally, followed by Mog Coin (MOG) up 75% and Stellar (XLM) rising 67%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, increased by 17.68% over the same period, with the ETH/BTC ratio climbing 8.39%, reinforcing traders’ expectations of a growing focus on altcoins. However, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index still reads “Bitcoin Season,” with a score of 29 out of 100, indicating that Bitcoin remains the dominant market driver. Yet, traders like Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, believe the market is approaching the “final easy and biggest bull ever on Altcoins.” “Trading Altcoins is difficult, that’s why the downwards corrections are extremely challenging and the upwards returns enormous,” he said. Cases like $OMNI are basically the reason why I tend to be into positions early. Especially if I'm willing to go full risk-on (I assume that we're about to witness the final easy and biggest bull ever on #Altcoins ), then I'd rather want to be early than buying after such a move.… — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 11, 2025 Data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment also supports this view, confirming that altcoin season has started. Santiment added that as long as Bitcoin holds above key psychological support near $110,000, traders will likely continue reallocating profits into altcoins, fueling further growth in the broader crypto market. Bitcoin Surpasses Silver in Market Cap Bitcoin’s market capitalization has surged past silver’s, reaching $2.34 trillion after the cryptocurrency hit a fresh all-time high above $118,000. The milestone places Bitcoin sixth among the world’s largest assets , surpassing silver’s $2.16 trillion market cap, according to Companies Market Cap data. Bitcoin is closing in on the top five assets, with Amazon’s $2.37 trillion market cap now within reach. Behind Bitcoin and silver are tech giants Google and Meta, valued at $1.15 trillion and $1.79 trillion, respectively. However, gold remains the dominant asset with a massive $22.6 trillion market cap. NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple follow, holding market caps in the $3 to $4 trillion range, well ahead of Bitcoin for now. Institutional demand has been a key driver, supporting Bitcoin’s consolidation above $100,000 before its recent price surge. Mercuryo CEO Petr Kozyakov noted that institutional interest continues to push Bitcoin’s value higher, underscoring its rising appeal as a store of value alongside altcoins like Ethereum, which recently surpassed $3,000.

2025-07-12T10:49:24,"Is Silver a Better Financial Instrument than Bitcoin? Peter Schiff Slams Critics","Bitcoin breaks new highs, but Silver’s steady rise attracts investors, citing a safe bet. Silver hits highest level since 2011, trailing Bitcoin’s rally but with less risk. Peter Schiff urges Bitcoin investors to shift to Silver, calling it a safer hedge with upside. As Bitcoin makes another remarkable feat of pushing to $118K, a debate has re-emerged among market observers over the merits of traditional assets with digital ones. With the king of crypto steadily progressing, a metal had also caught the attention of investors, but it is not gold this time. Silver, the often overlooked precious metal, had hit its highest, prompting analysts to suggest it’s time for investors to rebalance. Sharing tweets on X for two consecutive days, Peter Schiff stated that BTC investors could sell some of the asset and buy the metal. Following the thread on the following day, Schiff slammed investors for ignoring the price breakout of Silver. Notably, the price of Silver had gained around 4.3% over the past five days, reaching about $38.38 per ounce on Saturday during the early European trading session. Meanwhile, Bitcoin gained around 9% over the past week, moving t… The post Is Silver a Better Financial Instrument than Bitcoin?

2025-07-12T10:40:19,"Pundit Says Selling Your XRP at $10 Will Be a Once-in-a-Lifetime Mistake","Prominent crypto founder Edoardo Farina has warned XRP investors against exiting too early, as XRP prepares for the moon. In a recent tweet , Farina asserted that selling XRP at $10 could be a catastrophic mistake. Essentially, his argument infers that many investors may lock in short-term profits without realizing how much higher the asset could climb in upcoming market cycles.According to Farina, exiting the market at $10 may lead to long-term regret. This could be true, especially if XRP fulfills its potential during the next phase of adoption and institutional integration. Edoardo Farina on X Edoardo Farina on X Currently, XRP is trading at $2.44, and it still faces a formidable journey before reaching heights like $10. Yet, some XRP proponents are already warning against selling at a price that, while not guaranteed, may still be far below its ultimate potential.Lifetime Regret from Selling XRP Too EarlyFarina's perspective draws on the psychological impact of selling too soon, a mistake that has historically locked many investors out of significant gains.For instance, when XRP broke out in November 2024 and surpassed $1 for the first time in over three years, some expected a retracement to $0.50. But that pullback never came. The coin soon hit $2, and those who sold at $1 were left in regret.Looking further into XRP’s history, the coin has achieved significant milestones, many of which early sellers may now regret missing out on. Since early 2017, XRP has erased two zeros from its price, and today, investors can only buy it at unit prices far higher than its early days.Taking Inspiration from Bitcoin HoldersA similar pattern is evident with Bitcoin. It once traded under $0.05, and although those who sold at $10 made massive profits at the time, many likely regret that decision now, with Bitcoin trading over $117,000.Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) recently shared a personal reflection on this. Despite buying Bitcoin at $600 in 2013, CZ says he still feels behind compared to early adopters who bought in at just $0.10. His comments come as several early Bitcoin holders have recently emerged after over a decade of dormancy to cash out billions in BTC acquired below $1.https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1941293675331584290Essentially, prominent XRP commentators are urging today’s investors to remain patient. They believe XRP’s future may mirror the long-term success seen by early Bitcoin adopters. As such, they warn that selling at $10, despite representing a 300% gain from current levels, may become a regretful decision in hindsight.What Experts Say About XRP’s Future Price PotentialLofty price predictions circulating within the XRP community include targets of $100, $1,000, and even $10,000.For example, Farina has previously stated that he plans to take some profits when XRP surpasses $100. Analysts like Javon Marks have predicted that XRP could reach $100 during this market cycle, possibly by 2025 or 2026. However, many market watchers remain skeptical of these projections.Meanwhile, crypto analyst Matthew Brienen believes XRP could reach $1,000 by 2035. If that 10-year outlook materializes, today’s patient holders could see a staggering 40,700% gain, compared to just 300% from a $10 exit.An even more audacious projection comes from crypto founder Jake Claver. In a viral video, Claver claimed he expects XRP to trade at $10,000 per coin by 2027, driven by its efficiency in global payments.Ultimately, while some traders may view $10 as a reasonable point to take profits, voices like Farina’s advocate for a longer-term perspective, still, others argue it’s better to secure profits while they’re available rather than gamble on a future that may never materialize.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/12/pundit-says-selling-your-xrp-at-10-will-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-mistake/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-says-selling-your-xrp-at-10-will-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-mistake,"XRP|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-07-12T10:30:45,"Bitcoin Dominance Continues Historic Climb – Altcoins Struggle To Gain Ground","Bitcoin has officially entered a new chapter in its bull market, surging to fresh all-time highs near $118,800 after weeks of tight consolidation. This decisive breakout marks a pivotal shift in momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential explosive leg higher as bullish sentiment returns. The move above previous highs has not only reignited interest in BTC but also fueled optimism across the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 – Price Magnet Forming One of the most telling indicators of the current cycle’s strength is Bitcoin Dominance. According to top analyst On-Chain Mind, BTC dominance has climbed to 65% since the beginning of this bull market. This sharp increase highlights a clear preference among investors for Bitcoin over altcoins, solidifying its position as the market’s anchor in times of volatility and growth. As Bitcoin leads the charge, market watchers believe the breakout could trigger a wave of institutional inflows and renewed attention from sidelined retail investors. With momentum building and confidence growing, the breakout above $118K may just be the start of an even larger move, one that could define the next phase of the 2025 crypto bull cycle. Bitcoin Leads The Charge After weeks of sideways consolidation below the $110,000 mark, Bitcoin has finally broken out, launching a new bullish phase and pushing the broader crypto market into motion. Altcoins, which had lagged in recent months, are now climbing above key resistance levels as confidence spreads. This coordinated move comes amid a backdrop of macroeconomic shifts, with market participants increasingly anticipating a weakening US dollar and the return of inflationary policies under US President Donald Trump’s administration. With expectations of rate cuts looming and pressure mounting on the Federal Reserve, the market sees crypto—especially Bitcoin—as a natural hedge. However, caution still lingers. US Treasury yields remain elevated, continuing to flash warnings of systemic stress in the traditional financial system. That tension has only strengthened Bitcoin’s appeal as a non-sovereign, hard-capped monetary asset. Bitcoin dominance tells the story clearly. “At the start of this bull market, it sat at 40%. Today? 65%,” noted On-Chain Mind, emphasizing how investor preference has overwhelmingly leaned toward BTC. This dominance reflects a trend that has barely flinched, even as Ethereum and other altcoins attempt to catch up. As BTC leads the market higher, its dominance reinforces its role as the primary beneficiary of macro uncertainty. While the altcoin space is beginning to show signs of life, it’s clear that Bitcoin remains the anchor, and investors aren’t ready to rotate just yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Oscillator Predicts First Sell Pressure Level At $130,900 – Details 4‑Hour Chart: Post‑Breakout Cooling Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart shows a clean breakout followed by consolidation, a typical sign of strength after an impulsive move. Price surged from the long-standing resistance at $109,300 to a local high of $118,000 in less than twelve hours, marking an 8% rally. This breakout flipped prior resistance into support and triggered strong volume, validating the move. Volume has decreased during this period, which is characteristic of a bullish consolidation rather than distribution. The 50-period moving average (blue) has crossed above the 100-period (green), forming a short-term golden cross near $109K. This crossover supports a bullish outlook, with the 200-period moving average (red) trending upward from $105K, reinforcing the structure of higher lows. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level – Relief Or Reversal? As long as Bitcoin remains above $112K, bulls are firmly in control.

2025-07-12T10:27:17,"XRP Price Prediction: Investors on High Alert for July 14, 21, 25 – What’s Next for XRP?","XRP price has broken $2.80 as optimism around ETFs grows. The market is watching three key dates, July 14, 21, and 25, which could open up institutional access to XRP. The coin is up 7% in the last 24 hours on ETF speculation and broader crypto strength. It all started when ProShares announced they would be launching three XRP futures ETFs—Ultra XRP, UltraShort XRP, and Short XRP—on July 14. These products will allow both bulls and bears to get leveraged exposure to Ripple. ""XRP ETF Race Heats Up: Why July 14, July 21, And July 25 Are Important"" #Ethereum #Bitcoin #XRP #Solana #Ondo #Cronos #Binance #Picoin #Cardano #Litecoin #Finance #CryptoNews https://t.co/fdPxpHYKk3 — The Crypto Radar NewStand (@JONDONI_CRYPTO) July 12, 2025 ProShares had delayed these in April, but the SEC’s acknowledgement of the filings has brought back investor confidence. If approved, these funds will allow institutions to hedge or speculate on XRP more efficiently. ETF Launch Date: July 14 (ProShares Futures ETFs) Product Types: Long & Short Leverage Market Impact: Higher liquidity, more institutional activity The futures strategy could also be a stepping stone for spot ETFs, similar to Bitcoin’s regulatory path in the US. Leveraged Products on July 21 Momentum could accelerate on July 21 when Volatility Shares and Tuttle Capital launch 2X leveraged XRP ETFs. These products amplify daily returns—perfect for active traders looking to trade Ripple volatility. JUST IN: ProShares XRP ETF set to begin trading July 18, 2025. Documented. pic.twitter.com/7sUmG8i2oy — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 11, 2025 Both have completed regulatory steps, so there is a high probability of launch. If these ETFs go live, it will be the first time XRP has had multiple leveraged products in the US, which could increase volume and short-term price action. ETF Launch Date: July 21 Providers: Volatility Shares, Tuttle Capital Product: 2X Leveraged Long XRP ETFs Implication: More trading volume, volatility-driven opportunities These products will attract momentum traders and algorithmic funds that previously avoided XRP due to regulatory uncertainty. Spot XRP ETF Decision on July 25 The biggest news comes on July 25, when the SEC is expected to rule on the REX-Osprey Spot XRP ETF. Unlike futures ETFs, this will hold XRP directly, providing institutions with a regulated way to gain exposure without owning the asset itself. With court decisions going in Ripple’s favor and pressure mounting on the SEC to modernize its crypto approach, analysts think approval is getting more likely. If approved, this would not only be a green light but could open the door for other issuers like Bitwise and 21Shares to follow. Decision Date: July 25 ETF Type: Spot XRP ETF Issuer: REX Shares / Osprey Market Outlook: Institutional FOMO, new highs A spot ETF approval could be the catalyst, unlocking billions in capital and solidifying XRP’s top 10 status. XRP Chart Outlook: Overbought but Bullish From a technical standpoint, XRP price prediction continues to stay bullish as it is consolidating at $2.81 after a parabolic move above a rising channel. The price cleared the $2.695 resistance zone, which is now support. XPR/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, a Shooting Star on the 4-hour chart suggests possible exhaustion, particularly given the RSI’s position above 79, which is profound in overbought territory. Trade Setup: Buy Zone: $2.695–$2.62 (on dip) Stop Loss: $2.48 Targets: $2.97 short term, $3.14–$3.31 next resistance Watch for: Bullish engulfing or hammer candle Volume is tapering off, so patience is required. A dip would be a better entry. With ETFs dominating the July narrative, XRP could be entering a significant chapter. Now it’s all eyes on the regulators, and if approvals align, XRP may retest all-time highs.

2025-07-12T10:00:00,"Bitcoin’s all-time high fuels $1B in liquidations as ETH, XRP, MOG soar double digits","After being stuck in a month-long consolidation range between $100,000 and $110,000, Bitcoin broke out and set multiple all-time highs during the week. The total crypto market capitalisation climbed 10.88% over the week to $3.77 trillion, revisiting levels last seen in January. Market sentiment continued to strengthen, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising to 71. However, it remained below the June peak, indicating room for further upside. With risk sentiment replenished, altcoins closed the week in profit, as the rally extended across the broader market. Why is Bitcoin price increasing? Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $118,667 as of late Asian trading hours on Friday after rallying more than 10% over the past seven days. The breakout triggered one of the most severe short squeezes in recent years, wiping out over $1 billion in short positions within 24 hours, the largest daily liquidation event since 2021. According to CoinGlass, more than 232,000 traders were liquidated, with Bitcoin shorts accounting for over $570 million. The squeeze was amplified by high leverage and aggressive positioning around key resistance levels. Many high-leverage short positions were forced to close as Bitcoin surged through technical thresholds, further fuelling upward momentum. Rising institutional demand has also underpinned Bitcoin’s uptrend. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, launched earlier this year, continue to see steady inflows, with total net additions crossing $51 billion. On Thursday, the market recorded its second-largest daily inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs since launch, totalling $1.17 billion. Bitcoin’s breakout past $113,800 acted as a catalyst, driving inflows and sustaining bullish sentiment into Friday. Momentum has also been buoyed by growing optimism around the macroeconomic outlook. Traders are pricing in interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, with expectations that easing could begin as early as September. Fed officials like Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman have recently hinted at short-term rate cuts. Markets also anticipate accelerated cuts in 2026, should Donald Trump nominate a more dovish Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell. Historically, Bitcoin has benefited from looser monetary policy and low interest rates, which drive risk-on sentiment across asset classes. Meanwhile, crypto investors are closely watching political developments in Washington ahead of the “Crypto Week.” Lawmakers are scheduled to review three major bills in the coming week, including the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, the CLARITY Act to define regulatory roles between the SEC and CFTC, and a proposed ban on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). There’s also renewed speculation that China could ease its stance on digital assets. If that happens, such a move could unlock significant retail demand from Chinese investors. How high can Bitcoin go? With Bitcoin now in price discovery, market participants are eyeing higher targets ranging from $120,000 to as high as $250,000 over the coming months. The breakout above $113,800 has opened the door to a potential extension of the rally, especially as technical and macroeconomic conditions continue to align. In a July 10 media note, 10x Research head Markus Thielen estimated a 60% probability that Bitcoin could climb more than 20% in the next two months. This would put BTC above $140,000 by September if the uptrend holds. Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead echoed a similarly bullish outlook, projecting a $150,000 target based on ongoing ETF inflows, macro tailwinds, and expanding institutional adoption. Some analysts are even more optimistic. Pseudonymous trader Shibo, for instance, shared a fractal comparison of the 2020–2021 and 2024–2025 cycles, suggesting that Bitcoin’s current structure mirrors the early stages of its last major bull run. BTC/USD historical price trends. Source: Shibo. If the pattern plays out similarly, Shibo sees a $250,000 target as “programmed” over the next six months. A separate report by Keyrock outlined a potential path to $160,000 by year-end, provided corporate treasuries continue holding Bitcoin and macro conditions remain stable. However, the firm noted that it views $135,000 as a more probable year-end baseline but does not rule out a push toward the upper bound if risk sentiment persists. Others, however, are more cautious in the short term. CryptoOrca, who previously identified $120,000 as a key round-number resistance, now anticipates a short-term cooldown. (See below.) CryptOrca @CryptOrca · Follow $BTC $120k then retest for a support level wouldnt be bad 7:43 PM · Jul 11, 2025 11 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter According to the analyst, a pullback and retest of support around $113,000 would be healthy for the structure of the rally before any further upside. Looking at the Binance BTC/USDT 24-hour Liquidation Heatmap, the current market structure appears to support CryptoOrca’s view of a short-term cooldown. Binance BTC/USDT 24-hour Liquidation Heatmap. The heatmap reveals a concentration of liquidation clusters and leverage pockets between $111,000 and $113,000, indicating a strong zone of prior long interest and potential support. If Bitcoin experiences a pullback, this area is likely to act as a critical floor for the ongoing uptrend. The presence of dense yellow and green bands in this range suggests that many leveraged long positions were opened here. As a result, bulls will be incentivised to defend this level aggressively. A retest of this zone would not only reset overheated indicators but could also serve as a springboard for the next leg higher, potentially validating it as a new support base after the $100,000–$110,000 breakout. On the upside, the heatmap shows thinning liquidation density above the $118,000 mark, implying fewer short liquidations left to fuel a continued squeeze in the immediate term. This lack of short-side pressure could cap Bitcoin’s short-term upside around the psychological $120,000 level. Still, the long-term picture remains firmly bullish. As long as Bitcoin holds above the $111,000–$113,000 support band, momentum is expected to favour the further upside. Traders may look for high-conviction re-entry zones within this range before positioning for the next breakout phase. At press time, Bitcoin had some of its daily gains and was hovering around the $117,000 mark. Altcoin recap In the last 7 days, the altcoin market rose over 23% to reclaim the $1.52 trillion level, which it has not seen since early March. Analysts like Arthur Hayes think altcoin season could be on the horizon. Utility-focused cryptocurrencies such as Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), and Chainlink (LINK), all seen as strong ETF contenders, are expected to do well. But meme coins could end up gaining the most, just like they did in past bull runs. As of press time, Ethereum (ETH) was up 18% over the weekly period while XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and SUI (SUI) clocked gains ranging between 20-30%. MemeCore (M) was the highest gainer among the top 100 altcoins this week, soaring over 1,200% and pushing its market cap from $8 million to $1.36 billion at the time of writing. Mog Coin (MOG) and Story (IP), while not posting such explosive gains, also performed strongly with weekly increases of 82% and 45%, respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap MemeCore : MemeCore’s late-week rally was supported by a series of exchange listings, including Binance Alpha, Kraken, Bitget, BingX, HTX, and HashKey. Listings of this scale often trigger sharp moves for low-cap, newly launched tokens, a trend seen in previous bull cycles. MemeCore’s rally was further supported by a strategic partnership with market maker Klein Labs and a broader surge in market risk appetite following Bitcoin’s breakout to a new all-time high. Mog Coin : MOG’s price surged over the past week after it broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern, a chart setup in technical analysis that often signals a sharp move once the price escapes the narrowing range. The breakout drew in more investors who jumped in expecting further gains. The rally also benefited from the broader market recovery fuelled by Bitcoin’s new all-time highs, which reignited interest in the meme coin sector.

2025-07-12T09:57:49,"Upexi to to inject its Solana treasury with $200 million","Consumer products company Upexi has announced plans to bolster its Solana treasury. According to the update, the firm intends to raise $200 million to fund business operations as well as its further Solana purchases. The fund is expected to come from two separate financing vehicles, per the company’s statement. Upexi is a brand that specializes in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of consumer products, diversifying into the cryptocurrency industry. The company took to blogging platform X to announce how the funds would be raised. “Today we announced a blockbuster deal with a $150m in kind convertible note led by @BigBrainVC and a $50m equity private placement,” the firm said . Upexi also added that net proceeds will be used to purchase more Solana. Upexi set to raise $200 million to purchase SOL According to its statement, Upexi mentioned that the $150 million convertible note offering would be collateralized via locked, spot SOL provided by the purchasers of its convertible notes, which is expected to have a two-year maturity and a 2% interest rate that is payable every quarter. After the completion of the note offering, the tokens are expected to be added to the SOL treasury maintained by the company. The firm had previously announced its intention to build a digital assets treasury filled with Solana in April, raising $100 million to back its purchase at the time. The company said about 95% of the raised funds would be used to set up, fill, and operate its Solana-based treasury reserve, marking its diversification into the crypto space. Following the announcement, Upexi shares skyrocketed, finishing the day at $9.89, up by 335%. The share previously rose as high as 22%, marking its highest price in a year. With its latest purchase, Upexi will push its treasury balance to 1.65 million SOL worth around $270 million. With the firm holding such an amount of tokens, it now boasts twice the amount of Solana as another prominent, publicly traded Solana treasury, DeFi Development Corporation (DFDV). Shares of Upexi are yet to react as much as they did when the news of the first raise broke, with the stock only seeing a 7.8% rise to hit $5.39 after the announcement was made. The stock, UPXI, is down about 58% in the last month after its first jump, which saw it peak at $22.57, according to data from Google Finance. Nevertheless, the shares are still up by 53% year-to-date. Solana is also on the rise, with the asset trading at $162.47, a drop of 0.92% in the past day. SOL experienced a price rise on Friday, with Bitcoin also hitting a new all-time high at the same time. Meanwhile, Grayscale has called out the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for pausing the debut of its exchange-traded funds that hold several assets including Solana. The company alleged that its investors are suffering harm as a result of the SEC’s decision. The company asked the SEC to allow its Digital Large Cap Fund to begin trading.

2025-07-12T09:57:15,"Crypto Bull Run Gains Momentum, Here’s When Altcoin Season Might Start","The post Crypto Bull Run Gains Momentum, Here’s When Altcoin Season Might Start appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has officially broken past the $118,000 mark, hitting a new all-time high. Crypto analyst Virtual Bacon believes this is the beginning of a major bull cycle. However, he warns that altseason has not yet arrived. Here’s what’s happening, what to watch for, and why investors should stay patient. Bitcoin Bull Run Over the last seven days, Bitcoin has climbed 8.8%. So far this month, the price has jumped nearly 10%, touching a new all-time high of $118,000 . Virtual Bacon considers this breakout a major bullish signal and believes it marks the start of a new bull market. He points out that Bitcoin typically leads during early bull phases, with altcoins following once liquidity shifts. “Bitcoin’s breakout confirms the beginning of a new cycle,” he wrote on X . Bitcoin’s current support levels: 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA): $86,982 20-week SMA: $96,719 (a proven dip-buying zone) Altcoin Season Is Close, But Not Confirmed Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.58%, down from 65.50% on July 1. While this slight drop is a good sign, altseason typically begins after a sustained fall in BTC dominance. Virtual Bacon points out early indicators: E thereum’ s price against BTC has jumped 10.53% this month ETH/BTC now trades at 0.02516, up from 0.02276 A strong weekly close above 0.024 could signal a true breakout From July 5 to 10, ETH/BTC surged by 9.49%, although it saw a minor correction of 1.08% afterward. The strength in ETH and SOL is encouraging, but not yet a confirmation of full altcoin rotation. Fed Quietly Injecting Liquidity into Markets A major factor supporting the crypto rally is the Federal Reserve’s quiet liquidity injection. Virtual Bacon outlines two major moves: $11 billion repo injection on June 30 A proposal to reduce the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) for large banks. These actions boost bank reserves and allow for more lending, which increases liquidity in the broader financial system. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : BitcoinTalk User Turns $500 to $10M After Unlocking 2012 Bitcoin Bar , Additionally, the Global Liquidity Index is making a higher low. If it breaks above its April and September 2024 highs, it could confirm expanding liquidity—another condition needed for altseason. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 17. Reports suggest there is a 64% chance of a rate cut in Q4 2025, which could further fuel crypto momentum. Final Thoughts: Wait for Confirmation Before Diving Into Altcoins While Bitcoin’s breakout is undeniable and the early signs for altcoins are positive, Virtual Bacon advises caution. A confirmed altseason requires: Sustained BTC dominance drop Breakout in ETH/BTC Full expansion in global liquidity Investors are advised to avoid jumping into low-cap altcoins prematurely.
