BTC climbed above the $110,000 threshold while ETH pushed past $2,500, leading to heightened short-term volatility expectations as BTC's weekly implied volatility briefly surged. The derivatives landscape revealed interesting anomalies, including unexpectedly negative SOL perpetual funding rates despite recent ETF launch approvals and a persistent pattern where ETH options maintained roughly double the implied volatility levels of BTC equivalents throughout both the upward move and any retracements. Key Insights: BTC options volatility dipped to a 2-year low: BTC options markets experienced an unusual quiet period last week, with 7-day implied volatility dropping to just 26% on June 27 - the lowest level since mid-2023 at the $30,000 mark. This breakdown below the typical support levels was quickly reversed by the rally on July 2, which pushed volatility back up to 35% amid broader market optimism following the US-Vietnam trade agreement. ETH volatility indicated further upside: ETH significantly outperformed BTC during the July 1-2 period, climbing from $2,400 to over $2,500 before surging another 6% on trade deal news. This price action drove ETH's 7-day at-the-money implied volatility up by a 10-point daily increase. Throughout this period, ETH options consistently maintained roughly double the implied volatility of comparable BTC. ETH options skew shifted bullishly: The volatility term structure for the power duo of ETH and BTC remained relatively balanced through most of the week due to limited price movement.

2025-07-04T13:56:08,"Is Elon Musk Really Behind the Bitcoin Buzz This Time?","The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to volatility induced by Elon Musk . His tweets have historically caused major price swings. But as BTC flirts with fresh highs, the current rally is more data-driven—and the Tesla CEO’s role remains unconfirmed. Bitcoin Hits Record Quarterly Close Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has achieved a historic milestone by closing the second quarter at its highest level ever, reaching $107,149 on the Bitstamp exchange. This performance follows an 11.6% decline in the first quarter, but Bitcoin rebounded with a 30% gain in the second quarter. Social metrics from LunarCrush and Santiment show a spike in Bitcoin-related engagement following a cryptic tweet from Musk on June 29. The post included a rocket emoji and a dollar symbol—enough to prompt a flurry of interpretations from the crypto community. However, no direct reference to Bitcoin was made. Analysts at CryptoQuant and Kaiko note that while social sentiment surged after the tweet, no significant wallet activity linked to Musk or Tesla has been reported. Bloomberg estimates that BlackRock IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. Glassnode reports that Bitcoin’s 14-day RSI remains under 60, suggesting there’s room for more momentum. Price is holding above its 50-day ($105,970) and 200-day ($87,717) moving averages. Meanwhile, whale activity appears mixed. IntoTheBlock data shows a 45% drop in large BTC transactions over the past month, suggesting some cooling among high-net-worth traders. Still, BTC’s technical posture remains bullish. The network’s health and rising ETF demand suggest fundamental strength rather than hype-driven movement. While Elon Musk’s influence on the market remains a wildcard, current data suggests that his actions do not primarily drive Bitcoin’s momentum.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/is-elon-musk-really-behind-the-bitcoin-buzz-this-time/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk",cryptocompare

Here Are All the Details Users Need to Know…","As regulations regarding cryptocurrency transactions continue in Türkiye, exchanges are announcing new criteria that investors must follow in order to comply with these regulations. At this point, the final statement came from Binance TR, the Turkish arm of Binance. According to the official statement from Binance TR, Binance TR announced the new regulations that came as part of the new obligations introduced by the Financial Crimes Investigation Board General Communiqué (Sequence No: 29) and MASAK, published in the Official Gazette on June 28, 2025. Accordingly, Binance TR announced that a waiting period has been introduced for all new crypto asset investments or purchase/sale transactions as of 15:00 on July 4, 2025, in order to increase user security and ensure full compliance with legal obligations. Balances resulting from cryptocurrency transactions made after the specified date will be subject to a 72-hour waiting period. After the first cryptocurrency withdrawal transaction made by users who have completed the 72-hour waiting period, the waiting period for other assets in their account and subsequent crypto investments will be 48 hours. “As of 15:00 on July 4, 2025, a 72-hour waiting period will be applied for the withdrawal of cryptocurrency balances currently in the user's account. After this date and time, all new crypto asset investments made to the user account or crypto currency balances resulting from purchase/exchange transactions will also be subject to a 72-hour waiting period. After the first cryptocurrency withdrawal or transfer transaction made by the user after the 72-hour waiting period, the waiting period will be updated to 48 hours for withdrawals made for other cryptocurrencies in the user's account or for each new cryptocurrency added to the user's account. Binance TR stated that Turkish Lira (TRY) deposits and withdrawals will not be subject to a waiting period and will continue at their current speed. Binance TR recently added that since transactions made via Binance TR to crypto asset wallets matching the user's Turkish ID number are already compliant with the Travel Rule, crypto asset withdrawal transactions made through this channel will be exempt from the waiting period. 28 Haziran 2025 tarihli Resmî Gazete’de yayımlanan MASAK Genel Tebliği uyarınca, 4 Temmuz 2025 saat 15.00 itibarıyla kripto varlık çekim işlemlerinde bekleme süresi uygulaması başlatılmaktadır.

Bitcoin Wallets Move BTC Worth $2 Billion After 14-Year Dormancy","Two dormant Bitcoin whale addresses dating back to the era when Satoshi Nakamoto was still active have been woken up after 14 years. The Bitcoin wallets collectively transferred 20,000 BTC, worth roughly $2 billion, on Friday, creating buzz on social media, with speculation that it was Satoshi’s wallet. The recent movement of Bitcoin whale addresses containing Bitcoin from the 2011 era comes just days after the price of the asset briefly rebounded above $110,000 for the first time since June 11. Satoshi-Era BTC Awakens On April 3, 2011, a Bitcoin wallet starting with “1HqXB” moved 23,377.83 BTC to three different addresses. Two of these wallets each received 10,000 BTC, while the third received the remaining 3,377.83 BTC, according to data tracked by Blockchain.com. The two wallets that received 10,000 BTC each, “1GcCK” and “bc1qm”, have remained dormant for 14 years until early Friday, when they transferred their respective BTC stashes to new addresses within 30 minutes of each other. The third wallet, which received 3,377.83 BTC, had already spent its funds back in 2011. The term “Satoshi era” refers to the early days after Bitcoin was created, when its enigmatic inventor, Nakamoto, was active online in forums. Some Satoshi-era wallets are often speculated to be linked to Satoshi himself. Others on X suggested it could be Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht moving his coins now that he is free after being pardoned by President Donald Trump earlier this year. At the time of the transfers in 2011, the premier crypto was priced at around 78 cents. The two wallets with 10K BTC slept through the Bitcoin bull run and the all-time high of over $111,800 in May 2025. This means that the 20,000 BTC has appreciated by nearly 14,000,000% in value within the 14 years of inactivity, soaring from a mere $7,800 to a staggering $2.18 billion. Whether the wallets belong to the same individual or entity is not confirmed, though the wallet history and transaction patterns suggest that it could be the case. Moreover, the exact reason for the transfer is also unknown at publication time. Nonetheless, the latest transfers were made to non-exchange addresses, which have not moved the coins since — signaling no immediate intention to take profits after over a decade of patiently HODLing.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/satoshi-is-that-you-bitcoin-wallets-move-btc-worth-2-billion-after-14-year-dormancy/,"BTC|TRADING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|satoshi",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T13:50:19,"U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Astounding $603M Inflows, Igniting Market Optimism","BitcoinWorld U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Astounding $603M Inflows, Igniting Market Optimism The world of digital finance is buzzing with exhilarating news as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recently experienced a monumental surge in investments. On July 3, these groundbreaking financial instruments collectively registered a staggering $603 million in total net inflows, a clear indicator of robust and growing interest in the leading cryptocurrency. This significant influx of capital into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is not just a number; it’s a powerful testament to the increasing confidence and institutional adoption shaping the future of the crypto market . A Closer Look: Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows The recent daily data from July 3, as reported by Trader T on X, paints a vivid picture of strong investor appetite. The combined net inflow of $603 million into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a remarkable day for the nascent asset class. Let’s break down which players led the charge: Fidelity’s FBTC: Leading the pack with an impressive $237.13 million in net inflows. Fidelity continues to demonstrate its significant influence in attracting investor capital. BlackRock’s IBIT: Close behind, securing $225.59 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s consistent performance underscores its dominant position in the ETF landscape. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Contributed substantially with $114.25 million in net inflows, showcasing continued interest in ARK’s innovative approach. Bitwise’s BITB: Added a solid $15.53 million, reinforcing its steady presence. Grayscale’s mini BTC: Saw $5.84 million in net inflows, indicating a positive shift even for its smaller fund. VanEck’s HODL: Registered $4.66 million, rounding out the positive contributors for the day. It’s worth noting that the remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, which further highlights the concentrated positive momentum seen across these key funds. These substantial Bitcoin ETF inflows are more than just daily figures; they reflect a growing comfort level among both retail and institutional investors with accessing Bitcoin through regulated financial products. Why Do These Bitcoin ETF Inflows Matter So Much for the Crypto Market? The consistent flow of capital into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs carries profound implications for the entire crypto market . Here’s why these inflows are critical: Price Support and Appreciation: Each dollar flowing into these ETFs typically means more Bitcoin is being purchased by the fund managers to back the ETF shares. This creates constant buying pressure, which can support Bitcoin’s price and potentially drive it higher over time. Enhanced Legitimacy: The approval and subsequent success of these ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have lent significant legitimacy to Bitcoin as an investable asset class. It signals to traditional finance that Bitcoin is maturing and can be integrated into mainstream portfolios. Increased Liquidity: As more capital flows in, the overall liquidity of the Bitcoin market improves. This can lead to more stable price discovery and reduce volatility, making it a more attractive asset for larger investors. Broader Accessibility: ETFs provide a straightforward, regulated, and familiar pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership, such as setting up wallets or managing private keys. This expands the investor base significantly. These factors collectively contribute to a more robust and mature ecosystem for digital assets , with Bitcoin leading the charge. The daily inflow numbers serve as a barometer for investor sentiment and the pace of mainstream adoption. Understanding the Driving Force Behind Institutional Adoption The significant inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are a clear indicator of accelerating institutional adoption . But what exactly is driving this trend? Regulatory Clarity: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs provided a long-awaited regulatory framework, alleviating many concerns that previously deterred large institutions. Knowing they can invest through regulated products reduces compliance risks. Diversification Benefits: Institutions are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a portfolio diversifier. Its low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, particularly during periods of market stress, makes it an attractive addition for risk management. Inflation Hedge Narrative: In an era of persistent inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature are often viewed as a potential hedge against currency debasement, appealing to long-term institutional capital. Growing Market Maturity: The infrastructure supporting the crypto market has evolved significantly, with robust custodians, improved security measures, and more sophisticated trading platforms. This maturity makes institutions more comfortable entering the space. Major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity, with their vast client networks and established reputations, are pivotal in normalizing Bitcoin investments. Their active participation in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs market sends a strong signal to other institutional players, creating a positive feedback loop for further capital inflows. Navigating the Evolving Digital Assets Landscape The success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is not an isolated event; it’s a significant development within the broader, rapidly evolving digital assets landscape. Bitcoin, as the pioneer cryptocurrency, often sets the tone for the wider market. These inflows suggest a maturing perception of cryptocurrencies beyond speculative tools to legitimate investment vehicles. The increasing integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial products like ETFs paves the way for other digital assets . While Bitcoin enjoys the first-mover advantage and the largest market capitalization, the blueprint for regulated investment products could eventually extend to other major cryptocurrencies, contingent on regulatory clarity and market demand. For investors, understanding this evolving landscape means recognizing that: 1. Access is Easier: Getting exposure to crypto is no longer solely for the tech-savvy; it’s becoming as simple as buying a stock. 2. Market Depth is Growing: Larger capital pools mean more robust markets, potentially reducing extreme volatility over the long term. 3. Regulatory Frameworks are Forming: While still nascent, the existence of regulated ETFs indicates a path towards clearer guidelines, which is crucial for mainstream adoption. This dynamic environment presents both opportunities and challenges, requiring investors to stay informed about regulatory shifts, technological advancements, and market sentiment. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin and Investment? The consistent and substantial Bitcoin ETF inflows , like the $603 million witnessed on July 3, paint an optimistic picture for the future of Bitcoin. This sustained buying pressure from regulated investment vehicles could contribute to a more stable and upward trajectory for Bitcoin’s price in the long run. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is not just a fleeting trend but a foundational component of future financial portfolios. Looking ahead, we can anticipate several potential developments: Increased Institutional Allocation: More pension funds, endowments, and corporate treasuries may begin to allocate a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin via ETFs. Development of More Crypto-ETFs: While challenging, the success of Bitcoin ETFs could eventually spur demand and regulatory willingness for ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies, though this is a much more complex regulatory hurdle. Enhanced Financial Products: The success could lead to the creation of more sophisticated financial products built around Bitcoin, further deepening its integration into global finance. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market remains subject to its unique volatilities, regulatory uncertainties, and macroeconomic factors. While inflows are positive, they don’t negate the potential for price fluctuations. Investors should always conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance. Key Takeaways for Savvy Investors The recent surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows offers valuable insights for anyone interested in the digital assets space: Institutional Interest is Real: The numbers don’t lie. Large financial players are actively putting capital into Bitcoin. ETFs are Game-Changers: They have democratized access to Bitcoin for a wider range of investors, bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto. Stay Informed: Daily inflow data, while a snapshot, provides crucial insights into market sentiment and capital flows. Keep an eye on these trends. Long-Term Perspective: While daily fluctuations occur, the consistent positive inflows suggest a strong underlying demand for Bitcoin as a long-term asset. These inflows represent a significant vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s future. They highlight a pivotal moment where digital currencies are increasingly becoming integrated into the fabric of global finance, moving from the fringes to the mainstream. Conclusion: A Bright Horizon for Bitcoin The impressive $603 million in total net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 3 is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and enduring appeal. Led by giants like Fidelity and BlackRock, these significant Bitcoin ETF inflows underscore the accelerating pace of institutional adoption and the maturation of the broader crypto market . As more traditional capital finds its way into digital assets through regulated channels, Bitcoin solidifies its position as a legitimate and increasingly integral part of the global financial landscape. This trend not only signals strong confidence but also paves the way for an exciting and transformative future for digital finance.

2025-07-04T13:46:15,"NASDAQ-Listed DeFi Development Drops $2.72M on Solana, Now Sits on Nearly $100M SOL Treasury","DeFi Development Corp (DFDV) purchased 17,760 Solana (SOL) tokens for its cryptocurrency treasury, valued at approximately $2.72 million. DeFi Development has focused its attention on Solana due to its DeFi capabilities and ability to compete with similar tokens, such as Ethereum . DeFi Development now holds 640,585 SOL tokens, valued at approximately $98.1 million. The investment in SOL marks a stark contrast to other companies that mainly invest in Bitcoin. DeFi Development also has an interest in engaging with the Solana ecosystem to enhance its business operations. The latest purchase of 17,760 SOL had an average price of $153.10 per token. DeFi Development will store the tokens as validators for Solana, allowing the company to earn yields. They have even developed their validators to do the compounding independently. Wu Blockchain, a crypto journalist, announced the news online, declaring that DeFi Development was continuing its Solana treasury strategy by purchasing 17,760 SOL tokens. Wu Blockchain also mentioned that DeFi Dev was being consistent with their focus on Solana . DeFi Dev aims to compound their treasury over time by reinvesting SOL tokens as validators for the Solana ecosystem. DeFi Dev is a Nasdaq-listed company that goes under the ticker DFDV. DeFi Dev was proud to announce the new milestone. They have an impressive SOL treasury of nearly $100 million, which may help them continue business operations even during difficult times. A Solana-centric approach dominates the business model of DeFi Dev, with a treasury strategy combined with a staking approach to making profits. DeFi Dev has started its staking process for both internal and external clients. Staking is analogous to Bitcoin mining, as it is a method for generating revenue. The company has chosen Solana as its primary cryptocurrency due to its fast transaction speeds and DeFi capabilities. This is in contrast to Bitcoin’s problematic track record of scalability and limited abilities to program its blockchain. DeFi Dev, however, isn’t the only company investing in Solana. Sol Strategies, a Canadian firm, created a $1 billion prospectus to fund its Solana treasury and expand its validator activities. Solana has become a viable alternative to Ethereum, offering staking capabilities that make it an environmentally friendly option. Solana could also be used to expand services that tokenize real-world assets. The sol-per-share ratio for DeFi Development is currently at 0.042, which translates to $6.65 per share. The metric could help compare various treasury companies to ascertain the relative strength of their treasuries. DeFi Dev has 14,740,779 shares outstanding according to their June 2024 filing. The Solana treasury has been carefully designed to be stored for an extended period, compounding interest through its yields. DeFi Dev has developed a business model based on the principles of compounding, while also offering validation services for the Solana network. DeFi Dev will keep shareholders and stakeholders informed of their treasury performance through regular filings and reports. DeFi Development Corp has become a Solana-centric company, employing various acquisition strategies to purchase more of its common stock and acquire Solana for validation purposes. Such an asset-centric strategy has yet to prove its worth over time. The company has also suggested that shareholders could further use derivatives to hedge their exposure to Solana and optimise their portfolio. DeFi Dev has experienced various setbacks, including a failed SEC filing for $1 billion in funds on June 11, due to a misfiled 10-K form. However, the company has addressed these problems and has continued its treasury strategy. Solana traders may welcome the news of a Solana-based strategy, as it could be added to their portfolio, or they could subscribe to the company’s annual reports.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/nasdaq-listed-defi-development-drops-2-72m-on-solana-now-sits-on-nearly-100m-sol-treasury/,"SOL|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T13:44:04,"S&P 500 rally brings it closer to sell signal: BoFA","While global stocks are likely to continue higher despite fresh tariff concerns, Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett has warned that moves above 6,300 for the S&P 500 could trigger a “sell signal.” Bank of America strategists said in a research report that investors have allocated significant funds into cash and bonds in recent days, even as stocks rallied to record highs. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite edged higher as markets welcomed the easing of Middle East tensions and positive sentiment driven by macroeconomic tailwinds. Fresh trade war risks The S&P 500 has had a stunning past few weeks, with a notable stocks bounce in May seeing the benchmark index hit new record highs as it closed at 6,279.35 on Thursday. Major U.S. indices advanced on better-than-expected payrolls data before markets closed for the July 4 Independence Day holiday. Although upward momentum may persist into next week, analysts caution that a continued rally could place the S&P 500 on the edge of a sell signal. This outlook coincides with renewed concerns over trade policy, as President Donald Trump’s recent tariff remarks have brought trade war risks back into focus. With the 90-day tariff pause nearing its end , some investors are adopting a more cautious stance. Hartnett suggests that if the current optimism holds and the S&P 500 surpasses the 6,300 mark in the coming weeks, a period of selling could be imminent. As well as the extended rally, BoFA strategists say bubble risks are growing, particularly after Congress approved Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ – a policy and tax bill featuring a $3.4 trillion package.

In their assessment, the likelihood of the S&P 500 rallying to 7,000 this summer outweighs the probability of a sharp decline to 5,000. “Overbought markets can stay overbought as greed is harder to conquer than fear,” Hartnett wrote. The bank also reported that investors funneled more than $56 billion into money market funds last week, while bonds attracted over $20 billion in weekly inflows through July 2. Equities recorded net inflows of $2.2 billion, with gold attracting $1.4 billion and cryptocurrency funds drawing more than $1 billion. The surge into digital asset investment funds came as Bitcoin ( BTC ) briefly spiked above $110,000 before pulling back below the key psychological level.

2025-07-04T13:42:45,"Dogecoin Price Prediction – Analyst Flags Major Technical Breakout: Could DOGE Be Gearing Up for a 3x Run?","The new month has ushered in a fresh wave of retail liquidity in what analysts have dubbed a potential reversal setup, creating early bullishness for the near-term Dogecoin price prediction . After months of suppressed price action, volume levels unseen since June could mark new upward volatility for the meme coin , topping 1.71 billion over the past 24 hours. Still, risk-on sentiment remains fragile to broader macro narratives. Weaker-than-expected June U.S. jobs data and the looming July 9 “Liberation Day” tariff pause expiry fuel fresh FUD.

Popular pseudonymous crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade noted the early onset of a bullish reversal structure in a June 1 X post , citing a breakout above a critical 50-day descending trendline. Tardigrade notes that Dogecoin price has now formed a higher low, higher high, higher low sequence in its move above the long-standing trendline—the beginnings of a classic reversal structure.

If this structure of successive higher highs and higher lows continues, it could signal that a new uptrend is forming, with buyers gradually regaining control of the market. This comes as speculative interest is building with traders actively following Dogecoin price moves. CoinGlass data shows a 24.7% rise in Open Interest since the month began. Dogecoin Open Interest (USD) starts July on uptrend. Source: Coinglass, DOGE Derivatives. These Derivative traders appear to be positioning for a continuation, with a long/short ratio of 2.92 on Binance showing that over 74.5% of its users are betting on price increases. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Is This the Start of a 3x Move? The development highlighted by Trader Tardigrade on the daily chart feeds into the broader breakout setup of a massive 4-year cup-and-handle pattern. This emerging uptrend aligns with historical support stretching back to Mid-2024, creating a potential confluence zone for a breakout as it meets the upper resistance of the handle. If the reversal sequence holds, the historical support could be a breakout launchpad for the pattern’s $0.75 technical target—a 3.45x gain from current levels. Momentum indicators support this outlook. The RSI continues trending higher, holding above 40, signaling that sellers are gradually losing control. More so, the MACD line is approaching a bullish cross above the signal line for the first time since early June. On the 3-day timeframe, this often signals the early stages of a new mid-term uptrend. However, for this 3.45x move to fully materialize by the end of the year, a market-warming social or fundamental catalyst like the October 17 U.S. spot DOGE ETF decision deadline will likely play a key part.

We expect a wave of new ETFs in this second half of 2025. pic.twitter.com/H3pxJhqMy3 — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 30, 2025 Immediate resistance at $0.186 remains the key threshold for a decisive breakout. A rejection here risks confirming a false breakout, putting pressure on the historical support. If this level is lost, the next major support level lies 45% lower at the mid-2024 market bottom around $0.09. Bitcoin Could be the Bigger Play – With Some Help Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With almost $2 million in its third presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 410% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

Bullish traders are stepping in to defend this level, to protect its price from a drop that could lead to a revisit of its all-time low. As technical signals, the token’s price has been consolidating, leaving many to wonder about its next move. While its recent data from PiScan reveals a concerning future over the next 30 days, as more than 300 million tokens are waiting to be unlocked. The past is evident that it is not good news, at least for Pi Network, because demand has failed to keep pace with the influx of new tokens. Is Artificial Optimism In The Market For PI Network? Despite these bearish indicators, a wave of possible artificial optimism is emerging, fueled by the X account Pi News, which is claiming that PI could soon print the largest green candle in crypto history. $Pi is going to print the largest green candle in the crypto history, believe this . pic.twitter.com/q8lLBVOhnd — Pi News (@PiListingNews) July 2, 2025 Followed by a recent post from the account that hinted that PI coin is set to surprise investors in the coming weeks. The source of this optimism remains unclear, but the core team behind PI Network has been actively promoting their efforts to develop applications through Pi App Studio. This seems like a calculative strategy aiming to transform the coin’s image from a stagnant asset to a promising utility coin for the future. But will it work? Still a mystery. Source: Sentiment However, this post seems like an artificial post, just an effort to pump PI, which is more clear than ever with its on-chain metrics, that describes the overall flow of people’s thoughts are bearish and pessimistic. Even negative sentiment for PI just spiked, while positive sentiment on the chart can be seen clearly that it is on the decline. [post_titles_links postid=”478476″] Can This Be An End For PI Network’s Price? The PI Network price has reached a level on the chart that is marked as either a MAKE-OR-BREAK moment, as periods of low volatility have often preceded a significant outburst if an asset is truly credible. Is the PI Network credible for gains? Many might be wondering this at this point. However, with token unlocks lined up for the next 30 days and weak utility factors contributing to lower adoption, positive views are overshadowed by bearish sentiment. This clearly indicates that PI could be approaching its final shattering point. If it loses support near $0.477, it could slide to an all-time low of $0.40, raising the odds for the PI Network to descend further into the abyss. Conversely, if the token unlocks meet the right demand and drive utility-driven adoption, only then does it have a chance of survival in the industry.

Binance Institutional Loans – With 0% Interest In a recent tweet post, Binance CEO Richard Teng announced that the company is launching “Binance Institutional Loans,” a product that allows large clients to borrow against their entire portfolio using multiple accounts.

They can use over 400 crypto assets, including BTC, ETH, BNB, and SOL, to back the loan. These loans offer more flexibility than regular ones and don’t cut extra value from popular coins. If clients meet certain trading goals, they could even pay 0% interest, which means big savings for high-volume traders.

2025-07-04T13:30:27,"Ethereum to Mimic Bitcoin and Go On a Massive Bull Move, $4,000 Target in Sight","Ethereum (ETH) is looking upbeat once again as it tries to wrestle some measure of control from the bears. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently mimicking the early explosive growth of Bitcoin itself, raising possibilities of a major price breakout, according to one popular crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter). Crypto GEMs, the X commentator in question, tweeted the similarity between BTC’s major price appreciation in early 2024 and Ethereum’s price action in recent months. According to another tweet by the same account, Ethereum is primed for an explosive rally, one that will take it above $4.2k in the coming months as the bull market intensifies. Ethereum has had a disappointing 2024-2025 bull market overall when it comes to comparing it to the previous two cycles of 2016-2017 and 2020-2021. The premier programmable language has struggled to adapt to change and has encountered several dead ends in its development over the last couple of years. However, there is still a chance that ETH can provide the goods in the near future, as it is starting to show some promise. Ethereum’s Recent Price Action Here is the ETH/USD price action for the last three months: Image Source: TradingView According to this graph, ETH has been quietly trending upward over the last couple of months, following lows in early May. The crypto attempted to move to $3,000 early in June but failed to break through and is now trading around the $ 2,600 valuation. The coin currently has a massive $312 billion valuation, and a major move is expected to raise the stakes of crypto to new heights, potentially overtaking some of the major companies in terms of valuation. Will ETH Finally Take Off Now? ETH’s 2024-2025 bull market journey has been one to forget overall. The crypto has yet to post a new All-Time High (ATH) during this cycle and remains stuck with one setback in November 2021, worth just below $5,000. A coin that cannot even surpass previous bull market highs in a new bull season is technically in decline, and ETH seems to be a textbook example of this case. BTC’s 2021 high was $69, and it is already sitting confidently around $110k, so there is a clear contrast in performance. However, there is still time for ETH to turn things around, and analysts are predicting a last hurrah for the digital currency in the coming months. It needs to make a clear move, first above $3k and then onwards towards $5k, or it could be bad news for it. The digital asset has been one of the cornerstones of the crypto market for the better part of 8 years, but if it fails to perform in the ensuing months, there is a real possibility that it will start to fade away. Other programmable networks, such as Solana , Sui, Tron , and Chainlink , could be gearing up to take their place.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-to-mimic-bitcoin-and-go-on-a-massive-bull-move-4000-target-in-sight/,"ETH|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|LINK","Bitcoin|Ethereum|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T13:30:00,"VanEck Crypto Monthly Recap For June 2025","Summary Bitcoin climbed 3% on strong ETP inflows while altcoins slumped, deepening a divergence that underscores both growing institutional BTC demand and fragility across the broader crypto landscape. Since January 2024, only 36% of the top 300 tokens are up. 25% more tokens have dropped over 50% than gained that much, and in 2025 alone, 7.5x more tokens declined over 50% than appreciated similarly. On June 25th, Bitcoin miner Bit Digital announced its transition into a pure-play Ethereum staking and treasury company, initiating the wind-down of its Bitcoin mining operations and beginning a gradual conversion of its BTC holdings into ETH. Bitcoin climbed 3% on strong ETP inflows while altcoins slumped, deepening a divergence that underscores both growing institutional BTC demand and fragility across the broader crypto landscape. June was a quiet month for crypto, with most tokens drifting lower amid declining volatility. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was the standout, rising +3% for the month on steady ETP inflows totaling $4.5B .

Just 12% are up YTD, underscoring the increasingly skewed, Pareto-like nature of the crypto market. June Leaders: Arbitrum’s ARB ( ARB-USD ): +6% Tron’s TRX ( TRX-USD ): +4% June’s Laggards: Cardano’s ADA ( ADA-USD ): -18% Sui’s SUI ( SUI-USD ): -15% ARB rebounded from an early-June drawdown to end the month up 6% . This move followed Robinhood’s announcement to list up to 200 tokenized equities on Arbitrum for EU investors starting June 30. Long term, Robinhood aims to migrate this to its own blockchain, developed by Arbitrum creator Offchain Labs. While the news is positive, it’s unlikely to drive material fee growth or value accrual to the ARB token. The commercial arrangement compensates Offchain Labs, not ARB holders. Exchange Volumes and BTC Volatility Trading volumes dropped 29% across centralized exchanges (CEXeS) and were flat YoY. Spot volumes in BTC and ETH fell to multi-year lows relative to futures (BTC ( BTC-USD ): 19% , ETH ( ETH-USD ): 13% ).

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. BTC volatility dropped to 33% , the lowest since summer 2024. This was partly seasonal but also reflects structural demand: ETPs bought 42K BTC in June and BTC treasury firms added another 68K , more than offsetting June’s 13.5K BTC mined. This steady absorption suppresses volatility by providing a consistent bid. Crypto Treasury Companies An additional volatility dampener comes from the emergence of BTC treasury companies. Twenty-one new entities adopted the MicroStrategy-style strategy in June. These firms use debt issuance and equity to accumulate BTC, often trading at premiums to their holdings based on bullish BTC assumptions and easy capital access. These firms often trade at premiums to their BTC holdings, but the model carries major downside risk. A BTC drawdown >25% could crash their mNAVs, as seen with MSTR in 2022. In extreme cases, forced BTC sales could trigger recursive declines. While innovative, these firms are high-risk, option-like plays on BTC. In May we wrote about how MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), the pioneer of BTC Treasury Strategies, employs financialization to gradually increase BTC exposure for common shareholders. Currently, these entities are benefitting from a positive market environment buoyed by BTC price appreciation. With BTC going up in value, these companies can more easily finance additional BTC exposure by issuing securities receptive capital markets. If we assume that the market is rationally valuing these companies based upon terminal BTC holdings and a terminal BTC price in the future, this valuation will increase during market upswings. This is because BTC price projections will become more bullish and each company’s ability to finance new BTC purchases will also increase. The result is a higher terminal valuation for each BTC treasury company. As such, many of these companies are trading a premium to their holdings of BTC based upon a rosy outlook for Bitcoin and the financing market for Bitcoin treasury companies. However, things can turn grim very quickly for these Bitcoin companies if BTC experiences one of its typical, large drawdowns of (> -25% ). MSTR demonstrated this negative dynamic during the summer of 2022 when its mNAV fell as low as 0.7 . If BTC price collapses, the downside will translate into mNAV degradation for many of these BTC companies. And, if these businesses are unable to fund operations or make debt repayments, market participants may begin to sense these BTC companies may be forced to liquidate their BTC holdings. This may cause recursive price depreciation for both the treasury companies and BTC. As a result, while we see some of these vehicles as interesting financial experiments to give holders option-like exposure to BTC, we recognize the massive risks posed to investors in these companies. Solana Updates Solana Has the 2nd Highest ""Blockchain GDP"" Source: Token Terminal as of 6/30/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. With an ETH ETP approved last July, anticipation was high for a SOL ETP in 2025. That milestone materialized on July 2 with the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK), which traded an impressive ~$40M on its first day. However, SSK is not a spot-based ETP in the traditional sense. Instead, it functions as a fund-of-funds, holding a Cayman subsidiary that invests in SOL and participates in staking via providers like Jito. The structure sidesteps direct SEC approval of spot SOL custody by leveraging the 1940 Act and a C-corp wrapper. While a major step forward, SSK comes at a cost, charging a 1.4% expense ratio, and leaves room for future products with purer exposure. As the first spot SOL ETP filer, we remain optimistic that a more direct, staking-enabled structure could be approved, offering lower fees, improved redemption mechanics, and greater transparency at launch. We believe Solana is well-positioned to underpin the emerging 'Internet Capital Markets', a digital environment for real-time financial exchange. Its strengths include: Latency: Solana confirms transactions in 400ms with 5s finality which is vastly quicker than BTC (1 hour) or ETH (13 min), critical for real-time commerce. Throughput: Solana averages 1.5K TPS with bursts >10K TPS, enabling cheap, sub-cent microtransactions for mass-scale applications. Ongoing Innovation: With teams like Anza and Firedancer, Solana aims for 100K TPS within a year, 1M TPS in three and this aggressive roadmap is unique among blockchains. Developer Base: Solana hosts ~6,400 active developers ( ~25% of all crypto devs), driven by its rich tooling and performance. Solana's application layer continues to grow across verticals, including trading, liquid staking, consumer tokens, and anti-bot infrastructure.

This application derives value from all DEX activity by means of earning MEV revenues. Raydium: The top Automated Market Maker on Solana whose liquidity pools plug into a central on-chain order book for combined AMM and limit-order depth. Adds revenues through trading activity. pump.fun: No-code Solana launchpad for new tokens that provides novel assets that drive new trading volumes. The tokens launched on Pump were responsible for as much as 90% of Solana trading volumes in January 2025. Meteora: A novel AMM whose pools adjust fees and token balances algorithmically to reflect market conditions. Meteora’s volumes are up 272% YoY. Orca : Solana AMM supporting concentrated-liquidity “Whirlpool” pools for capital-efficient swaps. Orca was once a more dominant DEX but has lost market share to competitors who focused on memecoins falling from 31% market share in 1Q2024 to 15% market share by 1Q2025. Axiom Trade: Axiom is a recent creation to prevent Solana users from being front run by trading bots. Trading volume has grown 40x since Jan 2025 to June 2025, $8M -> $3.2B . Trojan: A trading application that simplifies trading by using Telegram as a wallet and to execute trades. This provides a more “social trading” experience. The app has grown from 160K monthly active users in Jan 2025 to 350K monthly active users in June 2025. Photon : A competing telegram trading application to Trojan that earned $6.9M in revenue over the past month. BullX: A platform that combines complex trading features to enable more sophisticated trading strategies. The application averages 260K monthly active users in June 2025 and generated $2.6M in revenues. SOL ETP and Staking Considerations A key feature for a successful SOL ETP will be staking integration. Without it, investors could lose out on 7–10% annual yield and suffer dilution, as roughly half of SOL’s yield derives from inflationary issuance. However, including staking introduces multiple challenges: Operational risks: These include validator slashing, key management failures, or governance misalignment. Tax uncertainty: There is limited IRS guidance on staking income treatment. Principal-agent issues: Validators may profit from opaque activities (e.g. MEV) not passed through to ETP holders. Redemption constraints: While ETP shares must redeem T+1, unstaking SOL can take ~2 days (and longer for ETH). Market makers must hedge this gap at a cost (~9bps/day at a 40% cost of capital). Some solutions for redemptions have been presented, but none of these are ideal. One idea is to let market makers charge investors for early access to unstaked tokens, but that model assumes liquid and cheaply priced withdrawal markets. During bouts of volatility, the cost of capital soars and the exit fee does too. Another idea is to hold a liquid staking token (LST), yet regulators in several jurisdictions treat these tokens as unregistered securities. Additionally, they are prone to de-pegging under stress. In the summer of 2022, Lido’s stETH traded at ( 88% ) percent of its net asset value. LSTs also introduce additional smart-contract risks that are hard for typical ETF investors to evaluate. We are working with validators to model these tradeoffs and remain optimistic about a path forward. With transparency, coordination, and thoughtful structuring, a staking-enabled SOL ETP is achievable.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Investors poured ~$1.1B into Ethereum ETPs in June, the second-largest month since their launch in 2024. Actual institutional demand for ETH may be even higher, as this figure coincides with a renewed interest in using ETH as a treasury asset. We first noted this trend in May, when several public companies began emulating the treasury strategy popularized by Strategy (MSTR), but using ETH instead. While both ETH ETPs and ETH treasury strategies are bullish for the asset, they compete for similar pools of capital. Source: Yahoo Finance, Company Press Releases as of 6/30/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. On June 25th, Bitcoin miner Bit Digital ( BTBT ) announced its transition into a pure-play Ethereum staking and treasury company, initiating the wind-down of its Bitcoin mining operations and beginning a gradual conversion of its BTC holdings into ETH. However, the stock opened down (- 17% ) the following morning, raising questions about market appetite for ETH treasury-focused firms. In contrast, on June 30th, newly uplisted BitMine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) announced a $250M private placement, selling 55,555,556 shares of common stock for $4.50 per share, with plans to use the proceeds to acquire ETH for its treasury operations. We suspect this divergent performance reflects BMNR’s smaller size, prominent backers, and relatively large fundraise, which could make it a more compelling and straightforward pure-play ETH treasury play in the eyes of investors. Ethereum’s blockchain itself also saw meaningful inflows in June, adding ~$5.1B in net digital assets. Nearly all of these new assets ( ~$5.0B ) originated from Coinbase’s Base L2, even as Base’s monthly DEX volumes declined ( -13% ). The fading AI-driven activity (e.g., VIRTUAL -26% ) likely drove this decline. 34% of Ethereum Transactions Involved Stablecoins in June, Driving Network Activity Near All-Time Highs Source: Glassnode as of 6/30/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. While perhaps defensive by crypto standards, this rotation into the L1 may not be bearish. Instead, it suggests that on-chain traders, primarily retail, are aligning with institutional investors’ renewed interest in Ethereum’s base layer. In June, stablecoins experienced a breakout moment following Circle’s IPO and the GENIUS Act’s advancement towards the House, with daily transactions rising (+7%) month-over-month and (+27%) year-over-year. Of the $125B in total stablecoin supply, Ethereum L1 hosts the majority (51%) and settles over ( 58%) of all stablecoin transaction volume ( 29% on ETH L1, 25% on Base, and 4% across Arbitrum, Mantle, and OP Mainnet). Meanwhile, Ethereum-native DeFi tokens such as Maple Finance ([[SYRUP]] +61% ), Sky ([[SKY]] +22% ), Uniswap ([[UNI]] +17 %), and Aave ([[AAVE]] +9% ) were among June’s top-performing tokens, underscoring how Ethereum’s legacy protocols are benefitting from real-world, stablecoin-driven financial applications. Accordingly, we believe the all-time high in NFT transfers on Ethereum is being driven not by JPEG art speculation, but by emergent use cases like tokenized real-world assets, digital identifiers, and on-chain debt instruments.

FTX officials announced that the second round of payments worth approximately $5 billion under the bankruptcy plan had officially begun. While FTX refunds were expected to continue gradually in the future, a new development occurred. FTX Recovery Trust has temporarily suspended payments to creditors in 49 foreign jurisdictions, Wu Blockchain reported. FTX is reportedly seeking court approval to honor creditor claims from users in 49 jurisdictions where cryptocurrencies are restricted or banned. According to a new filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, FTX has designated 49 countries as “Restricted Foreign Jurisdictions,” including China, Russia, Ukraine, and numerous Asian and African countries. Claims from creditors in those 49 countries will no longer go through a standard payment process; they will go straight to contested claims. This means FTX creditors may have to fight an additional legal battle to get their money back. According to the new development, FTX has requested court approval to handle refund requests from 49 jurisdictions where cryptocurrencies are banned or restricted. If the court approves, payments will continue. Otherwise, payments will stop and affected creditors may object.

Lone Wolf Bitcoin Miner Strikes Digital Gold As first flagged on X by journalist Pete Rizzo, block 903,883 was processed by an individual miner — something that rarely happens. According to Rizzo, the anonymous miner “beat incredible odds” on Thursday to mine the whole block. Dr CK, who is the administrator of the Solo.ckpool, a pool for independent miners and where this particular block was mined, congratulated the lucky miner, noting that they used just 2.3 petahashes to mine it. “A miner of this size has about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block every day, or once every 8 years on average,” the software engineer of the CK Miner pool postulated . According to Mempool Space, the miner bagged a big payout of 3.125 BTC, as well as 0.048 BTC in fees. That’s a grand total of ‎3.173 BTC. At Bitcoin’s price of about $108,700 per coin at the time of the block win, that adds up to a reward of around $349,028. Bitcoin miners, who process blocks on the top crypto’s network, are given newly minted coins: a 3.125 BTC fixed reward, along with the transaction fees paid by those using the payment system within that specific block window. The energy-intensive and expensive nature of Bitcoin mining usually leads to industrial-sized mining setups scoring the vast majority of block rewards. Many of these are public companies trading on U.S. stock exchanges. But every so often, a solo miner may get lucky and solve a block. The chances of doing this, though, are quite slim, and it has become akin to winning the lottery. In March, a lone miner struck it big on block 888,737 , which also yielded the 3.125 Bitcoin block reward and 0.032 BTC transaction fee — a payday of $266,000 at the time. Another solo miner hit the jackpot in early June, successfully mining block 899,826, earning a total reward worth $326,739.

2025-07-04T13:20:18,"Unlocking the Crypto Market: Altcoin Season Index at 23 Signals Bitcoin Dominance","BitcoinWorld Unlocking the Crypto Market: Altcoin Season Index at 23 Signals Bitcoin Dominance Are you wondering why your favorite altcoins aren’t seeing the parabolic gains you’ve heard so much about? The answer might lie in a crucial metric: the Altcoin Season Index. As of July 4, 00:30 UTC, this widely tracked cryptocurrency index, managed by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered a score of 23. This figure is down one point from the previous day, and it sends a clear signal across the crypto market: we are currently in a robust Bitcoin Season . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Compass for Crypto Market Trends The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it’s a vital indicator designed to help investors gauge the prevailing sentiment and capital flow within the digital asset space. It provides a snapshot of the market’s dynamics by comparing the performance of major cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin. Here’s how this insightful index works: Scope: The index specifically tracks the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to ensure a pure measure of market sentiment. Timeframe: It assesses the performance of these altcoins over the past 90 days relative to Bitcoin. This longer timeframe helps smooth out daily volatility and provides a more reliable trend indication. Thresholds: The index operates on a scale of 1 to 100. Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, a Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin within the same timeframe. A score of 23, as we see now, firmly places us in a Bitcoin-dominated environment. This means that, for the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins, Bitcoin has been the superior performer over the last three months. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for Your Portfolio? When the Altcoin Season Index points to a Bitcoin Season , it signifies a period where Bitcoin tends to consolidate its dominance, often outperforming most other digital assets. This phenomenon isn’t random; it’s typically driven by several factors: Flight to Safety: In times of market uncertainty or macroeconomic shifts, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer haven within the volatile crypto space due to its larger market cap, liquidity, and first-mover advantage. Pre-Halving Hype: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, historically precede periods of significant price appreciation, drawing capital into BTC. Institutional Interest: Large institutional investors often prefer Bitcoin due to its established infrastructure, regulatory clarity (in some jurisdictions), and higher liquidity compared to most altcoins. Capital Rotation: Sometimes, Bitcoin leads the initial rally in a bull market, and capital then rotates into altcoins later. Bitcoin Season often represents this initial phase or a period of consolidation before the broader market follows. For investors, a Bitcoin Season often means that focusing on Bitcoin itself or maintaining a higher allocation to BTC might be a prudent strategy. While some altcoins might still see individual pumps, the broader trend favors Bitcoin. Anticipating the Next Altcoin Season : What to Look For While we are currently in a Bitcoin Season, the crypto market is cyclical, and the pendulum will eventually swing back. Altcoin Season is the period every altcoin enthusiast eagerly awaits, characterized by explosive growth across a wide range of smaller cap assets. What typically triggers an Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Often, after a significant Bitcoin rally, BTC’s price will stabilize or consolidate, allowing capital to flow into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Technological Breakthroughs: New innovations, successful mainnet launches, or major protocol upgrades within specific altcoin ecosystems can spark interest and drive prices. Narrative Shifts: Emerging trends like DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, AI, or specific layer-2 solutions can create sector-specific rallies that pull up many related altcoins. Increased Risk Appetite: As market confidence grows, investors become more willing to take on higher risk in pursuit of greater gains offered by altcoins. Lower Bitcoin Dominance: A key indicator to watch is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). As BTC.D begins to decline significantly, it often signals that capital is moving out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. During an Altcoin Season, it’s not uncommon to see multiple altcoins delivering returns that far outpace Bitcoin, sometimes even 10x or 100x gains for select projects. However, this also comes with significantly higher risk. Maximizing Your Altcoin Performance : Strategies for Both Seasons Understanding the current market season is crucial for optimizing your investment strategy. Here are some actionable insights: During Bitcoin Season (like now): Focus on Bitcoin: Consider increasing your allocation to Bitcoin, as it’s likely to be the primary driver of market gains. Accumulate Altcoins Strategically: Use this period to research and accumulate promising altcoins at potentially lower prices. Look for projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) can be very effective here. Risk Management: Be mindful of the higher volatility in altcoins. Smaller positions and strict stop-loss orders can help protect your capital. Learn and Adapt: This is an excellent time to deepen your understanding of different altcoin projects and emerging narratives, preparing for the next shift. Preparing for Altcoin Season: Diversify Wisely: Once Bitcoin shows signs of consolidating after a major run, consider rotating some profits into a diversified basket of altcoins. Research Niche Narratives: Identify sectors that are gaining traction (e.g., AI tokens, RWA, gaming) and research leading projects within those niches. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep a close eye on the BTC.D chart. A clear downtrend is often a strong signal for altcoin outperformance. Be Prepared to Take Profits: Altcoin Season can be exhilarating, but it’s also where many investors fail to take profits. Have a profit-taking strategy in place to lock in gains. The Role of the Cryptocurrency Index in Your Investment Journey The Altcoin Season Index is just one example of a valuable cryptocurrency index that can inform your trading decisions. These indices provide a simplified view of complex market dynamics, helping you cut through the noise. Think of them as weather forecasts for the crypto market. While they don’t guarantee future performance, they offer strong indications of current conditions and potential shifts. By regularly checking the Altcoin Season Index, alongside other metrics like Bitcoin Dominance, market sentiment indicators (e.g., Fear & Greed Index), and on-chain data, you can build a more comprehensive understanding of where the market is headed. It’s important to remember that no single index tells the whole story. A holistic approach, combining macro-economic analysis with specific crypto-centric indicators, will always yield the best results. Conclusion: Navigating the Seasons with Confidence The Altcoin Season Index at 23 clearly signals that the crypto market is currently entrenched in a Bitcoin Season. This period calls for strategic patience, a focus on Bitcoin, and diligent research into promising altcoin projects that might flourish when the market sentiment shifts. Understanding the nuances between Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season, and the factors that drive them, empowers you to make more informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and ultimately, navigate the dynamic world of cryptocurrency with greater confidence.

2025-07-04T13:19:45,"HYPE breakout return may be on as freshly minted whale goes long on Hyperliquid","A new whale opened a 10X leveraged position on HYPE, as the token hovered around $38. After days of weakness, HYPE is setting expectations for a shift to a higher range. A newly created wallet set up a HYPE long position on Hyperliquid. The trader is unknown so far and bears no connection to the known wallets of Hyperliquid stars like James Wynn or Aguila Trades . Wynn has in fact sold some of his staked HYPE to fund further trading and is currently long on BTC . The brand-new whale deposited $4.16M USDC, which was initially funded through a null address. Later, the funds were used to go long on HYPE and for smaller spot purchases. A newly created wallet deposited $4.16M $USDC into #HyperLiquid and opened a $HYPE long position with 10x leverage. https://t.co/ar7KpMrQbb pic.twitter.com/b86gTfkwqk — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) July 4, 2025 The whale’s position is nominally valued at just above $2M , though the liquidation price is unknown. The whale position is considered relatively small and may not be directly attacked, yet remains a signal of faith in HYPE. A new Hyperliquid whale opened a 10X long position on Hype. | Source: Hyperliquid Previously, whales opened HYPE positions during the rally toward $45, but this time, long positions may be riskier. Most of HYPE activity is limited to Hyperliquid , leading to potential market manipulation. HYPE may see higher levels ahead HYPE is still within a small distance of its recent peak around $45. Open interest for HYPE is still around $1.6B, with no dramatic changes in the past few days. However, traders shifted to a 65% long positions against 35% short, suggesting an expected breakout. The long/short ratio for HYPE varies wildly. For most exchanges, the ratio is balanced, but on Hyperliquid, there is an anomalous predominance of shorts. The ratio is lower compared to all other exchanges, suggesting HYPE may also see a short squeeze. Additionally, HYPE is dissolving its limit order ceiling, with fewer traders posting limit orders at $50 . HYPE is seen as capable of moving to a higher range, mostly due to the predictable burning of fees. More bullish predictions see HYPE climb as high as $100 on direct whale purchases. Hyperliquid is also rising in the ranks, competing with older spot and derivative platforms. HYPE ownership is also a tool to share in the fees generated by Hyperliquid. The perpetual DEX platform produces up to $2M in daily fees, with consistent daily activity. Is Wintermute getting active on Hyperliquid? During its first year of rapid growth, Hyperliquid tapped demand from risky traders and anonymous whales. This time, the platform may be drawing in market makers. In the past day, a wallet identified as probably belonging to Wintermute bridged $8.3M in USDC from Arbitrum and deposited the stablecoins to Hyperliqiod. Wintermute’s main portfolio does not report any HYPE ownership. However, during previous market cycles, the leading market maker has also sold HYPE from the same wallet. Previous reports have estimated Wintermute holds around 4.17M HYPE and has frequently entered the market since January 2024. The actions of Wintermute have happened in the background, with rumors that the market maker is mostly long on HYPE. The recent inflow of USDC may add to the long positions on HYPE, setting expectations for a return to the previous levels above $40. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

It has acquired 74,315 Binance Coin (BNB) tokens through an OTC transaction valued at approximately $50 million. Nano Labs Bets Big on BNB This marks the first step in the company’s strategic BNB accumulation plan. Its long-term goal is to hold 5% to 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply, and it plans to allocate up to $1 billion to BNB. To support this goal, it plans to raise up to $500 million through convertible notes and private placement. With this purchase, Nano Labs’ reserves of major digital assets, including Bitcoin and BNB, now stand at around $160 million. It has also become the first U.S.-listed public company to adopt Binance Coin as a core treasury asset. This sets it apart from the typical corporate trend of holding Bitcoin or Ethereum. Notably, Nano Labs’ $50 million BNB purchase appears to be more than just a treasury move, it’s a shift away from its struggling hardware business. In the second half of 2024, the company’s revenue dropped 39% to $2.2 million, with losses totaling $8.4 million. With deep cost-cutting measures and R&D spending down 62%, the pivot to crypto looks more like a survival strategy than a bold expansion. BNB Gains Traction with Institutions Apart from Nano Labs, a group of former hedge fund executives also announced plans to raise $100 million to buy BNB through a Nasdaq-listed shell company. This shows rising institutional interest in the token. The rise of BNB as a treasury asset comes as more companies adopt altcoin-focused treasury strategies, echoing MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy. BNB Hints at Breakout Also, the rise in institutional interest has boosted BNB’s social dominance, which is now at a two-month high. If the momentum continues, its price could rally and break towards a new all-time high. BNB token is currently trading at $659.20. It is nearing a breakout as it trades within a symmetrical triangle pattern. Its overall technical indicators also lean bullish. The price is holding above key averages, and there is a potential for further gains if buying pressure continues.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/nano-labs-invests-50m-in-bnb-eyes-1-billion-in-treasury/,"BNB|REGULATION|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN","News|Altcoins|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T13:10:06,"Bitcoin Solo Mining: One Miner’s Miraculous $350,000 Jackpot","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Solo Mining: One Miner’s Miraculous $350,000 Jackpot Imagine hitting the lottery, not with a paper ticket, but with raw computing power. That’s precisely what happened recently when a single individual, engaged in Bitcoin solo mining , struck gold – or rather, Bitcoin – by successfully mining an entire block. This incredibly rare achievement saw them pocket the full 3.173 BTC Bitcoin block reward , an astonishing sum valued at nearly $350,000. It’s a story that underscores the unpredictable, yet exhilarating, nature of cryptocurrency mining and reignites the dreams of many in the digital asset space. What is Bitcoin Solo Mining, and Why Is It So Rare? In the vast and competitive world of Bitcoin, mining is the process by which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation and new transactions are added to the blockchain. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block to the blockchain and claims the block reward. Typically, individuals participate in mining pools, where their combined computing power (hash rate) increases their chances of solving a block. The reward is then shared among pool members proportionally to their contribution. Bitcoin solo mining , on the other hand, means an individual miner is going it alone, pitting their solitary hash rate against the entire global network. Given the immense difficulty of the Bitcoin network – which adjusts every two weeks to ensure a block is found approximately every 10 minutes – the odds of a single miner with modest equipment solving a block are astronomically low. It’s akin to buying a single lottery ticket and winning the grand prize. This recent event is truly a rare Bitcoin event , highlighting the sheer luck involved. The Unbelievable Bitcoin Block Reward: A Closer Look The core of this incredible story is the Bitcoin block reward itself. When a miner successfully adds a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain, they are compensated in two ways: newly minted bitcoins (the block subsidy) and transaction fees from all the transactions included in that block. At the time of this solo miner’s success, the block subsidy was 3.125 BTC, following Bitcoin’s fourth halving event in April 2024. The additional BTC, bringing the total to 3.173 BTC, came from accumulated transaction fees within that specific block. This payout, nearly $350,000 at the time of the report, represents a life-changing sum for most individuals. It’s a stark reminder of the potential financial upside in the world of BTC mining , even as it remains an increasingly professionalized and capital-intensive industry. The Cointelegraph report, shared on X, quickly went viral, capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Solo Mining vs. Pool Mining: A Strategic Choice for BTC Mining? The decision between solo mining and joining a mining pool is a critical one for anyone looking to engage in cryptocurrency mining . Each approach has its distinct advantages and disadvantages: Mining Pools: Pros: Consistent, smaller payouts. Higher probability of earning rewards due to combined hash rate. Lower variance in earnings. Cons: Fees charged by the pool operator. Rewards are shared, so individual payouts are smaller. Less control over which transactions are included in a block. Solo Mining: Pros: If successful, the miner receives the entire Bitcoin block reward . No pool fees. Complete control over the mining operation. Cons: Extremely low probability of success for most individual setups. High variance – long periods with no earnings. Requires significant upfront investment in powerful hardware and low-cost electricity to even have a minuscule chance. This solo miner’s success, while inspiring, does not necessarily make Bitcoin solo mining a viable strategy for the average person. It’s an outlier event, a testament to pure chance, rather than a blueprint for guaranteed success in BTC mining . Understanding the BTC Mining Lottery: Why This Was a Rare Bitcoin Event The mechanics of Bitcoin mining are fundamentally probabilistic. Every second, billions of guesses are made by miners worldwide to find the correct hash that solves the current block. The more hash rate (computing power) you contribute, the more guesses you can make, and thus, the higher your statistical probability of being the one to find the solution. The global Bitcoin network hash rate is enormous, measured in exahashes per second (EH/s) or even zetahashes per second (ZH/s). For a single miner to find a block, it means their relatively tiny portion of the total hash rate, perhaps a few terahashes per second (TH/s) or petahashes per second (PH/s), managed to randomly hit the winning number before anyone else. This is precisely why it’s considered a rare Bitcoin event and often compared to winning a lottery. The miner didn’t necessarily have a super-secret, ultra-powerful setup; they simply got incredibly lucky. It highlights the beauty and randomness inherent in the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Challenges and Dreams in Modern Cryptocurrency Mining While the dream of hitting a solo mining jackpot is alluring, the reality of modern cryptocurrency mining presents significant challenges. The industry has evolved into a highly professionalized sector dominated by large-scale operations with warehouses full of specialized Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners, access to cheap electricity, and sophisticated cooling systems. The initial investment required for competitive BTC mining hardware can be substantial, and ongoing operational costs, primarily electricity, are a constant concern. Despite these hurdles, stories like that of the successful solo miner keep the dream alive. They serve as a powerful reminder that while the odds are stacked against the individual, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin means that theoretically, anyone with the right equipment and a dash of extraordinary luck can participate and potentially reap massive rewards. It fuels the narrative of financial freedom and opportunity that drew many to Bitcoin in the first place. Is Solo Mining a Viable Path for You? Actionable Insights After hearing about this incredible Bitcoin solo mining success, you might be wondering if it’s a path you should explore. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Assess Your Resources: Do you have access to affordable electricity? Can you invest in high-efficiency ASIC miners? These are crucial for any form of cryptocurrency mining . Understand the Odds: For most individual setups, the probability of solo mining a block is extremely low, often equating to years or even decades of continuous operation without finding a single block. Consider Mining Pools: If your goal is consistent, albeit smaller, earnings, joining a reputable mining pool is almost always the more pragmatic and financially sensible approach for BTC mining . View Solo Mining as a Lottery Ticket: If you do decide to attempt solo mining, approach it with the mindset of buying a lottery ticket – the cost is an expense, and any return is pure bonus, not an expectation. Stay Informed: The mining landscape changes rapidly with network difficulty adjustments and hardware advancements. Keep up-to-date with industry news and best practices. This rare Bitcoin event is an anomaly, not a new trend. While inspiring, it shouldn’t overshadow the fundamental economics and probabilities of the Bitcoin network. Conclusion: A Beacon of Hope in the Bitcoin Landscape The story of the solo miner who defied astronomical odds to claim a 3.17 BTC Bitcoin block reward is nothing short of miraculous. It’s a powerful narrative that reminds us of the decentralized, permissionless, and sometimes wildly unpredictable nature of Bitcoin. While not a practical strategy for most aspiring miners, this rare Bitcoin event serves as a potent symbol of hope and the enduring allure of striking it rich in the digital gold rush. It reinforces the idea that in the world of cryptocurrency mining , even against all odds, extraordinary things can happen. It’s a truly captivating moment in the history of BTC mining , sure to be recounted for years to come.

The MATIC price could reach a maximum of $0.47181 in 2025. POL price with a potential surge may reach a high of $4.94731 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network’s high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL’s price value, too. Through POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framework of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction.

Following a brief boost of 9% in early July from the last week of June due to geopolitical easing, the price is currently testing this critical resistance level. If POL fails to break through the 20-day EMA, it could retreat to $0.15, with further bearish pressure potentially pushing it below $0.10. However, if conditions improve and POL successfully flips both the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands, a retest of the 0.236 Fibonacci level at $0.30 could be on the horizon in July. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Polygon Price Action July 2025 $0.10 $0.20 $0.30 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 The POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE reveals a stark reality: since December 2024, the price has plummeted over 70%, with Q1 2025 significantly contributing to this decline. However, a shift occurred in April 2025 as bullish forces began to emerge, pushing the price to the 0.236 level-based resistance by mid-May. Despite these efforts, Polygon remained low on the list of altcoins, showing muted growth compared to its peers during Q2. This brief period of optimism was short-lived, as bears took control from mid-May to the third week of June, dragging the price back down to April’s lows. This movement indicates a lack of bullish conviction in the short term. Yet, the last week of June brought a glimmer of hope, with geopolitical easing sparking a 9% boost by early July. Currently, the POL price is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA band. If it fails to break through this level, the price could retreat to $0.15, and further bearish pressure could push it below $0.10. These developments have unfolded against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s presidential start in 2025, during which market participants have witnessed multiple conflicts, resulting in bearish dominance. Nevertheless, if conditions improve and POL manages to flip both the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands, a retest of the 0.236 Fibonacci level could be on the horizon in July. In a more optimistic scenario, the chances of clearing the 0.50 Fibonacci level have increased in the long term, potentially leading to targets at the 0.786 and even the 1.0 Fibonacci levels by the end of 2025. Additionally, the RSI has entered oversold territory, and with the recent intraday rise, it has begun to reverse, indicating a growing bullish sentiment in the short term.

2025-07-04T13:01:32,"Chinese Tech Giants JD and Ant Group Push Central Bank to Launch Yuan Stablecoins Against Dollar Dominance","Chinese e-commerce companies JD and Ant Group have been petitioning the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to approve Yuan-based stablecoins, aiming to compete with US dollar stablecoins that currently dominate the market. E-commerce companies suggest that the PBOC should allow Hong Kong to circulate Yuan stablecoins to strengthen the currency globally and push back against US dollar stablecoins. JD executives met with PBOC officials to emphasize the importance of stablecoins in promoting global currencies. Currently, most stablecoins in circulation are pegged to the US dollar. US stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, represent over 99% of the stablecoin ecosystem. This presents a problem for economists who wish to promote a multipolar world. US dollar stablecoins may have dominated the market because exchanges used them to facilitate trades between pairs, such as those involving BTC and USDT. The US dollar was likely used because most of the early Bitcoin developers were based in the United States. It makes sense to have Yuan stablecoins because China is the second-largest economy in the world and may soon overtake the United States. However, according to SWIFT data, US dollar trades represent 48.46% of the market, while Yuan trades represent only 2.89% of the market. SWIFT is an ISO accredited international payment system. Wang Yongli, the former head of the Bank of China, stated that if Yuan payments remain less efficient than US dollar payments, China will be exposed to strategic risk. Yuan global payments, according to SWIFT, declined to 2.89% in May, the lowest level in two years. Whereas, US dollar global payments remained steady at 48%. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has made strides in promoting blockchain technologies. Hong Kong has released a strategic blueprint to promote Web3 technologies in the local region and develop talent by incentivising training programs. The blueprint described blockchain and web3 technologies as superpowers and called for leaders in the private sector to work with the government to address key priorities that benefit everyone. Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOK), said last month that the boom in digital currencies and stablecoins poses large problems for regulators. PBOK has entertained the idea of an offshore Yuan stablecoin operating in Hong Kong. Ant Group, the FinTech wing of Alibaba, has already made plans to obtain licenses for stablecoin use in Hong Kong. Ant Group has also begun preparing for a possible offshore Yuan stablecoin as part of its adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology. JD, an e-commerce giant, has announced plans to obtain licenses for stablecoins, enabling cross-border payments and currency exchanges. These Chinese companies seem to be investing in stablecoin technology and would like to add Yuan-based digital assets to their list. China, meanwhile, has been promoting a multipolar world and win-win trade, as opposed to zero-sum games where one economy dominates world trade. PBOK governor Pan Gongsheng believes that a single currency use creates geopolitical risk for international trade. For this reason PBOK may take the advice from Ant Group and JD seriously, seeing US dollar dominance with stablecoins as a major risk factor. Stablecoins have experienced significant growth and are poised to expand globally. It may make sense to allow Yuan-based stablecoins to compete with other stablecoins, thereby balancing the playing field and providing consumers with more choices. China has been making efforts to create financial infrastructure that is independent of Western systems. Many investors have been shifting their focus to European and Asian markets to mitigate the negative effects of President Trump’s tariffs. Yuan-based stablecoins may further enable traders to invest in the Chinese market. Stablecoins are extremely useful for making international trades.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/chinese-tech-giants-jd-and-ant-group-push-central-bank-to-launch-yuan-stablecoins-against-dollar-dominance/,"ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|China|Stablecoins|US Dollar|Yuan",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T13:00:58,"FTX Bankruptcy: The Shocking Truth About Global Crypto Compensation Exclusion","BitcoinWorld FTX Bankruptcy: The Shocking Truth About Global Crypto Compensation Exclusion The saga of the FTX collapse continues to unfold, bringing with it fresh revelations that underscore the inherent risks and complexities of the cryptocurrency world. For countless individuals who saw their digital assets evaporate overnight, the hope of recovery has been a fragile beacon. However, a recent court document in the ongoing FTX bankruptcy case has cast a long, somber shadow over this hope for users in nearly 50 countries and regions. This development highlights the harsh realities of cross-border financial distress and the fragmented landscape of global crypto regulation . FTX Bankruptcy: The Unfortunate Reality for Global Users A document filed on July 2 in the complex FTX bankruptcy proceedings has revealed a list of 49 countries and regions where users may find themselves entirely excluded from receiving any form of compensation. This distressing news, initially reported by JinSe Finance and shared widely on X by @biteye_sister, confirms the worst fears for a significant portion of FTX’s former user base. The reasons behind these exclusions are rooted in a mosaic of local laws that either outright prohibit crypto trading or block access to services from offshore platforms like FTX. Imagine the despair of having your funds locked away, only to discover that your geographic location now acts as an impenetrable barrier to recovery. This situation underscores a critical challenge in the decentralized yet globally interconnected crypto ecosystem: the clash between national sovereignty and borderless digital transactions. For users in these restricted jurisdictions, the path to reclaiming their lost digital assets appears to be a dead end, leaving them with little recourse. China’s Crypto Conundrum: A Significant Impact on Crypto Compensation Among the 49 jurisdictions, one country stands out with a particularly devastating impact: China. The court document suggests that an astonishing 82% of the affected claims originate from China. This figure is not merely a statistic; it represents hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of individual users who poured their savings into what they believed was a secure platform, only to be met with a double blow – the platform’s collapse and their government’s restrictive policies. China’s stringent stance on cryptocurrency trading and related activities has been well-documented. The government has progressively tightened its grip on the crypto market, culminating in a comprehensive ban on all crypto transactions and mining activities. While these measures were ostensibly put in place to mitigate financial risks and maintain economic stability, they now inadvertently serve as a formidable barrier for its citizens seeking crypto compensation from international bankruptcies. This scenario serves as a stark reminder of how local regulatory environments can profoundly impact the recovery prospects for global users of offshore platforms . Navigating the FTX Claims Process: What Displaced Users Need to Know For those not on the exclusion list, the journey to recovering digital assets from the FTX bankruptcy is still fraught with challenges. The process of an international bankruptcy is notoriously slow, complex, and often yields only a fraction of the original investment. Users are typically required to: File a formal claim: This involves providing detailed proof of ownership and the extent of their holdings on the platform. Stay informed about court proceedings: Updates are often released through official bankruptcy websites and legal filings, which can be dense and difficult to interpret. Be prepared for delays: Multi-jurisdictional bankruptcies can take years, if not a decade, to resolve, as creditors from various regions vie for a share of the remaining assets. Understand the hierarchy of claims: Secured creditors, employees, and various other parties often have priority over individual retail investors, further diminishing the potential for full recovery. The situation for excluded users, however, is far more grim. Their exclusion from crypto compensation highlights a critical gap in international legal frameworks concerning digital assets and the urgent need for a more harmonized approach to global crypto regulation . The Broader Implications of FTX’s Collapse on Global Crypto Regulation The FTX collapse and its subsequent bankruptcy proceedings have served as a wake-up call for regulators worldwide. The exclusion of users from compensation based on their geographic location underscores the urgent need for clearer, more consistent international standards for crypto exchanges and digital asset custody. Without such frameworks, the risks associated with using offshore platforms remain substantial. Key implications include: Increased scrutiny of offshore exchanges: Regulators are likely to intensify their oversight of exchanges operating across borders, potentially leading to stricter licensing requirements and greater data sharing. Push for localized regulation: Countries may be incentivized to develop more robust domestic regulatory frameworks for crypto, making it harder for international platforms to operate without local compliance. Emphasis on consumer protection: The plight of excluded users will undoubtedly fuel calls for enhanced consumer protection mechanisms in the crypto space, including clearer guidelines on asset segregation and bankruptcy procedures. This event serves as a powerful argument for why a unified approach to global crypto regulation is not just desirable but essential for the long-term health and stability of the crypto market. Protecting Your Digital Assets: Lessons from the FTX Fiasco For all crypto enthusiasts, the FTX saga offers invaluable, albeit painful, lessons on how to protect their digital assets . While the allure of high returns and easy access to trading can be strong, the risks of centralized, unregulated entities are now clearer than ever. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Self-Custody: Whenever possible, store your significant crypto holdings in hardware wallets or other forms of self-custody where you control your private keys. As the saying goes, “not your keys, not your coins.” Diversify Your Holdings: Avoid putting all your funds into one exchange or even one type of crypto asset. Spread your investments across various platforms and asset classes. Understand Regulatory Environments: Be aware of the crypto regulations in your own country and in the jurisdictions where your chosen exchanges operate. This knowledge can save you from unforeseen exclusions in times of crisis. Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Before depositing funds onto any platform, research its security practices, regulatory compliance, and track record. Look for transparent auditing and clear terms of service. Be Wary of High Yields: If an investment promises unusually high returns, it often comes with equally high, if not higher, risks. Exercise caution and skepticism. The pain of losing crypto compensation is immense, and these lessons, while learned the hard way by many, are crucial for fostering a more resilient and secure crypto community. A Lingering Cloud Over Crypto’s Promise The revelation that users in 49 jurisdictions may receive no crypto compensation from the FTX bankruptcy is a stark and painful reminder of the volatility and regulatory uncertainties that still plague the digital asset space. While the crypto world promises decentralization and financial freedom, the reality of centralized exchanges and disparate national laws can lead to devastating consequences. The plight of Chinese users, who account for the vast majority of excluded claims, underscores the complex interplay between innovation, national policy, and global financial justice.

2025-07-04T13:00:17,"Solana Whale Moves $152 Million In One Splash—What’s Going On?","According to on‑chain tracker Whale Alert, an unknown wallet just received 1,000,000 SOL in a single move worth over $152 million. It all happened in a flash. The report set off alarms across the Solana network and sent traders scrambling. Related Reading: Under Stress: Tron Revenue Drops As Nearly $190M Flows Out Activity shot up almost immediately as everyone tried to figure out who was behind the transfer and why it mattered. Massive Transfer Caught On Chain Based on reports, the one‑million‑SOL transfer lifted 24‑hour trading volume to $4.11 billion, a nearly 28% rise. Large moves of this size—more than $152 million at current prices—often reshape order‑book depth and liquidity as traders adjust their positions in response. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 1,000,000 #SOL (152,067,512 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/Mkaq1mDBPn — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 2, 2025 Price Rally Tops $150 Barrier Traders watched SOL climb from about $146 to $151, up 6.10% in the last week. Some snapped up coins at $150, betting that the whale’s shift in assets hinted at a larger play. Others took profits as the price crossed that round number, locking in gains. Either way, breaking above $150 marked a clear sign that short‑term momentum was back. It even pulled in fresh players looking for quick wins. US‑Listed Solana ETF Gains Traction On the same day, a new staking‑enabled Solana ETF went live on Cboe BZX. It started with $33 million in trades on its very first session. That outpaced many earlier crypto futures products, pushing more faith into SOL as an investment option. Based on reports, traditional investors who were on the fence now had a regulated path to add Solana to their portfolios without jumping through extra hoops. This double whammy—whale wallet shuffle and a fresh ETF—did more than bake a rally; it gave the market two clear signals. First, smart money still moves big chunks behind the scenes. Second, regulated products keep gaining ground in the crypto space.

2025-07-04T13:00:01,"New Research Predicts Ethereum At $706,000—ETH’s Wildest Target Yet","A newly published, 38-page research titled The Bull Case for ETH contends that Ethereum (ETH) could ultimately command a fully diluted market capitalization of roughly $85 trillion, implying a long-run price near $706,000 per coin. The work—dated June 2025 and signed by twenty-one contributors including core researcher Danny Ryan, Bankless co-founder Ryan Sean Adams, and investor Vivek Raman—seeks to re-frame ETH as “digital oil”: a yield-bearing, deflationary reserve asset that simultaneously powers and secures the emerging on-chain economy. The authors open with the claim that the global financial system “is on the cusp of a generational transformation, as assets worldwide become digitized and transition on-chain.” In this transition, they argue, Ethereum has “emerged as [the] foundation” because it combines the deepest developer community with “unparalleled reliability and zero downtime.” Yet, they add, ETH the asset “remains among the most significantly mispriced opportunities in global markets today,” still trading well below its 2021 peak despite a series of technical upgrades and solidifying dominance in tokenized assets and stable-coin settlement. “ETH is the next generational asymmetric investment opportunity, positioned to emerge as a core holding for institutional digital-asset portfolios,” the report states. “It is digital oil—the fuel, collateral, and reserve asset powering the internet’s new financial system.” Framing Ethereum Against Traditional Stores Of Value To reach the headline valuation, the study compares Ethereum’s native asset with four established reservoirs of value: proven crude-oil reserves (~ $85 trillion), gold (~ $22 trillion), the global bond market (~ $141 trillion) and worldwide broad money supply, M2 (~ $93 trillion). averaging those four benchmarks yields an indicative “long-term potential” of $85 trillion for ETH’s aggregate valuation, or roughly $706,000 per coin. The authors emphasise that this figure is not a price target on a timetable but rather an end-state equilibrium if Ethereum succeeds in acting simultaneously as energy commodity, monetary metal, sovereign-grade collateral and base-layer money for a digital economy. Crucial to their thesis is Ethereum’s monetary design. Gross issuance tops out at 1.51 percent of supply per year, while roughly 80 percent of transaction fees are destroyed, driving net issuance toward deflation as on-chain activity rises. Since the September 2022 merge to proof-of-stake, the study notes, effective supply growth has hovered near 0.09 percent—lower than both fiat money and Bitcoin. The report frames this programme as “predictable scarcity” that contrasts with Bitcoin’s hard-cap model, which the authors argue may eventually under-incentivise miners and weaken Bitcoin’s security budget. Another pillar is staking yield : validators earn base issuance plus a share of fees for securing the chain, making staked ETH “a productive, yield-bearing digital commodity.” The paper likens that yield to gold-lending revenue or oil-reserve leasing, but emphasises that, unlike those physical commodities, ETH’s yield is natively programmable and automatically compounding. Roughly 32.6 percent of the current ETH supply already serves as collateral in DeFi or enterprise infrastructure, while an additional 3.5 percent has migrated to other blockchains. As tokenized real-world assets proliferate, the authors foresee rising demand for a “globally neutral, censorship-resistant reserve asset” within settlement protocols—an economic role they argue only ETH can fill without external counterparty risk. Near-Term And Medium-Term Milestones For ETH While the ultimate scenario envisions a six-figure ETH, the study outlines interim milestones: a “short-term” price of $8,000 (~US $1 trillion market cap) and a “medium-term” level of $80,000 (~US $10 trillion). Four catalysts are identified: First, the rapid tokenization of real-world assets and institutional on-chain infrastructure. Second is the institutional appetite for native staking yield, especially once staked-ETH exchange-traded funds come to market. The third argument is the “race to stockpile ETH,” evidenced by an embryonic strategic-reserve pool that already counts nearly US $2 billion in publicly disclosed holdings. Moreover, the authors predict growing use of ETH in treasury management , where its neutrality, programmability and yield allow automated collateral, escrows and payments. “ETH stands alone as the neutral reserve asset uniquely positioned to secure and power the global tokenized financial system,” the authors write, characterising the current market price as “a temporary mispricing, not a structural weakness.” However, the report’s authors also concede that Ethereum’s complexity makes valuation “more challenging” than Bitcoin’s simpler digital-gold narrative. They also warn that ETH cannot be modelled like a technology equity: discounted-cash-flow methods capture neither ETH’s commodity burn nor its role as base-layer collateral. Nevertheless, they argue that multipronged utility—fuel, store of value, collateral and yield—creates an upside “which could even surpass Bitcoin’s.” In their words, ETH is “an entirely new category of asset,” requiring comparables drawn from energy, monetary metals, sovereign bonds and global money supplies rather than from fee-generating software platforms.

2025-07-04T12:56:55,"Hyperliquid price outlook: Bulls need volume to break $40 ceiling","Hyperliquid faces repeated rejection at the $40 resistance zone. Despite its bullish structure, the lack of breakout volume suggests consolidation will persist until a decisive move confirms a new trend. Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) has exhibited strong bullish momentum in recent weeks, but current price action signals exhaustion as the token struggles to break through the $40 psychological resistance. This level has been tested multiple times without an impulsive breakout, suggesting that sellers remain firmly in control of this zone. While the broader trend remains intact, the recent lack of breakout volume and the inability to surpass this resistance increase the likelihood of continued range-bound price action in the near term. Key technical points $40 Resistance Zone: Strong psychological and structural resistance tapped multiple times without confirmation. $30 Swing Low Support: Liquidity zone that remains untested and could attract price for a sweep. $26 Key Level: Deeper support zone with potential for reversal if tapped on volume spike. HYPEUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Hyperliquid’s ongoing struggle at the $40 mark reveals underlying weakness in momentum. This resistance level has now served as a ceiling for several weeks, with each test resulting in either weak rejection candles or failed follow-through. In the absence of an impulsive breakout and volume confirmation, it is unlikely that bulls will regain short-term control. Technically, this heightens the probability of rejection and a return to lower support zones. The $30 swing low stands out as a key liquidity level that has yet to be tapped during recent rotations. A sweep of this level could act as a liquidity grab, a common occurrence before a reversal higher. If selling pressure persists, the $26 level comes into focus as a major structural support zone where a high-probability bounce setup could form. You might also like: Amber International raises over a quarter of $100m goal to boost crypto holdings Although Hyperliquid has sustained an overall bullish trend, its inability to clear the $40 mark is currently capping further upside. Until a breakout occurs with strong volume, the token is likely to continue oscillating within the broader $26–$40 range. Volume remains the missing catalyst, and any legitimate breakout or breakdown will require a noticeable increase in either buying or selling pressure. What to expect in the coming price action Hyperliquid is likely to remain range-bound between $26 and $40 until volume validates a breakout. A sweep of the $30 level could prompt a short-term bounce, but genuine bullish continuation hinges on a convincing move above $40.

2025-07-04T12:56:09,"Bitcoin Climbs as Trump’s $5 Trillion Bill Sparks Market Volatility and Political Tensions: Your Weekly Crypto Market Update","Bitcoin had a relatively strong week, which helped it end the second quarter with almost 30% gains and trading around $109,000 by July 4th – pretty close to its all-time highs. The price briefly dipped to around $105K midweek following the Senate’s approval of Donald Trump’s massive budget legislation but it was quick to rebound. Analysts remain split on the short-term outlook: Standard Chartered maintains a positive view with a $200,000 year-end target, while BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes warns of a potentail dip to $90K before another rally. The major political development during this week was the passage of Trump’s $5 trillion legislation “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which makes the 2017 individual tax cuts permanent, lifts the debt ceiling, and rolls back programs such as Medicaid expansion and green energy incentives. After a narrow vote in the Senate on July 1st, the House approved the bill on July 3rd, following a lengthy Democratic nailbiter. Trump is expected to sign the bill on July 4th. The crypto market reacted with a temporary weakness. However, many see the bill’s inflationary impact, as well as the ballooning US debt as a long-term bullish sign for Bitcoin. Similar fiscal stimulus packages in the past (recall the 2020 COVID relief efforts) led to sharp crypto market rallies. Hence, some analysts believe that this could be a comparable setup. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized the bill’s cuts to clean energy and its impact on federal debt. He even went so far to suggest that he might create a third political party in response. Trump, of course, fired back, suggesting Musk could even face deportation, which escalated tensions between both of them. Other notable developments include the removal of a crypto tax relief amendment, which disappointed miners and stakers. However, the discussions around a US strategic Bitcoin reserve continue to gain moment. While Bitcoin is currently holding strong, regulatory uncertainty, macro shifts, and political risks remain some of the key variables for the coming weeks.

2025-07-04T12:50:55,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unwavering Optimism as Market Stays in Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unwavering Optimism as Market Stays in Greed Zone In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, understanding the collective mood of investors can be as crucial as analyzing price charts. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a widely recognized barometer of market sentiment, has consistently held its ground at 73 as of July 4. This sustained reading firmly places the market in the ‘Greed’ zone, indicating a prevailing sense of optimism and perhaps even euphoria among participants. But what does this unwavering optimism truly signify for the future of the crypto market? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does 73 Mean? Developed by software platform Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a vital tool for investors and analysts alike, providing a snapshot of the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Its scale ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ – a period of high anxiety and potential capitulation – and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed,’ often associated with market tops and irrational exuberance. A reading of 73, as observed, indicates a strong leaning towards ‘Greed.’ This suggests that investors are feeling confident, perhaps even overly optimistic, about future price movements. Historically, periods of extreme greed can precede market corrections, as assets may become overvalued due to speculative buying. Conversely, extreme fear often presents prime buying opportunities when assets are undervalued due to panic selling. The index is not just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key factors designed to capture the multifaceted nature of crypto market sentiment. These factors provide a comprehensive view, moving beyond mere price action to understand the underlying psychology driving investor behavior. Navigating Crypto Market Sentiment: Is Greed Good? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes a high ‘Greed’ score, it sparks a crucial question for many: Is this a positive sign of a healthy bull run, or a cautionary signal of an impending downturn? The answer, as often in financial markets, is nuanced. On one hand, sustained greed can indicate strong buying pressure and robust market momentum, pushing prices higher. This can be exhilarating for investors who are already in the market, seeing their portfolios grow. However, seasoned investors often recall the famous adage attributed to Warren Buffett: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” A high greed reading suggests that many market participants are already heavily invested, potentially with less room for new capital to flow in, and perhaps less caution being exercised. This can lead to speculative bubbles where assets trade above their intrinsic value, making them vulnerable to sharp corrections at the slightest negative news. Therefore, while the current sentiment points to strong bullish conviction, it also warrants a degree of prudence. It’s a time for investors to review their strategies, perhaps consider taking some profits, or at least ensure their risk management protocols are firmly in place. How Does Bitcoin Price Influence the Index? Bitcoin, as the pioneering and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often acts as the bellwether for the entire crypto market. Its price movements and dominance significantly sway the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. One of the six contributing factors to the index is Bitcoin dominance, which accounts for 10% of the overall score. This factor measures Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market cap. When Bitcoin’s price experiences a strong upward trend, it typically pulls the entire market with it, fostering a sense of optimism and pushing the index into the ‘Greed’ zone. Conversely, a significant drop in Bitcoin’s price can trigger widespread fear, dragging the index down. The stability of Bitcoin’s price, or a steady upward trajectory, often underpins the overall positive market analysis reflected in the index. It’s important to note that while Bitcoin is a major influence, the index considers other factors to provide a holistic view, ensuring it’s not solely reliant on one asset’s performance. Beyond the Numbers: Deep Dive into Market Analysis Factors The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a single number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of various market indicators, each contributing to the final score. Understanding these components offers a deeper insight into what truly shapes the prevailing sentiment: Volatility (25%): This factor measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, while stable or rising prices with controlled volatility can indicate greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component assesses the current volume and market momentum. High trading volumes and strong positive momentum typically indicate a greedy market, as more money flows in. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes cryptocurrency-related hashtags and mentions on various social media platforms, looking for the speed and quantity of posts, and sentiment analysis of those posts. A surge in positive, hyped mentions points to greed. Surveys (15%): Historically, this factor involved polling investors to gauge their sentiment. However, it’s currently paused, meaning its contribution to the overall score is temporarily excluded. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): As discussed, this measures Bitcoin’s market cap share. A rising dominance can sometimes signal fear (as investors flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin), while a falling dominance can indicate greed (as altcoins gain traction). In the context of the overall index, its interplay with other factors determines its final impact. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes Google search queries related to cryptocurrencies. A sudden surge in search terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto bubble’ suggests fear, while generic, high-volume searches might indicate growing public interest and potential greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index provides a robust and dynamic measure of market psychology, making it an invaluable resource for informed decision-making. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investing: When to Act? For those engaged in crypto investing, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers more than just an interesting statistic; it provides actionable insights. While it should never be the sole basis for investment decisions, it serves as an excellent complementary tool: Counter-Cyclical Investing: When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (low numbers), it might signal a good time to accumulate assets at potentially discounted prices, as panic selling often leads to undervaluation. Conversely, when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (high numbers, like the current 73), it could be a prudent time to consider taking profits or reducing exposure, as the market may be nearing a peak. Risk Management: A high greed score should prompt investors to re-evaluate their risk exposure. Are you over-leveraged? Is your portfolio too concentrated in highly speculative assets? This is a time to solidify stop-loss orders and perhaps diversify. Avoid FOMO: The ‘Greed’ zone often fuels Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). The index can serve as a reminder to resist impulsive buying at inflated prices, encouraging a more disciplined approach. Validate Other Signals: Use the index to validate other technical or fundamental analyses. If your charts show an overbought market and the index confirms high greed, it strengthens the case for caution. Ultimately, the index empowers investors to make more emotionally intelligent decisions, rather than being swept away by market euphoria or despair. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, steadfast at 73 and firmly rooted in the ‘Greed’ zone, continues to be a powerful indicator of the prevailing optimism in the crypto market. While this unwavering sentiment can fuel further growth, it also serves as a crucial reminder for investors to balance enthusiasm with prudence. By understanding the underlying factors that drive this index and integrating its insights into a broader market analysis strategy, participants can navigate the volatile crypto landscape with greater confidence and make more informed decisions about their crypto investing journey. Always remember, the market’s mood is just one piece of the puzzle; comprehensive research and risk management remain paramount.

2025-07-04T12:50:31,"Bitcoin Options: Urgent Warning as $3 Billion Expiration Looms","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Options: Urgent Warning as $3 Billion Expiration Looms Get ready for a significant event in the cryptocurrency world! On July 4, nearly $3 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire, a moment that often brings increased attention and potential shifts to the market. This isn’t just about Bitcoin; around $612 million in Ethereum options will also mature on the same day. For traders and enthusiasts alike, understanding these expiries is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of digital assets. Understanding the Massive Options Expiration Event Options contracts are a fascinating part of the derivatives market, giving traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. When a large volume of these contracts reaches their expiration date, it can create significant ripple effects across the market. The sheer scale of the upcoming options expiration on July 4th for both Bitcoin and Ethereum makes it a focal point for many. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key figures: Bitcoin (BTC) Options: Value: Approximately $3 billion Expiration Time: 08:00 UTC on July 4 Put/Call Ratio: 1.05 Max Pain Price: $106,000 Ethereum (ETH) Options: Value: Around $612 million Expiration Time: 08:00 UTC on July 4 Put/Call Ratio: 1.24 Max Pain Price: $2,500 The put/call ratio provides insight into market sentiment. A ratio above 1 indicates more put options (bets on price decline) than call options (bets on price increase), suggesting a more bearish sentiment among options traders for that particular asset. Bitcoin’s ratio of 1.05 and Ethereum’s 1.24 both lean slightly bearish, indicating a cautious stance from derivatives participants. What is the ‘ Max Pain Price ‘ and Why Does It Matter? The term ‘ max pain price ‘ might sound ominous, but it’s a critical concept in options trading. It refers to the price point at which the largest number of options traders would incur financial losses if the underlying asset settles at that value upon expiration. In simpler terms, it’s the strike price where the most open options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless, causing maximum financial suffering for the majority of options holders. For the upcoming expiration: Bitcoin’s max pain price is currently set at a staggering $106,000. Ethereum’s max pain price is $2,500. While the market doesn’t always gravitate towards the max pain price, it’s a closely watched metric because large options writers (those who sell options) might have an incentive to try and push the price towards this level to maximize their profits. This dynamic can sometimes contribute to increased crypto market volatility around expiration dates. How Might This Options Expiration Impact the Crypto Market Volatility ? Large options expiries can often be catalysts for increased crypto market volatility . Here’s why: Hedging Activities: Large institutional players and whales who have significant options positions might engage in hedging activities in the spot market as expiration approaches. For example, if they have sold a large number of call options, they might buy the underlying asset to cover their potential obligations, or vice versa for put options. This can lead to increased buying or selling pressure. Price Discovery: The resolution of open interest from options can lead to a period of price discovery. Once the uncertainty of expiration passes, the market might react to the new positioning of traders and the flow of capital. Sentiment Shift: If the market settles far from the max pain price, or if the put/call ratio shifts dramatically, it could signal a change in broader market sentiment, impacting future price movements. Liquidation Risks: In highly leveraged positions, sudden price movements around expiration could trigger liquidations, adding to market instability. It’s important to note that while options expiration can influence price action, it’s just one of many factors. Macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and broader market sentiment also play significant roles in determining the direction of Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Actionable Insights for Traders as July 4 Approaches Given the significant Bitcoin options and Ethereum options expiry, what should traders and investors consider? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Price Action Closely: Be prepared for potential heightened volatility around 08:00 UTC on July 4. Sudden spikes or dips are not uncommon as options positions are settled. Understand Your Risk: If you are involved in options trading, ensure you understand the implications of your positions expiring. For spot traders, be mindful of potential increased price swings and consider setting stop-loss orders. Watch Max Pain and Put/Call Ratios: While not a definitive predictor, monitoring the max pain price and put/call ratios can offer clues about the positioning of large options players and their potential influence on price. Look Beyond the Expiry: The immediate aftermath of an expiry can be just as important as the event itself. Markets often consolidate or find new direction once the derivatives overhang is cleared. Diversify and Research: As always, maintaining a diversified portfolio and conducting thorough research before making any trading decisions remains paramount. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially during periods of anticipated volatility. In Conclusion: Navigating the Derivatives Landscape The upcoming $3 billion Bitcoin options and $612 million Ethereum options expiration on July 4 is a noteworthy event that highlights the growing maturity and complexity of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. While the ‘max pain price’ and put/call ratios offer intriguing insights into trader positioning, the actual market reaction will depend on a confluence of factors. Understanding these dynamics, especially the potential for increased crypto market volatility , empowers participants to make more informed decisions. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a long-term holder, staying informed about such significant derivatives events is key to navigating the ever-evolving world of digital assets. The crypto market continues to evolve, and with it, the tools and strategies required to succeed.

2025-07-04T12:49:07,"Remarkable Activity in Two Bitcoin Wallets That Have Been Inactive for 14 Years! Thousands of Bitcoins Transferred! Here Are the Details","There has been a rare flurry of activity on the Bitcoin blockchain. According to on-chain data, two Bitcoin wallets that have been dormant for 14 years have transferred a total of 20,000 BTC (about $2.18 billion) to other addresses. Bitcoin Wallets Recover After 14 Years: 20,000 BTC Moved These addresses first appeared on April 3, 2011, in a transaction made by a wallet named “1HqXB…gDwcK.” In the transaction in question, 23,377.83 BTC were sent to three different addresses. Two addresses received 10,000 BTC, while the third address was left with 3,377.83 BTC. These two large recipient wallets (“12tLs…xj2me” and “1KbrS…AWJYm”) have not made any transactions since then. However, this changed on Thursday night and early Friday morning. Both addresses moved their 10,000 BTC balances to new addresses within 30 minutes of each other. Interestingly, the BTCs sent to these addresses were recorded as the first and only incoming transactions for these wallets. The new addresses that were sent to have not shown any activity for now. It remains unknown whether these two wallets belong to the same person or different people. There is also no information about the reason for the transfers. However, the striking point is this: These 20,000 BTC, which were worth $ 7,800 in 2011, are now worth approximately $ 2.18 billion, indicating a tremendous increase in value of 13,982,800%. While such old wallet movements often cause excitement and speculation in the markets, some experts evaluate that these transfers may be cold wallet updates or inheritance transactions made for security purposes. *This is not investment advice.

As multiple on-chain and institutional signals flash bullish indications, the market narrative around BTC price is evolving again and this time, it’s looking even stronger than ever before. New Whale Activity Signals Aggressive Accumulation In Bitcoin A major reveal in whale behavior is catching the crypto community’s attention very strongly. According to a post by analyst MisterrCrypto, a metric tracked by CryptoQuant has recently showcased that new whales are buying Bitcoin at unprecedented levels in 2025. This advancement in activity is a clear indicative of heightened conviction among fresh institutional and high-net-worth entrants. New whales are buying more Bitcoin than ever before. Extremely bullish signal! pic.twitter.com/saw6a2stlx — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) July 4, 2025 Just hours before this insight, spotonchain shared jaw-dropping on-chain data, where he mentioned a legendary Bitcoin whale. The post revealed that this whale, dormant for over 14 years, has resurfaced and has transferred its stash of 10,000 BTC coins, currently worth over $1.09 billion, to a new wallet. The whale reportedly acquired this stash in 2011 at just $0.78 per BTC, making it as one of the most profitable dormant addresses ever recorded so far in history, with an unrealized return of more than 140,000x is a real big deal. This two-fold signal has injected some serious confidence into an already heated Bitcoin market. Institutional Strength Increased With IBIT Reaching BlackRock’s Top 3 ETF product Meanwhile, the institutional adoption curve is already in acceleration mode, and a Bloomberg ETF analyst’s recent update has pushed the accelerator even harder. Eric Balchunas posted a data table that clearly highlighted the meteoric rise of BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF. He mentioned that it has now become the 3rd highest revenue-generating ETF out of BlackRock’s 1,197 funds. $IBIT is now the 3rd highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9b away from being #1.

He further added that this young ETF is only a few spots away from reaching the top spot in BlackRock’s top-performing ETF by revenue, despite competing with funds that have decades-long track records.

Also, referring to the recent Iran–Israel war and U.S. intervention that shook traditional markets earlier this June. She continued that Bitcoin didn’t act like it would end deep down the well. She pointed out that the Bitcoin price showed mesmerizing strength by holding key supports, even as equities plunged in June. CATHIE WOOD: “WE’RE STILL IN A BITCOIN BULL MARKET” ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood reaffirmed her bullish stance, stating the current cycle remains a Bitcoin bull market.

2025-07-04T12:45:08,"Bank of Russia governor insists buying Bitcoin is not on its agenda","The Bank of Russia is not considering investments in cryptocurrencies, its governor has indicated, despite Bitcoin reserves gaining popularity with monetary authorities around the world. Russia’s main financial regulator remains opposed to using decentralized digital money for payments, its head clarified, while leaving the door open to spending crypto in foreign trade. CBR not looking into buying BTC or other cryptocurrencies The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is wary of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), allowing only qualified investors and participants in cross-border exchange access to the digital coins that are yet to be properly regulated in the Russian Federation. As for acquiring crypto for its own reserves, the authority is not currently reviewing such possibility, according to a statement by its Chair, Elvira Nabiullina. Speaking at a briefing during the International Financial Congress in St. Petersburg, she stressed: “Considering our attitude towards them as risky and volatile assets, we certainly do not consider that we as the central bank may invest in that.” Quoted by RBC and TASS, Nabiullina also remarked that the CBR is still opposed to using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in Russia, where the ruble is the only legal tender by law, and maintains that only “ highly qualified investors ” and companies trading abroad can have them. She insisted: “We continue to be against using cryptocurrencies in payments inside the country. That is, ‘yes’ for foreign economic activity, ‘yes’ for particularly qualified investors as a target for investments. Nevertheless, we are against their use as a means of payment.” The Bank of Russia’s stance on keeping crypto in government coffers is backed by the country’s finance ministry. In March, Deputy Minister of Finance Vladimir Kolychev stated that the department did not intend to add volatile digital assets to the investment portfolio of the National Welfare Fund. The Minfin official emphasized that the fund’s holdings must be liquid and not subject to sudden changes in value. At the same time, he hinted that investing in less liquid and more profitable assets may become an option once the fund’s assets reach 7 to 10% of GDP. Russia lags behind neighbors in terms of crypto reserves Nabiullina’s latest statements on the matter come after the acting head of the CBR’s Financial Technologies Department, Stanislav Korop, previously noted that the central bank had not seriously discussed the creation of a national cryptocurrency reserve. The issue is not on the agenda, Korop said at the Digital Industry of Industrial Russia conference in early June, quoted by the business daily Kommersant and the RIA Novosti news agency. He emphasized that crypto assets come with significant risks of depreciation and stated: “Our attitude to cryptocurrencies, especially their high volatility, is well known.” The Russian central bank executive highlighted the United States’ example in that regard, commenting that the fact that its crypto reserve has been formed from confiscated assets significantly changes the perception of this instrument. “This is already a little different from a reserve that implies market attractiveness and fuels interest from the audience,” Stanislav Korop elaborated. U.S. President Donald Trump’s signing of an executive order to set up a strategic Bitcoin reserve this past March sparked a growing debate around the world on whether digital coins should be used as reserve assets. A number of nations are already making similar decisions, including some of the Russian Federation’s own neighbors in the post-Soviet space. Last month, a group of lawmakers in Kyiv filed a bill suggesting Ukraine should add cryptocurrencies to its foreign exchange reserves. Later in June, the National Bank of Kazakhstan supported a draft law submitted to the parliament in Astana featuring a proposal to create a state-run crypto reserve.

2025-07-04T12:40:42,"AI Bitcoin price prediction for July 31, 2025","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has seen a remarkable year so far, climbing from $93,425 on January 1 to $108,938 on July 4, a gain of over 16.6% in the first half of 2025. In particular, the rally has been bolstered by a number of high-profile developments, including a surge in institutional holdings. BlackRock, for instance, increased its Bitcoin exposure by more than $23 billion in H1 2025 alone, underscoring Wall Street’s deepening embrace of digital assets. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); One of the most notable blockchain events this year occurred just this week: a dormant Satoshi-era wallet containing 10,000 BTC moved for the first time in over 14 years. Valued at roughly $1.09 billion, the movement of such an old and massive holding has reignited conversations about the maturing life cycle of Bitcoin holders and the long-term redistribution of early wealth. Alongside that, BTC’s rise has helped mint more than 26,000 new Bitcoin millionaires , according to the latest findings from Finbold’s H1 2025 Cryptocurrency Market Report . !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Bitcoin price analysis Looking at the market structure, Bitcoin appears to be consolidating just below $109,000 after briefly testing highs around $109,600. The price currently trades at $108,906, with the intraday range showing a tightening pattern. On the 1-day chart, there’s evidence of firm support in the $108,300 to $108,400 zone, where multiple dips were absorbed by buyers. Meanwhile, resistance remains at the $109,600 mark, which capped previous attempts to break higher. Bitcoin 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView/Finbold Momentum indicators paint a picture of neutral sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has oscillated between 38 and 42 during the trading session, indicating that the market is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a period of healthy consolidation, with bulls and bears in balance ahead of the next catalyst. Beyond the charts, Bitcoin’s broader outlook is supported by a strong macro backdrop. The market capitalization stands at $2.16 trillion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45.75 billion and a fully diluted valuation which has risen to $2.28 trillion. Meanwhile, on-chain activity remains robust, with whale addresses steadily accumulating and long-term holder supply near all-time highs. AI Bitcoin price prediction for the end of July Based on current momentum, market structure, RSI behavior, and macro fundamentals, ChatGPT models forecast that Bitcoin could reach approximately $114,700 by July 31, 2025. This forecast assumes Bitcoin maintains support near $108,000 and breaks convincingly above the $109,600 resistance zone, which could trigger a new wave of algorithmic buying and FOMO-driven retail interest. The AI’s reasoning also factors in historical Q3 patterns, which often see increased fund allocations after end-of-quarter rebalancing, as well as the continued optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system. However, if the price fails to hold above $106,000 in the near term, this forecast could shift toward a more cautious outlook. For now, though, Bitcoin remains firmly in bullish territory, backed by favorable technicals, strong fundamentals, and growing institutional trust.
