2025-07-04T12:56:55,"Hyperliquid price outlook: Bulls need volume to break $40 ceiling","Hyperliquid faces repeated rejection at the $40 resistance zone. Despite its bullish structure, the lack of breakout volume suggests consolidation will persist until a decisive move confirms a new trend. Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) has exhibited strong bullish momentum in recent weeks, but current price action signals exhaustion as the token struggles to break through the $40 psychological resistance. This level has been tested multiple times without an impulsive breakout, suggesting that sellers remain firmly in control of this zone. While the broader trend remains intact, the recent lack of breakout volume and the inability to surpass this resistance increase the likelihood of continued range-bound price action in the near term. Key technical points $40 Resistance Zone: Strong psychological and structural resistance tapped multiple times without confirmation. $30 Swing Low Support: Liquidity zone that remains untested and could attract price for a sweep. $26 Key Level: Deeper support zone with potential for reversal if tapped on volume spike. HYPEUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Hyperliquid’s ongoing struggle at the $40 mark reveals underlying weakness in momentum. This resistance level has now served as a ceiling for several weeks, with each test resulting in either weak rejection candles or failed follow-through. In the absence of an impulsive breakout and volume confirmation, it is unlikely that bulls will regain short-term control. Technically, this heightens the probability of rejection and a return to lower support zones. The $30 swing low stands out as a key liquidity level that has yet to be tapped during recent rotations. A sweep of this level could act as a liquidity grab, a common occurrence before a reversal higher. If selling pressure persists, the $26 level comes into focus as a major structural support zone where a high-probability bounce setup could form.

Until a breakout occurs with strong volume, the token is likely to continue oscillating within the broader $26–$40 range. Volume remains the missing catalyst, and any legitimate breakout or breakdown will require a noticeable increase in either buying or selling pressure. What to expect in the coming price action Hyperliquid is likely to remain range-bound between $26 and $40 until volume validates a breakout. A sweep of the $30 level could prompt a short-term bounce, but genuine bullish continuation hinges on a convincing move above $40.

2025-07-04T12:56:09,"Bitcoin Climbs as Trump’s $5 Trillion Bill Sparks Market Volatility and Political Tensions: Your Weekly Crypto Market Update","Bitcoin had a relatively strong week, which helped it end the second quarter with almost 30% gains and trading around $109,000 by July 4th – pretty close to its all-time highs. The price briefly dipped to around $105K midweek following the Senate’s approval of Donald Trump’s massive budget legislation but it was quick to rebound. Analysts remain split on the short-term outlook: Standard Chartered maintains a positive view with a $200,000 year-end target, while BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes warns of a potentail dip to $90K before another rally. The major political development during this week was the passage of Trump’s $5 trillion legislation “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which makes the 2017 individual tax cuts permanent, lifts the debt ceiling, and rolls back programs such as Medicaid expansion and green energy incentives. After a narrow vote in the Senate on July 1st, the House approved the bill on July 3rd, following a lengthy Democratic nailbiter. Trump is expected to sign the bill on July 4th. The crypto market reacted with a temporary weakness. However, many see the bill’s inflationary impact, as well as the ballooning US debt as a long-term bullish sign for Bitcoin. Similar fiscal stimulus packages in the past (recall the 2020 COVID relief efforts) led to sharp crypto market rallies. Hence, some analysts believe that this could be a comparable setup. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized the bill’s cuts to clean energy and its impact on federal debt. He even went so far to suggest that he might create a third political party in response. Trump, of course, fired back, suggesting Musk could even face deportation, which escalated tensions between both of them. Other notable developments include the removal of a crypto tax relief amendment, which disappointed miners and stakers. However, the discussions around a US strategic Bitcoin reserve continue to gain moment. While Bitcoin is currently holding strong, regulatory uncertainty, macro shifts, and political risks remain some of the key variables for the coming weeks.

2025-07-04T12:50:55,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unwavering Optimism as Market Stays in Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unwavering Optimism as Market Stays in Greed Zone In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, understanding the collective mood of investors can be as crucial as analyzing price charts. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a widely recognized barometer of market sentiment, has consistently held its ground at 73 as of July 4. This sustained reading firmly places the market in the ‘Greed’ zone, indicating a prevailing sense of optimism and perhaps even euphoria among participants. But what does this unwavering optimism truly signify for the future of the crypto market? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does 73 Mean? Developed by software platform Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a vital tool for investors and analysts alike, providing a snapshot of the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Its scale ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ – a period of high anxiety and potential capitulation – and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed,’ often associated with market tops and irrational exuberance. A reading of 73, as observed, indicates a strong leaning towards ‘Greed.’ This suggests that investors are feeling confident, perhaps even overly optimistic, about future price movements. Historically, periods of extreme greed can precede market corrections, as assets may become overvalued due to speculative buying. Conversely, extreme fear often presents prime buying opportunities when assets are undervalued due to panic selling. The index is not just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key factors designed to capture the multifaceted nature of crypto market sentiment. These factors provide a comprehensive view, moving beyond mere price action to understand the underlying psychology driving investor behavior. Navigating Crypto Market Sentiment: Is Greed Good? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes a high ‘Greed’ score, it sparks a crucial question for many: Is this a positive sign of a healthy bull run, or a cautionary signal of an impending downturn? The answer, as often in financial markets, is nuanced. On one hand, sustained greed can indicate strong buying pressure and robust market momentum, pushing prices higher. This can be exhilarating for investors who are already in the market, seeing their portfolios grow. However, seasoned investors often recall the famous adage attributed to Warren Buffett: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” A high greed reading suggests that many market participants are already heavily invested, potentially with less room for new capital to flow in, and perhaps less caution being exercised. This can lead to speculative bubbles where assets trade above their intrinsic value, making them vulnerable to sharp corrections at the slightest negative news. Therefore, while the current sentiment points to strong bullish conviction, it also warrants a degree of prudence. It’s a time for investors to review their strategies, perhaps consider taking some profits, or at least ensure their risk management protocols are firmly in place. How Does Bitcoin Price Influence the Index? Bitcoin, as the pioneering and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often acts as the bellwether for the entire crypto market. Its price movements and dominance significantly sway the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. One of the six contributing factors to the index is Bitcoin dominance, which accounts for 10% of the overall score. This factor measures Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market cap. When Bitcoin’s price experiences a strong upward trend, it typically pulls the entire market with it, fostering a sense of optimism and pushing the index into the ‘Greed’ zone. Conversely, a significant drop in Bitcoin’s price can trigger widespread fear, dragging the index down. The stability of Bitcoin’s price, or a steady upward trajectory, often underpins the overall positive market analysis reflected in the index. It’s important to note that while Bitcoin is a major influence, the index considers other factors to provide a holistic view, ensuring it’s not solely reliant on one asset’s performance. Beyond the Numbers: Deep Dive into Market Analysis Factors The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a single number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of various market indicators, each contributing to the final score. Understanding these components offers a deeper insight into what truly shapes the prevailing sentiment: Volatility (25%): This factor measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, while stable or rising prices with controlled volatility can indicate greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component assesses the current volume and market momentum. High trading volumes and strong positive momentum typically indicate a greedy market, as more money flows in. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes cryptocurrency-related hashtags and mentions on various social media platforms, looking for the speed and quantity of posts, and sentiment analysis of those posts. A surge in positive, hyped mentions points to greed. Surveys (15%): Historically, this factor involved polling investors to gauge their sentiment. However, it’s currently paused, meaning its contribution to the overall score is temporarily excluded. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): As discussed, this measures Bitcoin’s market cap share. A rising dominance can sometimes signal fear (as investors flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin), while a falling dominance can indicate greed (as altcoins gain traction). In the context of the overall index, its interplay with other factors determines its final impact. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes Google search queries related to cryptocurrencies. A sudden surge in search terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto bubble’ suggests fear, while generic, high-volume searches might indicate growing public interest and potential greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index provides a robust and dynamic measure of market psychology, making it an invaluable resource for informed decision-making. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investing: When to Act? For those engaged in crypto investing, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers more than just an interesting statistic; it provides actionable insights. While it should never be the sole basis for investment decisions, it serves as an excellent complementary tool: Counter-Cyclical Investing: When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (low numbers), it might signal a good time to accumulate assets at potentially discounted prices, as panic selling often leads to undervaluation. Conversely, when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (high numbers, like the current 73), it could be a prudent time to consider taking profits or reducing exposure, as the market may be nearing a peak. Risk Management: A high greed score should prompt investors to re-evaluate their risk exposure. Are you over-leveraged? Is your portfolio too concentrated in highly speculative assets? This is a time to solidify stop-loss orders and perhaps diversify. Avoid FOMO: The ‘Greed’ zone often fuels Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). The index can serve as a reminder to resist impulsive buying at inflated prices, encouraging a more disciplined approach. Validate Other Signals: Use the index to validate other technical or fundamental analyses. If your charts show an overbought market and the index confirms high greed, it strengthens the case for caution. Ultimately, the index empowers investors to make more emotionally intelligent decisions, rather than being swept away by market euphoria or despair. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, steadfast at 73 and firmly rooted in the ‘Greed’ zone, continues to be a powerful indicator of the prevailing optimism in the crypto market. While this unwavering sentiment can fuel further growth, it also serves as a crucial reminder for investors to balance enthusiasm with prudence. By understanding the underlying factors that drive this index and integrating its insights into a broader market analysis strategy, participants can navigate the volatile crypto landscape with greater confidence and make more informed decisions about their crypto investing journey. Always remember, the market’s mood is just one piece of the puzzle; comprehensive research and risk management remain paramount.

2025-07-04T12:50:31,"Bitcoin Options: Urgent Warning as $3 Billion Expiration Looms","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Options: Urgent Warning as $3 Billion Expiration Looms Get ready for a significant event in the cryptocurrency world! On July 4, nearly $3 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire, a moment that often brings increased attention and potential shifts to the market. This isn’t just about Bitcoin; around $612 million in Ethereum options will also mature on the same day. For traders and enthusiasts alike, understanding these expiries is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of digital assets. Understanding the Massive Options Expiration Event Options contracts are a fascinating part of the derivatives market, giving traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. When a large volume of these contracts reaches their expiration date, it can create significant ripple effects across the market. The sheer scale of the upcoming options expiration on July 4th for both Bitcoin and Ethereum makes it a focal point for many. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key figures: Bitcoin (BTC) Options: Value: Approximately $3 billion Expiration Time: 08:00 UTC on July 4 Put/Call Ratio: 1.05 Max Pain Price: $106,000 Ethereum (ETH) Options: Value: Around $612 million Expiration Time: 08:00 UTC on July 4 Put/Call Ratio: 1.24 Max Pain Price: $2,500 The put/call ratio provides insight into market sentiment. A ratio above 1 indicates more put options (bets on price decline) than call options (bets on price increase), suggesting a more bearish sentiment among options traders for that particular asset. Bitcoin’s ratio of 1.05 and Ethereum’s 1.24 both lean slightly bearish, indicating a cautious stance from derivatives participants. What is the ‘ Max Pain Price ‘ and Why Does It Matter? The term ‘ max pain price ‘ might sound ominous, but it’s a critical concept in options trading. It refers to the price point at which the largest number of options traders would incur financial losses if the underlying asset settles at that value upon expiration. In simpler terms, it’s the strike price where the most open options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless, causing maximum financial suffering for the majority of options holders. For the upcoming expiration: Bitcoin’s max pain price is currently set at a staggering $106,000. Ethereum’s max pain price is $2,500. While the market doesn’t always gravitate towards the max pain price, it’s a closely watched metric because large options writers (those who sell options) might have an incentive to try and push the price towards this level to maximize their profits. This dynamic can sometimes contribute to increased crypto market volatility around expiration dates. How Might This Options Expiration Impact the Crypto Market Volatility ? Large options expiries can often be catalysts for increased crypto market volatility . Here’s why: Hedging Activities: Large institutional players and whales who have significant options positions might engage in hedging activities in the spot market as expiration approaches. For example, if they have sold a large number of call options, they might buy the underlying asset to cover their potential obligations, or vice versa for put options. This can lead to increased buying or selling pressure. Price Discovery: The resolution of open interest from options can lead to a period of price discovery. Once the uncertainty of expiration passes, the market might react to the new positioning of traders and the flow of capital. Sentiment Shift: If the market settles far from the max pain price, or if the put/call ratio shifts dramatically, it could signal a change in broader market sentiment, impacting future price movements. Liquidation Risks: In highly leveraged positions, sudden price movements around expiration could trigger liquidations, adding to market instability. It’s important to note that while options expiration can influence price action, it’s just one of many factors. Macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and broader market sentiment also play significant roles in determining the direction of Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Actionable Insights for Traders as July 4 Approaches Given the significant Bitcoin options and Ethereum options expiry, what should traders and investors consider? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Price Action Closely: Be prepared for potential heightened volatility around 08:00 UTC on July 4. Sudden spikes or dips are not uncommon as options positions are settled. Understand Your Risk: If you are involved in options trading, ensure you understand the implications of your positions expiring. For spot traders, be mindful of potential increased price swings and consider setting stop-loss orders. Watch Max Pain and Put/Call Ratios: While not a definitive predictor, monitoring the max pain price and put/call ratios can offer clues about the positioning of large options players and their potential influence on price. Look Beyond the Expiry: The immediate aftermath of an expiry can be just as important as the event itself. Markets often consolidate or find new direction once the derivatives overhang is cleared. Diversify and Research: As always, maintaining a diversified portfolio and conducting thorough research before making any trading decisions remains paramount. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially during periods of anticipated volatility. In Conclusion: Navigating the Derivatives Landscape The upcoming $3 billion Bitcoin options and $612 million Ethereum options expiration on July 4 is a noteworthy event that highlights the growing maturity and complexity of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. While the ‘max pain price’ and put/call ratios offer intriguing insights into trader positioning, the actual market reaction will depend on a confluence of factors. Understanding these dynamics, especially the potential for increased crypto market volatility , empowers participants to make more informed decisions. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a long-term holder, staying informed about such significant derivatives events is key to navigating the ever-evolving world of digital assets. The crypto market continues to evolve, and with it, the tools and strategies required to succeed.

Here Are the Details","There has been a rare flurry of activity on the Bitcoin blockchain. According to on-chain data, two Bitcoin wallets that have been dormant for 14 years have transferred a total of 20,000 BTC (about $2.18 billion) to other addresses. Bitcoin Wallets Recover After 14 Years: 20,000 BTC Moved These addresses first appeared on April 3, 2011, in a transaction made by a wallet named “1HqXB…gDwcK.” In the transaction in question, 23,377.83 BTC were sent to three different addresses. Two addresses received 10,000 BTC, while the third address was left with 3,377.83 BTC. These two large recipient wallets (“12tLs…xj2me” and “1KbrS…AWJYm”) have not made any transactions since then. However, this changed on Thursday night and early Friday morning. Both addresses moved their 10,000 BTC balances to new addresses within 30 minutes of each other. Interestingly, the BTCs sent to these addresses were recorded as the first and only incoming transactions for these wallets. The new addresses that were sent to have not shown any activity for now. It remains unknown whether these two wallets belong to the same person or different people. There is also no information about the reason for the transfers. However, the striking point is this: These 20,000 BTC, which were worth $ 7,800 in 2011, are now worth approximately $ 2.18 billion, indicating a tremendous increase in value of 13,982,800%.

2025-07-04T12:45:08,"Bank of Russia governor insists buying Bitcoin is not on its agenda","The Bank of Russia is not considering investments in cryptocurrencies, its governor has indicated, despite Bitcoin reserves gaining popularity with monetary authorities around the world. Russia’s main financial regulator remains opposed to using decentralized digital money for payments, its head clarified, while leaving the door open to spending crypto in foreign trade. CBR not looking into buying BTC or other cryptocurrencies The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is wary of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), allowing only qualified investors and participants in cross-border exchange access to the digital coins that are yet to be properly regulated in the Russian Federation. As for acquiring crypto for its own reserves, the authority is not currently reviewing such possibility, according to a statement by its Chair, Elvira Nabiullina. Speaking at a briefing during the International Financial Congress in St. Petersburg, she stressed: “Considering our attitude towards them as risky and volatile assets, we certainly do not consider that we as the central bank may invest in that.” Quoted by RBC and TASS, Nabiullina also remarked that the CBR is still opposed to using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in Russia, where the ruble is the only legal tender by law, and maintains that only “ highly qualified investors ” and companies trading abroad can have them. She insisted: “We continue to be against using cryptocurrencies in payments inside the country. That is, ‘yes’ for foreign economic activity, ‘yes’ for particularly qualified investors as a target for investments. Nevertheless, we are against their use as a means of payment.” The Bank of Russia’s stance on keeping crypto in government coffers is backed by the country’s finance ministry. In March, Deputy Minister of Finance Vladimir Kolychev stated that the department did not intend to add volatile digital assets to the investment portfolio of the National Welfare Fund. The Minfin official emphasized that the fund’s holdings must be liquid and not subject to sudden changes in value. At the same time, he hinted that investing in less liquid and more profitable assets may become an option once the fund’s assets reach 7 to 10% of GDP. Russia lags behind neighbors in terms of crypto reserves Nabiullina’s latest statements on the matter come after the acting head of the CBR’s Financial Technologies Department, Stanislav Korop, previously noted that the central bank had not seriously discussed the creation of a national cryptocurrency reserve. The issue is not on the agenda, Korop said at the Digital Industry of Industrial Russia conference in early June, quoted by the business daily Kommersant and the RIA Novosti news agency. He emphasized that crypto assets come with significant risks of depreciation and stated: “Our attitude to cryptocurrencies, especially their high volatility, is well known.” The Russian central bank executive highlighted the United States’ example in that regard, commenting that the fact that its crypto reserve has been formed from confiscated assets significantly changes the perception of this instrument. “This is already a little different from a reserve that implies market attractiveness and fuels interest from the audience,” Stanislav Korop elaborated. U.S. President Donald Trump’s signing of an executive order to set up a strategic Bitcoin reserve this past March sparked a growing debate around the world on whether digital coins should be used as reserve assets. A number of nations are already making similar decisions, including some of the Russian Federation’s own neighbors in the post-Soviet space. Last month, a group of lawmakers in Kyiv filed a bill suggesting Ukraine should add cryptocurrencies to its foreign exchange reserves.

2025-07-04T12:40:42,"AI Bitcoin price prediction for July 31, 2025","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has seen a remarkable year so far, climbing from $93,425 on January 1 to $108,938 on July 4, a gain of over 16.6% in the first half of 2025. In particular, the rally has been bolstered by a number of high-profile developments, including a surge in institutional holdings. BlackRock, for instance, increased its Bitcoin exposure by more than $23 billion in H1 2025 alone, underscoring Wall Street’s deepening embrace of digital assets. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); One of the most notable blockchain events this year occurred just this week: a dormant Satoshi-era wallet containing 10,000 BTC moved for the first time in over 14 years. Valued at roughly $1.09 billion, the movement of such an old and massive holding has reignited conversations about the maturing life cycle of Bitcoin holders and the long-term redistribution of early wealth. Alongside that, BTC’s rise has helped mint more than 26,000 new Bitcoin millionaires , according to the latest findings from Finbold’s H1 2025 Cryptocurrency Market Report . !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Bitcoin price analysis Looking at the market structure, Bitcoin appears to be consolidating just below $109,000 after briefly testing highs around $109,600. The price currently trades at $108,906, with the intraday range showing a tightening pattern. On the 1-day chart, there’s evidence of firm support in the $108,300 to $108,400 zone, where multiple dips were absorbed by buyers. Meanwhile, resistance remains at the $109,600 mark, which capped previous attempts to break higher. Bitcoin 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView/Finbold Momentum indicators paint a picture of neutral sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has oscillated between 38 and 42 during the trading session, indicating that the market is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a period of healthy consolidation, with bulls and bears in balance ahead of the next catalyst. Beyond the charts, Bitcoin’s broader outlook is supported by a strong macro backdrop. The market capitalization stands at $2.16 trillion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45.75 billion and a fully diluted valuation which has risen to $2.28 trillion. Meanwhile, on-chain activity remains robust, with whale addresses steadily accumulating and long-term holder supply near all-time highs. AI Bitcoin price prediction for the end of July Based on current momentum, market structure, RSI behavior, and macro fundamentals, ChatGPT models forecast that Bitcoin could reach approximately $114,700 by July 31, 2025. This forecast assumes Bitcoin maintains support near $108,000 and breaks convincingly above the $109,600 resistance zone, which could trigger a new wave of algorithmic buying and FOMO-driven retail interest. The AI’s reasoning also factors in historical Q3 patterns, which often see increased fund allocations after end-of-quarter rebalancing, as well as the continued optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system. However, if the price fails to hold above $106,000 in the near term, this forecast could shift toward a more cautious outlook. For now, though, Bitcoin remains firmly in bullish territory, backed by favorable technicals, strong fundamentals, and growing institutional trust.

2025-07-04T12:40:13,"Bitmax’s Astounding Bitcoin Surge: A Bold Crypto Treasury Strategy Unveiled","BitcoinWorld Bitmax’s Astounding Bitcoin Surge: A Bold Crypto Treasury Strategy Unveiled In a move that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency world, South Korea-based metaverse platform Bitmax has announced a dramatic increase in its Bitcoin holdings . Since the start of the year, the company’s BTC reserves have surged nearly sevenfold, now standing at approximately 349.19 BTC, according to recent reports from Newsis. This impressive accumulation signals a strategic shift and a deeper commitment to digital assets, positioning Bitmax as a significant player in the corporate crypto space. Why Are Companies Like Bitmax Expanding Their Bitcoin Holdings? The decision by Bitmax to significantly ramp up its Bitcoin reserves is part of a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. For many, Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset but a legitimate component of a diversified asset management strategy. Here’s why companies are increasingly turning to BTC: Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Digital Gold Narrative: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares characteristics with traditional safe-haven assets, offering a store of value in the digital age. Balance Sheet Optimization: Holding Bitcoin can potentially enhance a company’s balance sheet, offering upside potential beyond traditional investments. Strategic Alignment: For Web3 companies like Bitmax, holding crypto assets aligns perfectly with their core business model and vision for a decentralized future. Bitmax’s strategic move underscores a broader institutional embrace of Bitcoin, following in the footsteps of pioneers like MicroStrategy and Tesla, who have famously integrated BTC into their corporate treasuries. Who is Bitmax and What’s Their Vision for a Metaverse Platform? Bitmax is not just another company accumulating Bitcoin; it’s a prominent metaverse platform based in South Korea, deeply entrenched in the evolving Web3 ecosystem. Their core business revolves around creating immersive digital worlds and experiences, pushing the boundaries of virtual interaction and digital ownership. The company’s vision extends beyond mere entertainment, aiming to build robust economic frameworks within their metaverse environments. This strategic accumulation of Bitcoin is not an isolated event but a carefully calculated part of Bitmax’s broader mid- to long-term asset management strategy. It reflects a belief in the enduring value of decentralized assets and their role in the future of digital economies. Furthermore, Bitmax’s commitment extends to supporting its affiliate, DeepMind Platform, in its stablecoin initiatives. This synergy highlights a comprehensive approach to integrating various facets of the crypto economy, from volatile assets like Bitcoin to stable assets designed for transactional stability within their digital ecosystems. The Ingenious Strategy: Leveraging Convertible Bonds for Crypto Acquisition One of the most intriguing aspects of Bitmax’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy is its method: the issuance of convertible bonds . This financial instrument offers a unique way for companies to raise capital while providing flexibility in their long-term financial structure. But how does it work, and why is it particularly suited for acquiring volatile assets like Bitcoin? A convertible bond is a type of bond that the holder can convert into a specified number of common shares of the issuing company or, in this case, potentially other assets, under certain conditions. For Bitmax, this method likely provides several advantages: Cost-Effective Capital: Convertible bonds often come with lower interest rates than traditional bonds because of the embedded option to convert into equity or other assets. Reduced Dilution (Initially): Unlike direct equity issuance, convertible bonds don’t immediately dilute existing shareholders. Dilution only occurs if the bonds are converted. Flexible Financing: It allows Bitmax to secure capital for its Bitcoin purchases without immediately impacting its equity structure, offering a bridge between debt and equity financing. Market Signal: Issuing convertible bonds specifically for BTC acquisition sends a strong signal to investors about the company’s long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. This innovative use of traditional financial instruments to fuel a digital asset strategy showcases Bitmax’s sophisticated approach to corporate finance in the Web3 era. Building a Robust Crypto Treasury: Benefits and Future Implications The concept of a crypto treasury , where companies hold significant amounts of cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets, is rapidly gaining traction. For Bitmax, establishing a substantial Bitcoin treasury offers a multitude of potential benefits, alongside some inherent challenges: Benefits of a Corporate Crypto Treasury: Benefit Description Potential Appreciation Exposure to Bitcoin’s potential long-term value growth, acting as a significant asset on the balance sheet. Diversification Adds a non-correlated asset class to traditional financial holdings, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Innovation & Brand Identity Positions the company as a leader in digital innovation, attracting talent and customers aligned with the crypto ethos. Operational Efficiency Facilitates future crypto-native operations, payments, and ecosystem development. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can significantly impact balance sheet valuations, requiring robust risk management. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings necessitates careful navigation. Accounting Complexity: Specific accounting treatments for digital assets can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks or loss. Despite these challenges, Bitmax’s continued commitment to building its BTC treasury suggests a strong belief in the net positive impact for its long-term strategic goals. The Synergy: Bitcoin, Stablecoins, and the Metaverse Platform Ecosystem Bitmax’s strategy isn’t just about accumulating Bitcoin; it’s about fostering a comprehensive digital asset ecosystem within its metaverse platform . The company’s intention to continue building its BTC treasury while simultaneously supporting DeepMind Platform’s stablecoin initiatives reveals a holistic vision for Web3 integration. Imagine a metaverse where users can seamlessly transact, earn, and own digital assets. Bitcoin, with its global liquidity and store-of-value properties, could serve as a foundational reserve asset, providing stability and credibility to the broader ecosystem. Stablecoins, on the other hand, are crucial for day-to-day transactions within the metaverse, offering price stability essential for commerce, gaming, and other interactive experiences without the volatility of assets like BTC. This dual approach — leveraging Bitcoin for strategic long-term value and stablecoins for operational utility — creates a robust economic backbone for Bitmax’s metaverse. It positions them not just as a consumer of crypto, but as an active participant in shaping the future of digital economies, where decentralized finance (DeFi) and immersive virtual worlds converge. A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Finance Bitmax’s aggressive expansion of its Bitcoin holdings through innovative financing mechanisms like convertible bonds is more than just a corporate announcement; it’s a powerful indicator of where corporate finance is heading. As the lines between traditional finance and decentralized digital assets blur, companies that strategically embrace cryptocurrencies are likely to gain a competitive edge. This move by a prominent metaverse platform underscores the increasing convergence of cutting-edge technology and sophisticated financial strategies, paving the way for a new era of corporate asset management.

Bitcoin News Today: Trump’s Spending Bill Could Spark BTC Rally Bitcoin investors are watching closely as U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign a massive government spending bill—the “ One Big Beautiful Bill ”—on July 4. The bill is being hailed as one of the most comprehensive economic packages of Trump’s second term. With key provisions for tax cuts, defense spending, and debt ceiling hikes, experts say it could fuel inflation fears—and historically, that’s bullish for Bitcoin.

For those invested in the dynamic cryptocurrency space, understanding disruptive technologies like AI is crucial, as they often intersect and influence market trends. Today, we delve into the remarkable story of Cluely , a startup that has recently captured Silicon Valley’s attention with its meteoric rise in annual recurring revenue (ARR). In just one week, Cluely ‘s ARR reportedly doubled to an astonishing $7 million, a testament to the surging demand for its innovative AI-powered tools. This rapid ascent, however, comes with its own set of challenges, as competitors quickly emerge in this fast-evolving landscape. How Did Cluely Achieve Such Rapid Growth? Cluely , a name now synonymous with rapid innovation, launched its new enterprise product and immediately saw its revenue skyrocket. Founder Roy Lee reported to Bitcoin World that “Every single person who has a meeting or an interview is testing this out.” What exactly does Cluely offer that has garnered such widespread interest? AI-Powered Analysis: The core of Cluely ‘s offering is its ability to use AI to analyze online conversations in real-time. Real-Time Notes & Context: Users receive instant notes, context, and suggested questions discreetly on their screen, invisible to others in the conversation. Strategic Evolution: Initially born from controversy—Lee’s viral X thread about a tool to “cheat on job interviews”—the startup embraced a more refined marketing tagline: “Everything you Need. Before you ask. … This feels like cheating.” This clever positioning, combined with its unique utility, propelled its early traction. Significant Backing: The startup is now backed by prominent venture capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz , Abstract Ventures, and Susa Ventures, lending it credibility and resources for expansion. Before this enterprise product launch, Lee had already boasted that the company’s ARR exceeded $3 million and that it was profitable, indicating a strong foundation for its recent exponential growth. The Power of Real-Time AI Notetaker Technology The most compelling feature driving Cluely ‘s adoption, according to Roy Lee, is its real-time AI notetaker capability. While many AI tools offer post-call summaries, Cluely distinguishes itself by providing insights as the conversation unfolds. “Meeting notes have been a proven very sticky, very interesting AI use case. The only problem with them is they’re all post-call,” Lee explained. “You want to look back at them in the middle of a meeting, and that is what we offer.” This real-time functionality addresses a critical pain point for professionals across various sectors. Business use cases extend beyond just interviews, encompassing: Sales Calls: Providing sales representatives with instant context and talking points. Customer Support: Equipping support agents with immediate answers and relevant information. Remote Tutoring: Aiding educators in delivering personalized and informed instruction. The enterprise version of Cluely includes additional features like team management and enhanced security settings, making it suitable for larger organizations. Lee even mentioned signing a public company that recently doubled its annual contract with Cluely to $2.5 million, underscoring the strong business interest despite the startup’s unconventional origins. A New Era for Startups : Innovation Meets Disruption Cluely ‘s journey is a prime example of how modern startups are leveraging cutting-edge technology, particularly AI, to disrupt established markets. Its ability to quickly identify a market need—real-time conversational intelligence—and build a product that delivers immediate value highlights a key trend in the current tech ecosystem. The rapid growth seen by Cluely illustrates the immense potential for new ventures that can effectively harness AI to solve practical problems. However, the world of startups is also characterized by intense competition and the constant threat of replication. As innovative solutions gain traction, others are quick to follow, sometimes with open-source alternatives that challenge the proprietary model. This dynamic environment demands agility and continuous innovation from companies like Cluely to maintain their competitive edge. What Does Andreessen Horowitz ‘s Backing Mean for Cluely? The involvement of top-tier venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is a significant endorsement for any startup. For Cluely , this backing provides more than just capital; it offers strategic guidance, networking opportunities, and a strong signal of legitimacy to potential clients and future investors. Andreessen Horowitz is known for investing in companies that they believe will define the next generation of technology, and their investment in Cluely suggests a strong belief in the startup’s long-term vision and market potential. This support can be crucial for scaling operations, attracting top talent, and navigating the complex competitive landscape. Is the Future of AI Tools Open Source? While Cluely enjoys its moment in the spotlight, the competitive landscape for AI tools is rapidly evolving. A significant challenge emerged recently from Pickle, a company describing itself as a “digital clone factory.” Pickle announced “Glass,” an open-source, free product with functionality strikingly similar to Cluely ‘s real-time notetaker. The immediate reception to Glass was notable: Over 850 stars on its repository by mid-day, indicating strong community interest. Nearly 150 forks, showing active developer engagement in trying and adapting the free version. This development raises a crucial question for the future of AI startups: Can proprietary, venture-backed companies like Cluely withstand the pressure from free, open-source alternatives that offer comparable core features? The open-source community’s ability to quickly replicate and distribute tools could democratize access to advanced AI functionalities, forcing companies like Cluely to innovate beyond core features and focus on superior user experience, robust enterprise-grade security, and comprehensive support to justify their price point. Navigating the Competitive Waters Cluely ‘s impressive growth trajectory highlights the immense potential of AI in transforming how we interact and work. However, its journey also serves as a case study for the challenges facing high-growth startups in the AI space. The immediate emergence of open-source rivals like Glass underscores the need for continuous innovation and strategic differentiation. Cluely ‘s strength lies in its proven ability to attract paying customers, including a major public company. Its enterprise features, team management capabilities, and enhanced security settings could be key differentiators against free offerings. Ultimately, the market will decide if the convenience and advanced features of a paid service outweigh the cost-effectiveness of a free, open-source solution. A Look Ahead The story of Cluely is a compelling narrative of innovation, rapid market adoption, and the inevitable challenges of competition in the fast-paced AI sector. Its success, fueled by strong demand for its real-time AI notetaker and significant backing from firms like Andreessen Horowitz , positions it as a major player. Yet, the rise of open-source alternatives like Glass reminds us that the future of AI tools is dynamic and ever-evolving. Time will reveal if Cluely can maintain its astonishing momentum and solidify its market leadership amidst a landscape where disruptive innovation is met with equally rapid replication.

2025-07-04T12:30:05,"Bitcoin Holds Strong, But a New Wave of Meme Coins Can Deliver the Real Action This Summer","Bitcoin remains steady and reliable, but the real excitement this summer could come from meme coins. These quirky and bold digital currencies are catching attention and have potential for rapid growth. Enthusiasts and investors are keeping a close eye on emerging meme coins that might just steal the spotlight. Discover which ones are ready to skyrocket. SPX6900 Price Action Analysis: Gains and Volatility in Recent Weeks SPX6900 experienced a 6.77% gain over the past month but faced an 18.14% drop over the past week, showing volatility in its short-term behavior. The last six months revealed an overall decline of 8.39%, indicating that while recent recovery attempts are visible, longer-term trends remain under pressure. The price fluctuated between $0.83 and $1.65, suggesting attempts to recover despite vulnerabilities that have hindered a sustained breakout. The month’s improvement contrasts with the broader half-year performance, reflecting the changing investor sentiment and market dynamics affecting SPX6900. The current price of SPX6900 is between $0.83 and $1.65, with support around $0.46 and nearest resistance at $2.11, while a secondary resistance appears near $2.94. The market shows indecision, with the Awesome Oscillator slightly negative at -0.038 and RSI near 45, indicating a neutral outlook with modest positive momentum. Bulls and bears are nearly even, lacking a strong trend. Trading ideas suggest monitoring moves near the upper range; a break above $2.11 may signal bullish momentum, while a drop below $0.83 could lead toward further support at $0.46. Shiba Inu Price Review: Past Trends and Current Key Levels Shiba Inu experienced a steady decline over the last month and six-month period. The coin dropped about 3.93% in one week, deepening to a 13.13% loss over the past month and suffering a steep 50.85% fall in six months. This sustained decrease reflects growing bearish sentiment and market uncertainty, with persistent sell pressure shaping its recent performance. Price volatility has shaken investor confidence and reinforced caution among holders as the coin struggles to regain lost ground. Current prices trade between $0.00000977 and $0.00001334, placing the coin in a tight range with the nearest resistance at $0.00001527 and support at $0.00000813. Bears remain in control as the price has not been able to rally decisively. Technical indicators such as an RSI of 41.45 confirm a predominantly bearish outlook. No clear trend has emerged, prompting traders to watch key levels for possible reversals. Ideas include shorting near resistance if selling pressure resumes or exploring long positions on a confirmed bounce from support. Pepe Valuation Dip and Trading Zones: A Price Analysis Pepe experienced a significant decline in valuation, with a drop of about 21% over the last month and a staggering decrease of approximately 54% in the past six months. Volatility has increased, indicating a bearish sentiment prevailing in the market. Recent trading behavior suggests that sellers have been more active, influencing the downtrend and driving prices lower. Pepe currently trades within a range of $0.00000750 and $0.00001280, facing resistance at $0.00001585 and support at $0.00000525. The market reflects mixed signals, with a Relative Strength Index at 41.65 and a negative Awesome Oscillator indicating bearish pressure. Bears dominate as trading recommendations point to caution. Short-term traders might find opportunities in quick trades between these levels, while those considering longer positions should remain wary of potential risks associated with recent price declines. Conclusion Bitcoin remains steady and reliable. Meanwhile, new meme coins bring fresh excitement. SPX , SHIB , and PEPE could spark significant interest and activity. These coins have the potential to draw attention and trading volume. Their growth may define the summer for crypto enthusiasts looking for dynamic changes.

In his latest YouTube video, crypto analyst Lark Davis explains how upcoming spot ETFs for major altcoins like XRP, Solana, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Cardano, Sui, and Aptos could trigger a massive market surge. With the SEC showing signs of softening toward altcoin ETFs, Davis believes a major shift is already underway. Wall Street Wants More Than Bitcoin and ETH Lark Davis highlights four leading altcoin ETF contenders: XRP, Solana, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. XRP has seven ETF filings and is now legally cleared after Ripple dropped its cross-appeal against the SEC . Bloomberg’s James Seyffart expects $85 million in week-one inflows, while JP Morgan projects $8 billion in the first year. Analyst Zack Rector even suggests XRP could hit $30 , up from $2, if targets are met. Solana has nine ETF applications, and the live RexShares-Osprey staking ETF signals growing demand. With potential 8%+ staking yields, JP Morgan predicts $3–$6 billion in inflows, with approval likely this month. Litecoin has three filings and could attract $290–$580 million, based on its market cap. Davis calls it a quiet but solid candidate. Dogecoin may follow soon. Bitwise is updating its application to allow in-kind redemptions, enabling swaps for real DOGE. Even capturing 10% of Bitcoin ETF inflows could bring in $4 billion. [post_titles_links postid=”478551″] Round Two: Cardano, Avalanche, Sui, Aptos Davis adds that Cardano, Avalanche, and HBAR could be next in line, with ETF conversions already underway via Grayscale’s Large Cap Trust. JP Morgan estimates $14 billion in altcoin ETF inflows in the first year likely a conservative figure as momentum builds. According to Davis, Wall Street is already positioning itself. Altcoins offer higher upside and lower liquidity, making them prime targets. With ETF access opening up, institutional capital is ready to pour in, and most retail investors, he warns, are still unaware.

Here is the Latest Data","On July 3, investor interest in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) traded in the US increased again. $751 Million Net Inflows into Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on July 3 Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $602 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC fund received the most inflows with $237 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw strong performance, with daily net inflows totaling $149 million. All funds saw positive flows, with Grayscale’s ETHE fund alone seeing net outflows of $5.35 million. This data shows that investor interest is rapidly recovering following the $342 million outflow in spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 2. Experts say that despite short-term fluctuations, there is still strong institutional demand for ETFs, which could put upward pressure on crypto assets. The intense interest in crypto ETFs is considered an important indicator at a time when the market is searching for new catalysts. As inflows into ETFs continue, the Bitcoin price was trading at $108,800 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

Analyst Explains!","Bitcoin fell below $100,000 in June due to the tensions in the Middle East. However, following the positive news, it rose to $109,000. After a highly volatile June, investors turned to July for bullish sentiment. At this point, one analyst said that options traders are betting on a major July bullish trend in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sean Dawson, head of research at derivatives exchange Derive.xyz, said that implied volatility for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) decreased in June, leading investors to expect a sharp rally in July, The Block reported. “Bitcoin and Ethereum also experienced major declines on June 13 and 22, when tensions in the Middle East escalated. But temporary volatility spikes showed us that markets were betting on a limited decline. And that's exactly what happened. The decline was temporary and BTC, ETH recovered.” At this point, Dawson said that the decrease in volatility and the limited decline in June motivated option investors to move upwards. Dawson stated that Drive.xyz options data presents a relatively more balanced outlook for Bitcoin but shows stronger bullish momentum for Ethereum. According to the data, approximately 80% of July call options for Ethereum are above $3,000. “Traders are betting on a big July with subdued volatility and bullish position splits All eyes are now on the Fed, macro data and further geopolitical developments. ETH has a stronger momentum narrative, but BTC's options market is at a turning point. “Because nearly half of all open interest expiring on July 25 is in calls at $130,000 to $135,000, and the other half is in puts at $85,000 to $90,000.

In crypto, doubt spreads fast especially when it targets big names like Binance. One tweet is all it takes to stir up fear, fuel speculation, and send social media into overdrive. But this time, the response came just as fast and straight from the top. Here’s what the twitter buzz is all about. Wynn Claims Binance Is Hiding Its Reserves Over the weekend, Hyperliquid trader James Wynn accused Binance of skipping its monthly proof-of-reserves (PoR) update – something the exchange typically publishes at the start of each month. His since-deleted post read: “BINANCE HAS STILL YET TO POST PROOF OF RESERVES Binance has notoriously posted their proof of reserves on the 1st of every month!!” The message sparked concerns around transparency but Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was quick to respond. CZ Slams FUD CZ shut down the claim with a short reply on X: Bruh… FUD. 4. Binance usually takes a few days to publish. Usually on 5th or 6th. The snapshot is taken on the first. Check the history properly please. Thank you for your attention to Binance. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) July 4, 2025 According to him, Binance takes a snapshot of reserves on the 1st of each month, but the actual report is released a few days later after verification. This has been the standard process for months. While some users appreciated the clarification, others felt CZ was giving too much attention to a post that didn’t deserve it. June PoR Confirms Strong Backing Binance’s June proof-of-reserves report is already out and it confirms that all user assets remain backed 1:1. The data also shows a massive increase in BTC holdings, with Binance’s non-customer Bitcoin balance jumping from 2,746 BTC in February to 606,080 BTC in June. ETH and SOL balances remain low, indicating a stronger Bitcoin position. Who Is James Wynn? Wynn has become known for risky Hyperliquid trades and some very public losses, including a $100 million missed profit. He’s also been asking for donations to keep trading and previously promoted a token linked to Andrew Tate, which is now down 97% from its peak. Now, he appears to be making a shift toward loud commentary but it backfired this time. He even replied to CZ’s clarification. Good to know! Thank you for so kindly informing those that was wondering / unaware… — Wynn, James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) July 4, 2025 CZ Is Still a Key Voice in Crypto Though no longer CEO, CZ continues to play a leading role in defending Binance’s reputation. From addressing misinformation to backing strategic moves like Nano Labs’ BNB-only reserves, he hasn’t stepped out of the spotlight.

2025-07-04T12:00:04,"The $1 Dogecoin Dream Is Alive: Chartist Lays Out Parabolic Scenario","The improbable $1 price target for Dogecoin has returned to the spotlight after independent crypto analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) shared a bold new Ichimoku-based projection on July 3. In a chart posted to X, the analyst outlined a parabolic price trajectory for DOGE using 2-week candles, suggesting that the memecoin could begin an explosive ascent in late 2025, eventually reaching the symbolic one-dollar mark. The $1 Dogecoin Dream The projection rests on DOGE’s ability to maintain current bullish structure above the Ichimoku cloud, with a brief retest later this year during liftoff. “DOGE 2-week candles, Ichimoku cloud shown. Why am I buying doge? Because I’m delusional and this is what I’m thinking,” the trader wrote, pairing tongue-in-cheek self-awareness with conviction in a longer-term breakout scenario. At the time of the chart’s publication, Dogecoin was trading at $0.172, up nearly 14% on the fortnight. The price action shows a clean bounce off the top of the green Ichimoku cloud, suggesting that DOGE is holding bullish structure on a high timeframe, a key technical criterion in Ichimoku trend-following theory. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Quiet Setup Could Detonate Shorty, Says Analyst—Here’s The Target The Ichimoku Cloud (Kumo) on the 2-week timeframe, calculated with the traditional 9/26/52/26 settings, shows the Leading Span A (Senkou A) currently above Leading Span B (Senkou B), forming a green cloud—indicative of a bullish trend outlook. DOGE’s price is above the cloud, which acts as dynamic support. This is critical: Ichimoku practitioners consider price above the cloud to be in a bullish regime, especially on higher timeframes. The analyst’s hand-drawn black curve on the chart begins near $0.17 and initially curves downward, touching the upper boundary of the Kumo in the near future, likely near the $0.15–0.16 zone. This suggests an expected retest of the cloud support, a common setup in trend continuation trades. Rather than projecting a breakdown, the curve depicts this contact as a springboard for a rapid vertical rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under $0.20 ‘Is Free,’ Says Analyst—Predicts 2,000% Upside Once the price completes its cloud retest, the trajectory steepens dramatically, punching through overhead resistance near $0.29—the approximate flat Kijun-sen level—then continuing past prior 2024 highs. The final stretch of the curve accelerates toward the $1 level sometime in 2026, consistent with the behavior seen in prior memecoin mania phases. Interestingly, Cantonese Cat’s conviction comes despite several bearish near-term signals. Just two days prior to publishing the chart, the analyst wrote: “DOGE closed the month below the 20-month SMA, with a bearish engulfing candle! I would care if the volume wasn’t so pathetic…” That statement acknowledged structural weakness but dismissed it on the basis of low participation, hinting that sellers lacked conviction. The same day, the trader disclosed renewed entries into DOGE and Avalanche, stating, “I don’t know if I’m doing it right, but I bought AVAX and DOGE again this morning.” Broader Context DOGE’s memetic status makes it particularly susceptible to sentiment shifts, and it remains uncorrelated to fundamentals in the traditional sense. Still, in the 2021 and 2024 bull markets, DOGE served as a proxy for retail risk appetite, often outperforming once attention rotated from majors like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The green cloud forecast and the rising trajectory into 2026 may reflect not just technical setups, but a broader cyclical expectation: that another wave of liquidity, speculative mania, or cultural relevance could return DOGE to the spotlight. For now, however, the price must hold the cloud before the market can validate this roadmap. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1678.

2025-07-04T11:55:59,"Bitcoin Eyes 40% Gains as Trump’s Spending Bill Advances","Bitcoin could see a major price rally as traders anticipate a potential 40% surge if President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” is signed on Independence Day. The bill, which includes substantial new spending measures, is expected to add to the already rising U.S. debt levels, a scenario that historically aligns with Bitcoin price increases. Analysts note that markets tend to respond positively when U.S. borrowing increases, viewing it as a sign of added liquidity. According to estimates from prediction platform Kalshi, the U.S. national debt could reach $40 trillion in 2025 if the bill is enacted, up from $23.2 trillion at the start of 2020. “This would mark a nearly $17 trillion increase in six years, levels of borrowing never seen before in the country’s history,” noted The Kobeissi Letter in a recent analysis. While such borrowing raises concerns about fiscal sustainability, it has often created favorable conditions for Bitcoin as investors hedge against potential currency debasement. Historical Trends Support Bullish Outlook Crypto market watchers point to past instances where significant U.S. spending bills coincided with Bitcoin price surges. In late 2020, following Trump’s signing of a COVID-19 relief bill, Bitcoin rallied by 38% within weeks. If similar market behavior follows the signing of the “Big Beautiful Bill,” Bitcoin could surpass the $150,000 mark, building on its previous cycles of gains amid expanding debt levels. Additionally, the rising global M2 money supply continues to provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin. M2, a broad measure of the money supply, has shown a clear correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements, often leading to upward price trends with a slight delay. On Thursday, global M2 reached a record high of over $55.4 trillion, signaling continued liquidity expansion that could further fuel Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Market Participants Remain Watchful Trader and analyst Rekt Capital noted that M2 can continue rising even after Bitcoin experiences a bull market top, suggesting the current liquidity environment may support extended bullish conditions for BTC. As Independence Day approaches, market participants remain attentive to any developments regarding the bill’s passage. With fiscal policies and liquidity trends aligned in Bitcoin’s favor, traders and institutional investors are positioning for potential upside in the coming weeks. For now, Bitcoin’s price trajectory will likely depend on both macroeconomic developments and signals from the U.S. government’s fiscal stance. Many see this as a defining moment for crypto markets in 2025.

CoinDesk Research indicates that one reason bitcoin has ye to reach new all-time highs has been selling pressure from these long-term holders. However, zooming out, Glassnode data shows that the percentage of bitcoin’s circulating supply that has not moved in at least three years currently stands at 45%, which is the same level observed in February 2024, one month after the launch of the US exchange-traded fund. Three years ago, in July 2022, the market was in the midst of the leverage crisis triggered by the collapse of 3AC and Celsius during the last bear market, when bitcoin was priced at $20,000, which shows the conviction of LTHs. Meanwhile, the share of circulating supply that has not moved in at least five years is at 30% and has remained flat since May 2024. So, even though long-term holders are selling, as they typically do when prices climb higher, these data points suggest that the broader cohort has not significantly changed its aggregate behavior for over a year now, implying that many are waiting for higher prices before making further moves.

2025-07-04T11:51:24,"Solana Price Prediction Experts Now Eyeing Bitcoin Solaris as the Faster Route to Bitcoin-Level Wealth","For years, Solana held its position as the rising star of blockchain speed. But as experts project a slight dip in SOL’s price by July 2025, the spotlight has started to shift. The new name echoing across forums, trading groups, and even TikTok isn’t another Ethereum clone or meme coin. It’s Bitcoin Solaris, and it’s being pitched as the serious contender for those who missed out on early Bitcoin riches. This isn’t just a token play. It’s a full-on blockchain overhaul that’s making wealth generation mobile, fast, and ridiculously accessible. So what’s making SOL bulls glance sideways at BTC-S? The answers are both technical and economic, and they’re worth your full attention. Solana Holds Strong, But the Fire’s Moving Elsewhere Let’s be clear: Solana isn’t going anywhere. With its high throughput and low fees, it remains one of the most efficient networks in the space. It’s fast, it’s battle-tested, and it continues to power countless DeFi and NFT projects. However, recent predictions forecasting a small decline in SOL’s price have traders exploring alternative paths to serious upside. That curiosity is now pointing directly toward Bitcoin Solaris. While Solana thrives on speed, Bitcoin Solaris combines speed with accessibility, wealth-building tools, and a Bitcoin-style scarcity model. The comparison is no longer about performance alone. It’s about who can help everyday users actually get rich, and BTC-S is making a very strong case. What Is Bitcoin Solaris and Why Is Everyone Suddenly Talking About It? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is a dual-layer blockchain platform that aims to combine the best of Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s performance, and then take it further. It’s not a fork. It’s a complete reimagining of what crypto wealth could look like if you didn’t need to buy expensive hardware or study Solidity just to participate. At its core: It’s powered by a hybrid Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake model It can process up to 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality It consumes 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin It’s built to be mined by anyone through the upcoming Solaris Nova app And it’s preparing to launch its own native blockchain after a short Solana-based rollout That last part is key. You can mine BTC-S from your phone. Literally. Whether you’ve got an Android or an old MacBook, the upcoming Solaris Nova App will let you earn tokens directly from your device. This kind of mobile-first mining is no gimmick. It’s backed by adaptive algorithms that balance energy use and power output, and yes, it works. In fact, you can test how much you’d earn using their mining tool at this calculator . Inside the Engine: Why This Tech Could Actually Outpace Bitcoin Under the hood, Bitcoin Solaris is doing things differently: Dual-Layer Architecture: A secure base layer (PoW) and a lightning-fast application layer (DPoS) Validator Rotation: Ensures decentralization and prevents network abuse Rust-Based Smart Contracts: Enabling real-world apps from DeFi to healthcare Up to 100,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer using dynamic block sizes Full cross-chain capability, with bridges in development to move assets across ecosystems Zero-Knowledge Proofs and long-range attack mitigation for top-tier security Not Just Crypto Evolution: This Is Financial Liberation If this all sounds intense, that’s because it is. But for those diving into the documentation, it becomes clear: Bitcoin Solaris is not just another whitepaper dream. It’s already hit milestones like successful testnet launches, a growing ecosystem, and over 13,650 presale participants. The entire infrastructure has been independently verified as well. Security audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins confirm the system’s robustness. Why the Presale Is Breaking All the Rules While some projects spend six months in presale limbo, Bitcoin Solaris is executing one of the most aggressive launches in the space. Phase 10 is currently live, with the price at $10, climbing to $11 in the next phase and aiming for a $20 launch. That’s a projected 150% return if you get in before July 31, 2025. Here’s what’s adding fuel to the fire: Over $6 million raised already More than 13,650 unique users onboarded Only about four weeks left until the presale ends Considered one of the shortest, most explosive presales of the year To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask for smooth delivery. And if you’re looking to stack even more tokens, the referral program is wild. It gives both you and your invitee a 5% reward. You can learn all about it here . The Hype Is Real, And It’s Spreading Fast From Telegram threads to YouTube breakdowns, influencers and crypto enthusiasts are digging into Bitcoin Solaris like it’s the next Ethereum. A recent detailed review by Crypto Show explained why the project’s speed, mining flexibility, and tight scarcity design are catching fire. Meanwhile, community chatter on Telegram and on X is showing no signs of slowing down. It’s a rare moment when the tech, narrative, and presale numbers all align, and BTC-S seems to be right in that zone. To see why some are calling it the “faster route to Bitcoin-level wealth,” check out their ecosystem and presale info directly at Bitcoin Solaris . You’ll also find insights on how to prepare for the upcoming Solaris Nova App launch. Final Verdict: Blink and You’ll Miss It Solana might still hold court among the top-tier chains, but if you’re chasing life-changing upside, Bitcoin Solaris is the one to watch. With real mining from your phone, verified infrastructure, and a community-first rollout, it offers a faster, more open road to serious crypto gains. This isn’t about ditching Solana. It’s about recognizing the moment when the wealth engine starts warming up somewhere new. And for now, all signs point toward Bitcoin Solaris.

2025-07-04T11:51:18,"Chainlink Investors Diversify: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Promises Bitcoin-Level Returns with 10,000 TPS Technology","The post Chainlink Investors Diversify: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Promises Bitcoin-Level Returns with 10,000 TPS Technology appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a world where crypto veterans have learned that the early bird doesn’t just get the worm but sometimes the Lambo too, a new headline is starting to circulate: “Chainlink holders are diversifying.” And no, it’s not out of boredom. It’s because Bitcoin Solaris has entered the scene, and it is not just another altcoin promising the moon. It is a meticulously engineered system that blends Bitcoin’s foundational ethos with a modern DeFi-ready infrastructure. At the core of it all? An architecture that’s geared for growth, speed, and massive profit potential. Chainlink Is Solid, But It’s Not the Whole Picture Chainlink has carved out its role as the middleware of crypto, bringing real-world data to smart contracts. That’s useful. That’s valuable. But for the average investor looking for the kind of life-changing upside that Bitcoin provided in its early days, LINK’s potential growth is more evolutionary than explosive. It’s already established, widely integrated, and its price often moves at the speed of news headlines. Investors seeking bigger upside are now starting to hedge. And Bitcoin Solaris is where that spotlight is shifting. The Bitcoin Solaris Formula: 10,000 TPS Meets Mobile Wealth Creation What’s attracting thousands to Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just hype. It’s tech. BTC-S introduces a dual-layer system with a hybrid consensus model that combines Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This combo keeps things decentralized and secure while enabling lightning-fast transaction speeds. The specs say it all: Base Layer (PoW): 3,000 TPS Solaris Layer (DPoS): 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality Validator rotation every 24 hours with strict slashing conditions Rust-based smart contracts optimized for cross-chain dApps Unlike Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time, Bitcoin Solaris closes blocks every 15 seconds on the Solaris Layer, ensuring scalability and usability for real-world applications. This Isn’t a Trend, It’s the Start of a Blockchain Evolution Add to that the fact that its upcoming mobile app, the Solaris Nova App, allows users to mine BTC-S with no complex hardware setup. This is the part that makes people perk up. Through the exciting release of the app, anyone with a smartphone becomes a miner. No need to manage rigs, just real rewards from real participation. And to estimate potential profits, users are already playing with the mining calculator . Why the Presale Is Heating Up Bitcoin Solaris is in phase 10 of its presale, and things are moving fast. The current price is $10. Next stop? $11, and a launch at $20. That’s a potential 150% gain from now to day one trading. More than 13,650 users have joined so far. And with only about four weeks remaining, this may go down as one of the shortest, most explosive presales of the year. Even wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are officially recommended for receiving BTC-S on launch day, making onboarding seamless. This kind of growth doesn’t go unnoticed. A detailed review by Token Galaxy breaks down why so many enthusiasts believe this is the next breakout coin. And yes, the numbers speak for themselves: Over $6 million raised Rapid community expansion Audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins Live discussion happening in the official Telegram and X account A Blueprint Built for Generational Wealth Here’s the bigger picture: Bitcoin Solaris is not just about TPS and token price. It’s about ecosystem readiness. Developers can already build DeFi, NFT, gaming, supply chain, and IoT dApps using Rust contracts on a high-speed, low-fee chain. That opens the door for: Carbon credit trading and sustainability markets Healthcare apps for secure patient data Blockchain-based education credentials Real estate tokenization and smart rentals But it’s the wealth-building mechanisms that are catching attention. The network uses a hybrid mining model, distributing 40% of rewards to Base Layer miners and 25% to Solaris Layer validators. This ensures long-term sustainability and allows daily participants to earn directly from the activity. In other words, Bitcoin Solaris is the first major project since early Bitcoin to put meaningful mining power in your pocket without any technical friction. BTC-S vs LINK: A Different Kind of Upside While Chainlink remains a key infrastructure player in crypto, its token’s role is primarily functional. Bitcoin Solaris, by contrast, is offering a network that not only fuels infrastructure but also makes it accessible, mineable, and profitable at the user level. Feature Chainlink (LINK) Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) Consensus Mechanism None (uses ETH validators) Hybrid PoW + DPoS TPS Performance Relies on the host chain Up to 100,000 TPS Native Mining No Yes, via the upcoming mobile app Early-Stage ROI Moderate High potential (150% presale return) Smart Contract Focus Oracle layer only Full dApp support (Rust-based) Network Architecture Single layer, external node Dual-layer, internal validator sync It’s clear that Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just build utility, it builds opportunity. Final Thoughts Chainlink’s investors know how to spot value. And right now, many are quietly diversifying into Bitcoin Solaris. The reasons are obvious. The project isn’t just fast and efficient, it’s early, accessible, and designed to replicate the kind of massive upside that Bitcoin offered in its infancy.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 468,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is likely on the verge of an explosive breakout from its trading range. “The bid on BTC is relentless. When this thing finally breaks out of this range it will leave people in awe.” Next up, the analyst responds to crypto investor TraderJB’s comment on X that Bitcoin’s fifth wave may extend nearly 4.236 times the net travel of waves one through three based on historical precedence, which would put BTC at a cycle peak at around $264,000. Credible Crypto uses Elliott Wave theory, which depicts price movement in a series of waves based on crowd psychology. Under the theory, price impulses to the upside happen in five main waves, and according to the trader, BTC is in the midst of its fifth and final wave. “Two times may just be a coincidence, but it’s worth noting that the expected target, if it happens a third time, does fall within the range that I’ve been talking about for years now for the end of this final fifth wave (above $100,000, below $300,000). We have a significant amount of PA (price action) to develop to the upside before we can get a better estimate of where the final push may land but keeping this in the back of my mind.” Source: Credible Crypto/X Bitcoin is trading for $109,819 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the analyst says Ethereum ( ETH ) may surge to around $3,400 if BTC breaks out. “If this plays out on BTC would be looking for something similar on ETH. One more month of chop, then full send?” Source: Credible Crypto/X ETH is trading for $2,594 at time of writing, flat on the day. Lastly, the analyst predicts that payments blockchain token XRP may hit about $18 this cycle, after buying the digital asset for $0.18 in 2019. “I do expect [XRP] to be up over 100x. Taking a bit longer than expected, but you won’t see me complaining about a 100x ‘taking too long.'” The analyst suggests that XRP first needs to break through a key resistance level against BTC (XRP/BTC) at 0.00002162 BTC ($2.36) to hit his double-digit price target.

2025-07-04T11:30:12,"Analyst Says Sell XRP Now Before 72% Price Crash To $0.6","XRP remains one of the most actively discussed cryptocurrencies on social media, with expectations that its price has yet to plateau. Things like the Ripple battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) coming to an end and Bitcoin expected to resume its uptrend have fueled expectations of the XRP price reaching new all-time highs. However, amid the calls for higher prices, a crypto analyst has warned that a major crash could be on the horizon for the altcoin. Why The XRP Price Will Crash Crypto analyst Xanrox took to the TradingView website to share thoughts on why they believe the XRP price is headed for a massive crash. The analyst explains that after the 600% rally that brought XRP to new 5-year peaks, it has lost steam and could be headed downward. The first thing is the fact that the price has been ranging for years , and even with the price jump back in 2024, Xanrox does not believe that the ranging has ended. This range began in 2017 and even after breaking above $3 briefly, the price remains inside of an ascending triangle, which is bearish at the current level. There is also the fact that the analyst points out that the pump created a large Fair Value Gap (FVG). The thing about FVGs is that they tend to be filled, especially after the price has ranged for as long as XRP has, and unfortunately, the FVG lies towards lower levels. The crypto analyst also calls out the fact that the XRP price is known for making weird moves and taking liquidity from traders while ranging. Historically, XRP has had more down periods than up , suggesting that bears often dominate the cryptocurrency. How Low Can The Price Go? The crypto analyst believes that the XRP price has already topped out, and thus, it’s time for investors to start thinking about exiting their positions. For one, even at $2.1, Xanrox says the price is still extremely high, especially sitting at the top of an ascending triangle. From here, they expect that the price will crash back down toward $0.6 , which is where the price started before the 600% increase in 2024, suggesting a 72% decrease in price. For investors who bought into the coin before the rally , the analyst advises that they start thinking about locking in profits at this level. For those who bought after the pump, they speculate that they got in at the top and should be looking to get out at breakeven or even eat a small loss to exit the position. Last but not least, for futures traders, the crypto analyst advises exiting any positions entered before the crash and switching to short positions if they want to make money on XRP.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/sell-xrp-72-price-crash-0-6/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|crypto|crypto news|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T11:20:47,"Analysis: Bitcoin could reach $120K in July amid BTC market maturity","Bitcoin is showing signs of strength heading into July, with low volatility, steady demand, and historical trends suggesting the price could soon make a sharp move higher. A July 4 report from Matrixport suggests that if seasonal trends continue and capital flows stay consistent, Bitcoin ( BTC ) could reach $120,000 this month. According to the report, realized price swings have now reached multi-year lows, indicating a significant decline in volatility. The market may be maturing as the one-week implied volatility is in the 30s, which is calm by Bitcoin’s standards. Institutions are taking notice of this decreased volatility. When price movements are predictable, many large investors who were previously cautious due to risk controls are more likely to participate. Since April, almost $14 billion has poured into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which is about $4 billion more than the price action alone would imply. Matrixport analysts say this suggests strong long-term demand rather than short-term trading. You might also like: $1B in Bitcoin moves from Satoshi-era wallet after 14 years of inactivity However, not everything is working in Bitcoin’s favor. Crypto market inflows are generally slowing down. Inflows are expected to be around $291 billion in 2025 at the current rate, which is significantly less than the $377 billion in 2024. With a multiplier effect of 2x to 2.5x for every dollar invested, it now takes more capital to push prices much higher than in past cycles. Wall Street is involved as well. Equities are still a common way for institutions to get exposure to the cryptocurrency market, and more than $100 billion in IPOs related to the cryptocurrency space are anticipated . With this kind of activity, Wall Street has a clear incentive to maintain the momentum, and may boost the market during slow periods. July has historically been a profitable month for Bitcoin. With an average return of roughly 9%, it has closed positive in seven of the previous ten years. In the upcoming weeks, Bitcoin may test the $116,000–$120,000 range if that pattern holds true, especially with improved sentiment in equity markets and a more supportive Fed backdrop. But to break through that ceiling, a fresh surge of inflows might be required. Without fresh capital, particularly from retail or new institutions, the rally could fade into another round of sideways trading.

On Thursday, the platform met with SEC officials to discuss digital asset issuance, commodities, and tokenized securities. Need for Consistent and Progressive Crypto Rules According to the memo , SIFMA urged the SEC to establish consistent and progressive rules for crypto and a clear regulatory approach for platforms involved in digital assets. SIFMA also encouraged the SEC to establish innovative approaches that match the current technological advancements. It also suggested that the SEC take a ‘holistic approach’ to incorporate— technological updates, classification of securities and digital commodities, open development of digital securities with transparency, and provision of cross-border applicability in the crypto landscape. Key Highlights of SIFMA’s Meeting with the SEC The initiative aims to integrate traditional finance (TradFi) with the crypto space, with major crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). SIFMA also seeks to promote regulatory clarity with consistent and progressive crypto rules to foster innovation and facilitate merging TradFi into the crypto market in the US. The effort also aims to establish a unified regulatory approach for issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets. SIFMA also highlighted that the SEC should ensure the functions of— exchange and broker-dealer, trading and custody, promoting competition and compatibility of service providers— in digital commodities, and tokenized securities. [post_titles_links postid=”478482″] Promoting the Adoption of Digital Assets SIFMA, holder of nearly 90% of the US financial market share, noted the growing demand of TradFi players to adopt digital assets into their products and services. So, it proceeded to establish legal clarity on the regulatory approach for cryptocurrency. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins emphasized the necessity of establishing clear rules in crypto, he said– “To establish clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets, aiming to protect investors while encouraging responsible innovation.” Final Thought SIFMA continues to develop and encourage the regulatory framework for digital assets in the US. This move comes at a time when the nation is already at its peak of embracing digital assets by implementing a series of new laws. Despite the regulations, the approach lacks legal clarity, which will probably be resolved with with SIFMA proposal.

As Bitcoin edges toward new highs and altcoins follow suit, DOGE price has climbed steadily, capturing attention with its trademark blend of community power and price volatility. Beyond memes, Dogecoin is benefiting from rising speculation around potential ETF inclusion, along with broader adoption through social media platforms and integrations. The question now: Is Dogecoin preparing for another breakout or just enjoying a temporary revival? ETF Buzz: Could Dogecoin Be Next? The excitement around a potential Dogecoin ETF is growing rapidly in 2025 as major asset managers like Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise file applications with the SEC. The recent delays by the authorities have not dimmed optimism, with some of the analysts assigning a 90% chance of approval by the year-end. Therefore, if approved, it could unlock institutional interest with an increase in liquidity and legitimise the memecoin within the broader financial system. The next key date is August 17, 2025, when the SEC is expected to respond to the 21Shares application. DOGE has already seen bullish sentiment, driven by speculation surrounding this ETF. With the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs setting a precedent, Dogecoin could be the next in line for mainstream adoption. What’s Next: Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Reach $1 in 2025? If the short-term fractals are kept aside, the long-term price action displays huge potential for a continued ascending trend. After the latest rejection from a resistance zone between $0.2180 and $0.2327, the bulls are trying hard to elevate the levels back above $0.2, but the bears seem to have capitulated the range just below the resistance. The weekly chart analysis suggests the price has held the ascending trend line as a strong support and recently triggered a rebound. Besides, the weekly MACD, which has been within the negative range since the start of the year, displays a drop in selling volume and pressure. Meanwhile, the weekly DMI is about to turn bullish as the conversion line and base line are heading for a bullish crossover. Interestingly, the weekly candle has just turned into a bearish Doji, and historically, this has been followed by a range-bound consolidation, a small pullback and a massive rise. Therefore, the Dogecoin (DOGE) price is expected to remain compressed between $0.165 and $0.177 for a while, followed by a strong rise to the resistance zone between $0.218 and $0.232. A breakout from this range could help the price to achieve $0.25.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/dogecoin-price-prediction-for-july-2025-doge-price-strengthens-case-for-a-move-to-0-25/,"TRADING|DOGE|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins",cryptocompare

At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped 4.2% to $3.43 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $97.3 billion, notably down compared to yesterday’s $120 billion. TLDR: The crypto market turned downwards; BTC stands mostly unchanged at $108,836, while ETH fell 2% to $2,547; ’All eyes are now on the Fed, macro data, and further geopolitical developments’; ‘ETH has the stronger momentum narrative, but BTC’s options market is coiled for a decisive move; US spot BTC ETFs recorded the highest positive daily flow in six weeks, spot ETH ETFs resumed inflows; ’Traders are betting on a big July’. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, only one of the top 10 coins per market cap is green. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 0.4%, meaning it’s mostly unchanged, currently trading at $108,836. Ethereum (ETH) has seen a drop of 2.1%, currently changing hands at $2,547. Dogecoin (DOGE) saw the highest decrease in this category: 4.4% to the price of $0.1673.

That said, “limited volatility spikes tell us markets were betting on limited fallout. That’s exactly what played out,” Dawson says. “The muted response in monthly volatility suggests traders correctly anticipated that hostilities would be contained.” Moreover, volatility trended lower across both ETH and BTC. The former’s 30-day implied volatility fell from 44% to 36% and the latter’s from 68% to 60%. BTC and ETH 30-day volatility Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata Dawson continues: “Traders are betting on a big July, with volatility suppressed and positioning split, all eyes are now on the Fed, macro data, and further geopolitical developments. ETH has the stronger momentum narrative, but BTC’s options market is coiled for a decisive move.” Upside catalysts for BTC to hit $130,000 include the US Federal Reserve rate cuts at the 29 July meeting (25% chance) and de-escalation in Israel’s war against Iran and Palestine. Downside catalysts that could result in the price retreating to $90,000 include a hawkish Fed tone, hot inflation print, increased tensions in the Middle East, ETF outflows, and miner capitulation. Finally, per Dawson, there’s a 10% chance that BTC will surpass $130,000 by the end of August, and a 15% chance ETH will surpass $3,300 in that same period. ETH sentiment is significantly more bullish than BTC’s, he says. “ Robinhood’s announcement of an L2 on Arbitrum for tokenized stocks in the EU could reignite the real-world asset (RWA) narrative around Ethereum.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $108,836.

The crypto market has dropped over the past 24 hours, while the US stock market saw another day of mixed performance on Wednesday. For example, the S&P 500 increased by 0.83%, the Nasdaq-100 went up by 0.99%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.77%. However, Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler , argues that Bitcoin “stands poised to follow equities to new highs.” This week saw a surge in optimism across US equity markets, with the S&P 500 hitting a new ATH. “If the S&P 500 holds above its previous February peak following the release of the Non-Farm Payrolls data in the coming weeks, it could serve as a strong technical and psychological catalyst not just for equities but also for the cryptocurrency market.” Is this dip sustainable? This appears to be another short-term dip in the market, marking minor decreases before additional pushes higher. In the medium term, analysts expect the prices to continue increasing overall, regardless of unavoidable drops.

2025-07-04T11:01:11,"Bitcoin returns to $110,000; GMO Miner cloud mining helps users earn daily passive income","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin’s rebound to $110,000 signals a new cycle of opportunity, one that platforms like GMO Miner are helping users navigate with stable daily passive income. Table of Contents Three major events in July How to earn stable crypto income amid high volatility GMO Miner platform advantages How to start the cloud mining journey Summary On Wednesday, Bitcoin ( BTC ) touched $110,000, hitting a new high since mid-June, with a 24-hour increase of 3.5%. At the same time, the Nasdaq index rose 0.8%, and global risk asset sentiment rebounded significantly. This round of rebound is not accidental, but a systematic recovery under the interweaving of multiple policies and market benefits. With the emergence of key events in July, the crypto market has quietly entered a new cycle of “high volatility + high opportunities”. Three major events in July 1. The US-Vietnam trade agreement boosted market confidence Trump announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam: the United States imposes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on transit goods; while the Vietnamese market is completely duty-free for US products. This policy is seen as a signal to stimulate exports, which not only improves market risk appetite but also benefits crypto assets. 2. The first Solana staking ETF is launched, and institutions are accelerating their entry The SSK fund issued by REX-Osprey has a first-day trading volume of over $20 million, far exceeding the first-day performance of the SOLZ ETF in March, indicating that staking assets have entered the mainstream vision and injected more certainty into the crypto infrastructure. 3. Three key time nodes will affect market trends July 5-7: The $3.3 trillion “One, Big, Beautiful Act” is expected to be signed, which may trigger a depreciation of the US dollar and an inflow of safe-haven funds. July 9: A new round of tariff measures will take effect, which may intensify global trade tensions. July 22: The US cryptocurrency executive order expires, and the national strategic BTC reserve plan may be announced. How to earn stable crypto income amid high volatility Compared with frequent transactions and high-risk games, more and more investors choose the GMO Miner cloud mining platform.
