2025-07-04T08:51:48,"Massive Whale Transfer Sparks Buzz as Bitcoin Eyes New ATH—Will BTC Break Records This Weekend?","The post Massive Whale Transfer Sparks Buzz as Bitcoin Eyes New ATH—Will BTC Break Records This Weekend? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price is trading around $109,100, close to its recent peaks above $110,300, as it attempts to rise above the latest selling pressure. Over the past 24 hours, the crypto has fluctuated between $108,800 and $110,550, reflecting modest but sustained volatility. Its weekly move is positive, up about 1.4%, driven by renewed institutional interest via US spot Bitcoin ETFs that attracted over $400 million in inflows, led by Fidelity’s FBTC. Along with the institutions, the whales are also seen preparing for a massive move, which could deeply impact the BTC price rally. Dormant Whale Wakes Up As A Billion USDT Ready to Flood Into the Markets As the Bitcoin price is displaying acute strength despite all the odds, the market conditions and sentiments are changing very often. The market participants continue to remain unsure of the price stability after the BTC price marks new highs, and as a result, the sentiments remain neutral. Meanwhile, some interesting transfers, minting and burning have occurred in the past 24 hours, which point towards an incoming volatility. Whale Alert has been posting a series of such transactions that could change the course of the rally in the coming days. Over 200 million USDC have been minted at the treasury, and more than 300 million have been transferred to Coinbase. Besides, a billion USDT has been minted at the Tether treasury, while 500 million XRP has been unlocked from the escrow to an unknown wallet. However, the main transfer that raised many eyebrows was the BTC whale waking up after a decade. After 14 years and 3 months, a dormant address with over 10,000 BTC has transferred all the cryptos to an unknown account. Whenever long-dormant BTC wallets suddenly move, traders brace for potential volatility. Moves to the exchanges can trigger panic and selling, while on the contrary, spikes in the old wallet activity often line up with major bull runs, signalling cycle transitions or profit-taking by early adopters. What’s Next for the BTC Price Rally? Will it $110,500 Resistance This Week? The short-term price action suggests the bulls are falling weak as they approach the final resistance zone before the ATH. The token has been trying hard to pierce through the zone, but the bears are taking out the profit, causing the price to drop, preventing the breach. Now that the upward pressure has mounted, the BTC price is now feared to drop back to the local support below $107,000. In the 4-hr chart, a clear rejection can be seen from the resistance zone between $110,025 and $110,563. Besides, the MACD is about to turn bearish as the levels are close to validating a bearish crossover. Meanwhile, the Stochastic RSI has already deviated lower, substantiating the bearish claim. Therefore, even though the price attempts a rebound, the lack of bullish strength could prevent a strong and sustained breakout above the range. Hence, considering the current chart patterns and market conditions, forming a new ATH this week could be a tedious job for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally. However, changes in the sentiment occur suddenly in the crypto space, which could squash the bearish dominance over the rally.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/massive-whale-transfer-sparks-buzz-as-bitcoin-eyes-new-ath-will-btc-break-records-this-weekend/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|USDT|REGULATION","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T08:50:44,"Here’s Why Bitcoin’s Price Doesn’t go up Despite Massive ETF and Corporate Buys","Early Bitcoin (BTC) whales have reportedly offloaded more than 500,000 BTC, worth about $50 billion at current rates, in the past year, an exit matched by institutional inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries. The churn, detailed in a recent Bloomberg piece, has kept the king cryptocurrency near its record highs while suppressing its more volatile nature, signaling a fundamental shift from speculative asset to institutional holding. The Great Bitcoin Handover According to Bloomberg, the BTC sales by early holders in the last year mirror net inflows into American spot BTC ETFs, indicating a near one-to-one handover. These sellers include miners, offshore funds, and anonymous wallets, many of whom accumulated their holdings when Bitcoin traded for mere hundreds. Some are now reportedly offloading their BTC for stock-linked financing deals, effectively exiting the crypto market through “in-kind” transfers. Meanwhile, institutional buyers, led by the ETFs, Michael Saylor’s Strategy, and a host of corporate imitators, are said to have accumulated nearly 900,000 BTC, pushing their combined holdings to 4.8 million BTC. This represents about one-quarter of the cryptocurrency’s 19.8 million circulating supply. Interestingly, a recent CNBC report revealed that corporate treasuries have been amassing more Bitcoin than their ETF counterparts for three straight quarters. Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows that Strategy alone holds 597,323 BTC worth over $65 billion, way more than the 527,648 BTC in the custody of governments around the world, but dwarfed by the 848,608 BTC collectively owned by public companies. Volatility Vanishing The Bitcoin sales in the past 12 months mark a dramatic powershift considering a study by Flipside Crypto estimated that five years ago, just 2% of anonymous accounts controlled 95% of Bitcoin. As DRW’s Rob Strebel told Bloomberg, “Crypto is becoming less of an outlier,” adding that the reduced volatility is a reflection of BTC’s growing status as a stable, long-term asset class. Strebel’s take on Bitcoin’s volatility wasn’t pulled out of thin air. Deribit’s BTC Volatility Index, which measures 30-day forward-looking annualized volatility expectations, has dropped to its lowest level in the last two years, potentially making Bitcoin “an attractive retirement asset,” as Arca CIO Jeff Dorman stated. BTC has displayed this steadiness at the markets recently, with a narrow 24-hour range between $108,871 and $110,386. It was trading at $109,155 at the time of this writing, reflecting a 3.5% rise in the last 30 days and a smaller 1.5% improvement over the past week to edge the broader crypto market, which went up 1.4% in that period.

2025-07-04T08:48:02,"Satoshi-era Bitcoin address moves $1 billion of BTC after 14 years","A long-dormant Bitcoin wallet dating back to the early days of the cryptocurrency has just moved 10,000 BTC , worth approximately $1.09 billion at the time of the transfer, marking one of the largest and most historically significant transactions of 2025. According to on-chain data, the wallet address 12tLs9c9RsALt4ockxa1hB4iTCTSmxj2me received exactly 10,000 BTC on April 3, 2011, when the price of Bitcoin was just $0.78 per coin. At the time, the total transaction was worth only $7,805. Bitcoin wallet address moves $1.09 billion in Bitcoin. BitInfoCharts After remaining inactive for 14 years, the coins were finally moved on July 4, 2025, when Bitcoin was trading at roughly $109,246 per BTC, netting a profit of $1,092,456,394 from price appreciation alone. The wallet has now been emptied entirely, with all 10,000 BTC transferred in a single transaction. It’s worth noting that this address had remained untouched for so long that it predates many key developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem, including the launch of major exchanges, institutional involvement, and even the creation of Ethereum. Who could own the Bitcoin wallet? While the wallet’s owner has not been identified, transactions of this size and vintage often spark speculation around Satoshi Nakamoto , Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator. However, blockchain analysts have previously mapped Satoshi’s coins and this address is not among the ones linked to the original miner. Still, the movement of such a massive amount of “virgin” Bitcoin is rare and tends to capture the attention of both the crypto community and regulators. Why now? The motive behind the transfer remains unknown, but timing may be key. Bitcoin has recently returned to above $100,000, and liquidity conditions have improved following the rollout of multiple Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. It’s possible the owner timed the move to take advantage of favorable market conditions, or to finally cash in on a decade-old investment. Interestingly, this comes just as the number of Bitcoin millionaire wallets has surged, over 26,000 new addresses holding $1 million or more in BTC were added in the first half of 2025 alone. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Despite the massive dollar value, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable in the immediate aftermath, suggesting the transaction may have been OTC (over-the-counter) or to another personal wallet, rather than for immediate sale on an exchange.

2025-07-04T08:47:09,"Strategy: Unusual Insider Purchases Support Rating Upgrade","Summary Recent insider purchases surrounding Strategy caught my attention. These purchases are unusual considering the dominating insider selling both for MSTR and also the overall market. They signal a potential shift in insiders' sentiment and outlook for MSTR. But despite the record bitcoin price, MSTR still trades at a large premium to its bitcoin holdings and book value. MSTR stock’s recent insiders’ activities I last wrote on Strategy Incorporated (MSTR) stock about 1 year ago in May 2024 with an article titled ""MicroStrategy Stock: Sell With The Insiders”. Note that the company has changed its name to Strategy recently. That article focused on the near-term risks I saw at that time, in particular the insiders’ selling activities, and concluded with a sell rating. Since then, there have been a few material changes for the stock. In the remainder of this article, I will elaborate on the top 2 on my radar: the changes in insider activities and also the new outlook in bitcoin prices. These changes lead me to see an improvement in the return/risk ratio for MSTR and an upgrade rating to hold. Let me start with the insiders’ latest disclosures. The table below summarizes the insider transactions disclosed in the past 3 months. As you can see, the transactions were still dominated by selling activities, totaling more than $40.3 million. However, a few unusual purchases caught my attention. The most recent insider purchases were disclosed by Patten Jarrod on June 9, 2025. The director of MSTR bought 5,000 of MSTR’s preferred shares at a price of ~$85 per share for a total of $425k. Shao Wei-Ming, an EVP of MSTR, also disclosed a similar purchase with a sizable total of around $300k. Overall, insiders’ purchases in the past 3 months totaled more than $2.3 million. DataRoma MSTR stock: insider purchases in focus The above transactions were unusual in my mind for a couple of reasons. First, as just mentioned, MSTR’s insider transactions used to be completely dominated by sellers as detailed in my last article. Thus, the recent insider purchases could signal of a change of sentiment among the insiders. Second, the insider activities in the overall stock market have also been dominated by insider sales lately. For instance, the next chart displays the net buy/sell transactions in the overall market in the 2 months. As seen, the picture is heavily dominated by sales shown by the red bars. Insider purchases (shown by the green bars) are so dwarfed in comparison. Although, note that the above insider purchases were for MSTR’s preferred shares. As a background, MSTR recently issued three preferred stocks, a 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (NASDAQ: STRK ), a 10% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (NASDAQ: STRF ), and a 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (NASDAQ: STRD ). Preferred shares, of course, have different characteristics when compared to the common shares. However, my view is that the preferred and the common shares are based on the same business fundamentals. As such, I consider the purchase of the preferred shares disclosed by the insiders as a reflection of improved business fundamentals for MSTR, as detailed next. Insider transactions MSTR stock: bitcoin holdings The preferred shares, together with other sources of funds (to be detailed more later), provide more financial resources for MSTR to continue to acquire Bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) and also invest in its infrastructure. Of course, such a strategy is sustainable in the long term only if BTC shows sufficient price appreciation. The developments surrounding BTC since my last writing, especially the potential policy changes from the Trump administration, have led me to feel more optimistic about the long-term potential of BTC. Thanks to the improved prospects of BTC and also the large price rally since my last writing, MSTR’s bitcoin holdings have enjoyed a drastic expansion in valuation. As seen, the company has held Bitcoin since 2020 and continued to add to its position. It currently holds 597,325 BTC with an average cost of around $70,982. With the current BTC price, this results in a significant gain of close to 55%. The current market value of these Bitcoin holdings is $65.64 billion. Source: bitcointreasuries.net Despite this substantial rise in its Bitcoin valuation, MSTR’s current overall market capitalization of $114.4 billion still is at a large premium over its direct Bitcoin holdings and/or its book value. As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin's value accounts for only about 57.4% of its market cap. In terms of book value, the current stock price represents a ratio of more than 3.55x as you can see from the following chart. Seeking Alpha Other risks and final thoughts There are certainly some reasons that could help to justify the above premium over its BTC holdings and/or book value. To start, I consider MSTR a leveraged play on BTC due to its ability to raise capital via debt, the preferred shares mentioned above, and also equity offerings. This ability to raise capital, combined with the company’s expertise to use various strategies, certainly justifies some premium. Secondly, while MSTR is almost synonymous with Bitcoin in many investors’ mind, it is fundamentally an enterprise software company with organic operating income. Its operation segments, even if overshadowed by Bitcoin, still generate revenue and profits and should, of course, add to the company’s valuation. In terms of downside risks, MSTR's cash flow from operations has seen quite small and very unstable though as you can see from its following cash flow statement. Over the past 2 years, the company reported a positive cash flow for 3 of them. In the past quarters since June 2024, the company has been reporting negative cash from operations of in the range of -$23.3 million to -$2.4 million in the most recent quarters. In the meantime, Capital expenditure has risen substantially. It totaled $1.1 million for the June and Sept quarters of 2024 but rose to $10.8 million in the December 2024 quarter and $8.7 million in the March quarter of 2025. Seeking Alpha As a result, the company has been relying heavily on debt financing. As shown in its following balance sheet, MSTR's long-term debt has surged considerably. In the past two years alone, its long-term debt has dramatically increased to the current level of $8,140 million from about $2,182 by the end of 2023. As just mentioned, such a leverage strategy is only sustainable for the long run if BTC prices keep appreciating in my model. To recap, this reexamination on MSTR (and also its associated preferred shares) is motivated primarily by changes since my last writing: the changes in insider activities and also the new outlook for bitcoin prices. After weighing these changes, I now see a better balance between its upside potential and downside risks, leading to a rating upgrade to hold.

2025-07-04T08:44:08,"Whales Are Selling Bitcoin, Companies Are Snapping Up All the Sales – What Does This Mean? Analysts Are Warning","There is a silent but effective power shift taking place in the Bitcoin market. While whales that have been holding large amounts of BTC for a long time in the $2.1 trillion BTC ecosystem are selling their assets, institutional investors such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate treasuries and asset managers are covering the majority of these sales. According to data from 10x Research, whales have dumped over 500,000 Bitcoins in the past year. That’s almost equal to the net amount of BTC flowing into U.S.-approved ETFs and very close to the roughly $65 billion BTC portfolio that MicroStrategy (now “Strategy”) has amassed over the past five years. But the sell-off has kept Bitcoin’s price stuck at $110,000. Despite rising institutional demand, volatility is gradually decreasing and Bitcoin is transforming from a speculative asset with high-yield prospects to an allocation vehicle for long-term portfolios. “We are seeing a movement at the bottom,” said Edward Chin, co-founder of Parataxis Capital, adding that this transformation is due to some whales using their BTC as collateral in direct stock-related transactions. According to Flipside Crypto, 95% of Bitcoin in 2020 was held by just 2% of wallets. But today, institutions ranging from ETFs to MicroStrategy and other institutional firms hold 4.8 million of the approximately 20 million Bitcoins in circulation, or nearly a quarter. According to Rob Strebel, director of Cumberland, DRW’s crypto arm, this development is turning crypto into a mainstream asset class and bringing with it lower volatility. In fact, Deribit’s 30-day BTC Volatility Index has fallen to its lowest levels in two years. Related News: Pantera Capital and Unexpected Altcoin Announce New Joint Investment of $250 Million But experts warn that this poses risks. The long-standing goal was to provide liquidity and an exit route for whales through institutional investors, according to Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University Washington College of Law. “That exit may now have been provided,” Allen says. Despite more than doubling the price of Bitcoin in the last two years, it has remained stagnant since entering 2025. Even US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric was not enough to push the price up. Some analysts now predict that Bitcoin's annual earnings potential could be capped at 10-20%. Arca CIO Jeff Dorman says, “Bitcoin could end up being a boring dividend stock over time. It's going up a little bit every year, but the rate of return is going down.” However, the picture is not completely clear. Not every whale movement can be tracked on-chain, and a new catalyst that could cause sudden changes in the market could emerge at any time. According to 10x Research, in the past, when whale sales were at 2% (2018) and 9% (2022), there were major crashes of 74% and 64% respectively. In a similar scenario today, the market could be thrown into disequilibrium once institutional demand stalls. “The market may be approaching its peak,” says Fred Thiel, CEO of bitcoin miner MARA Holdings. But he believes there is a different dynamic today. Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, says the transformation is long-term: “This process can take years. Bitcoin is now becoming an asset with a 10-20% return. Its nature is changing.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T08:31:32,"Time Traveler: XRP Making Millionaires and Billionaires Will Spread Quickly","In a bold post that has captured the imagination of the XRP community, prominent X user Time Traveler made a striking prediction: XRP’s rise will not only create millionaires and billionaires but will do so faster than anyone expects. “I think you underestimate how quickly XRP making millionaires and billionaires is going to spread,” he wrote. “The news and podcasts will explode talking about early investors… Conspiracies about us will spread. They will never know who we are, but they’ll know we exist. The underground syndicate of XRP.” This statement taps into a powerful and growing belief among XRP holders—that the token is on the verge of a monumental breakout that will turn early adopters into legends of the digital finance era. I think you underestimate how quickly XRP making millionaires and billionaires is going to spread. The news and podcasts will explode talking about early investors, and how could they have known? Conspiracies about us will spread. They will never know who we are, but they’ll know… — Time Traveler (@Traveler2236) July 2, 2025 From Legal Limbo to Launchpad XRP’s journey has been anything but smooth. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a prolonged legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since the agency filed a lawsuit in 2020. More recently, in June 2025, Judge Torres rejected the proposed settlement between Ripple and the SEC. Ripple would drop its counter-appeal, and it’s anticipated that the SEC will follow suit by dropping its appeal. Though the case technically remains open, the legal cloud that once hovered over XRP has largely lifted, clearing the path for broader adoption. The Early Believers Time Traveler’s message reflects the deep conviction among XRP’s earliest investors, people who have held firm through price suppression, regulatory fear, and public skepticism. Like early investors in Bitcoin or Ethereum, XRP supporters believe their patience and foresight will ultimately pay off with significant rewards. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The numbers support their optimism. Ripple has secured over 400 institutional partnerships, from central banks to global remittance firms. In Japan, XRP is already considered a financial standard, thanks in part to Ripple’s deep ties with SBI Holdings. And with XRP now listed in Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF , the asset is gaining exposure to traditional investors in regulated markets. The Hidden Wealth Class Time Traveler’s reference to the “underground syndicate” of XRP speaks to a broader cultural phenomenon in the crypto space, a quiet, decentralized wealth class that operates outside traditional financial systems. These investors are not celebrities or public figures. They’re everyday individuals who believed early, held through doubt, and are now positioned for generational wealth. As mainstream media and financial podcasts catch on to XRP’s rise, stories of overnight millionaires and early accumulators will flood the airwaves. Questions will arise: Who are these people? How did they know? Were they part of something secret? But, as Time Traveler suggests, the truth may never be fully revealed. Their identities will remain anonymous. Their foresight is undeniable, and their wealth is very real. The world will know they exist. But they’ll never know who they are.

2025-07-04T08:21:29,"Nano Labs acquired 74,315 BNB tokens worth $50 million","Nano Labs, a Nasdaq-listed company, has formally announced the start of its $1 billion Binance Coin (BNB) accumulation strategy with a $50 million over-the-counter purchase of 74,315 BNB tokens. The sale occurred at the average rate of $672.45 per token. This China-based chipmaker specializing in high-throughput computing chips used through Bitcoin mining and AI systems now has an estimated $160 million in digital assets, divided into Bitcoin and BNB. The company aims to ultimately own 5% to 10% of the total circulating supply of BNB, which will be financed using convertible notes and private placement. The BNB strategy also makes Nano the first U.S.-listed publicly traded company to regard Binance Coin as a treasury anchor. This strategy is unlike the general trend of most companies storing funds in either Bitcoin or Ethereum. As per Nano, the future purchase of BNB will be supported by zero-interest notes that can be paid in fiat or crypto, and the initial fundraising limit will be up to 500 million dollars. BNB buying spree backed by BTC liquidity The company announced that Nano Labs has raised 600 BTC or $63.6 million in its first convertible notes offering. Some of this reserve was rapidly yet strategically reflected into BNB, a reflection of a careful transition towards platform-native utility tokens. The treasury policy of the company became publicly visible when it disclosed that it had been harboring an unaccounted 400 BTC deposits in its coffers, which it had acquired at the price of $40 million. That earlier purchase predated the BNB pivot and has since grown vigorously through the new acquisition. The company said it would be making extra purchases, and its investors will get new types of convertible debt linked to Nano’s accumulation of crypto reserves. In addition to the arbitrary buildup, the shift by Nano is also positioned as its survival tool. The company recorded only $2.2 million in revenue in the second half of 2024, representing a 39% decrease compared to the previous year. The operating losses stood at $8.4 million. Still, during cost reduction programs, the losses were reduced partly by a 62% decrease in R&D. BNB price strengthens on treasury momentum BNB is performing well following the purchase by Nano Labs. The token is now emerging from a small, pinched consolidation range of $640 to $650, boosted by corporate purchases and a favorable Maxwell hard fork that brought BNB Smart Chain transaction throughput. BNB is currently trading at about $657 with its daily range of $657.85 to $664.79 at the time of press. The trading volume has declined by 5% in the last 24 hours. Technical indicators aid further upside. BNB has crossed the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has soared to 55.48, indicating moderate bullish momentum. On the weekly chart, the margin trader, The Boss, found a parallel ascending channel that BNB is still tracking. Once the breakout is confirmed, the price may go up to reach $900. Source: X Although the token is already up 18% year-to-date, it trails competitors such as Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX), which have posted a 45% and 121% increase, respectively.

2025-07-04T08:00:34,"Analyst Sees a Bitcoin Market Shift — Here’s What’s Happening","The Bitcoin market now appears to be seeing a notable surge in its momentum, with the asset finally breaching the $110,000 mark to inch really close to its all-time high. The asset has so far registered a 24-hour high of $110,117, less than 3% increase away from its all-time high of $111,814 registered in May. At the time of writing, BTC trades back at $109,000 levels, marking a 1.3% increase in the past day. While the price action alone has fueled speculation of an imminent breakout, several analysts suggest that deeper structural shifts within the market are at play. On-chain data particularly reveals changes in whale activity, exchange flows, and stablecoin dynamics that could offer clues about the market’s next move. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm—Bitcoin Could Explode Soon Signs of Reduced Bitcoin Selling Pressure and Upward Bias CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan shared a detailed view of the current state of Bitcoin’s price structure, emphasizing a broader directional change in the market that began in April. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s recent price resilience can be attributed to a noticeable decline in selling pressure from US-based institutional investors and whales. These large players, who were previously offloading significant holdings, have shifted into accumulation mode in recent months. Dan explained that Bitcoin appears to be in a transitional phase. He observed a gradual fade in sell-side activity from major US wallets since April, and that drop has been met with stable buying pressure. This suggests that institutions are no longer offloading positions but are maintaining or adding to their holdings. Dan added that the current consolidation, marked by Bitcoin’s price hovering above the $100,000 range, is allowing short-term overheated indicators to cool down. Dan noted: While the possibility of a correction remains, the broader market direction continues to be upward, so I will maintain my perspective and look forward to the second half of 2025. Overall, this could mean that the ongoing price action in the market may be the calm before a longer-term move upward, assuming macro conditions remain supportive. Exchange Outflows and Liquidity Trends Paint a Risk-On Picture Adding further context, another CryptoQuant contributor, Novaque Research, pointed to recent shifts in on-chain flows and broader liquidity conditions. According to their data, exchange outflows have picked up notably since late June, with some days seeing over 10,000 BTC withdrawn. Such behavior typically signals long-term investor confidence and a reduced likelihood of near-term sell pressure. Additionally, the report noted that miners have remained largely inactive in terms of selling despite BTC trading above $100,000. Related Reading: Whales Are Quietly Repositioning, Here’s What Bitcoin’s $107K Price Isn’t Telling You This suggests confidence in price sustainability and possible anticipation of more favorable financial conditions. Meanwhile, stablecoin activity has also shown key changes. Both USDC and USDT supply ratios on exchanges have been trending downward since mid-June, indicating capital is sitting idle rather than flowing into spot markets. Novaque noted that investors may be on the sidelines waiting for confirmation, but the structural behavior is leaning toward accumulation.

2025-07-04T07:58:55,"$1B in Bitcoin moves from Satoshi-era wallet after 14 years of inactivity","More than $1 billion in BTC was moved from a long-dormant “Satoshi era” wallet, reactivated just as Bitcoin edges toward a new all-time high. According to blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain, the wallet moved 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.09 billion, to a new address after lying untouched for 14.3 years. On-chain records indicate that the BTC was originally acquired on April 3, 2011, for just $109,246, translating to an average acquisition price of $0.78 per coin. As such, the whale is looking at returns of over 140,000x on the initial investment. While the exact motivations behind the massive transfer remain unclear, it comes at a time when Bitcoin ( BTC ) appears poised to reach a new all-time high, with analysts anticipating the milestone could be hit by the end of this week. Currently priced at $109,100, the leading cryptocurrency is just less than 3% away from surpassing its previous high. Such movements often precede selling activity, as large investors tend to accumulate at lows and realise gains near highs. It’s possible that the whale may be moving funds from a cold wallet to an exchange or a hot wallet. You might also like: No crypto wins in Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill,’ but market eyes liquidity boost In the meantime, sentiment among large Bitcoin holders appears to be shifting more broadly. On-chain analytics from Sentora reveal that whales holding over 1,000 BTC have gradually reduced their balances in recent weeks. While such distribution could exert short-term selling pressure, Sentora analysts argue this trend may represent a positive structural shift. “Rather than signaling weakness, this redistribution reflects a maturing market,” stated Sentora. “Older ‘whale’ coins are dispersing, a dynamic that should ultimately strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.” However, data from Glassnode offers a more nuanced counterpoint. The platform’s “Liveliness” metric, which measures the degree to which BTC holders are spending versus holding, has continued to trend downward. Source: Glassnode Unlike previous cycles where profit-taking surged as prices reached new highs, current behavior suggests long-term investors are maintaining their positions, even near peak valuations. Supporting this trend, the total BTC held by long-term holders , defined as those who have held for over 155 days, has reached a record high of 14.7 million coins. Notably, most BTC that were acquired near the $100,000 breakout threshold remain unmoved, reflecting growing conviction and reduced speculative pressure among investors. Institutions ramp up their BTC buying While long-term whale holders could be positioning their holdings for a sell-off, institutional investors have been steadily increasing their exposure to Bitcoin. Over the past week, multiple companies have announced ambitious plans to establish or expand Bitcoin treasuries. These include Fragbite Group , whose stock surged 64% after revealing its intention to allocate part of its balance sheet to BTC, and Vanadi Coffee , which gained over 240% in a month following shareholder approval to invest up to $1.1 billion in Bitcoin. Other firms that are jumping in include Belgravia Hartford , which disclosed it had secured $1 million in funding to grow its BTC treasury, while Norway-based Green Minerals announced a plan to raise $1.2 billion for the same purpose. The uptick in corporate interest shows growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, especially as it edges closer to price discovery territory. It comes as a growing number of analysts project even higher targets for BTC in the months ahead. According to crypto trader CryptoFayz, if Bitcoin breaks its current all-time high of $111,960, a continuation to $116,000 is likely, citing technical chart structures. Meanwhile, long-term projections remain even more bullish. Standard Chartered and Bernstein both forecast Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, while BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has set an even higher year-end target of $250,000.

The company has unlocked a 3,000% rally after announcing its $250M facility to build an ETH treasury. Bitmine was one of the latest treasury companies to unlock a stock rally. In the past two days alone, Bitmine rallied by more than 100%, reaching a price of $135 for the first time since April 2021. The latest stock rally launched after Bitmine announced a $250M private placement with the goal of acquiring and holding ETH. The price jumped additionally after the closing of the private placement on July 3. Bitmine rallied in the past day, following the closing of a $250M private placement deal with the goal of building an ETH treasury. | Source: Google Finance Bitmine started out from all-time lows, rising from a $1 mining stock to over $135 in the span of a week. Bitmine continues to rally as the leader to the pack of Ethereum treasury stocks , which joined the Bitcoin trend in the past few weeks. The growth trend also boosted the shares of Sharplink Gaming, rising further from $9.50 to over $12.60. SBET share prices are still down from their peak, but the recent recovery shows enthusiasm for ETH treasuries remains high. BitDigital, Inc. also rose to a one-month high of $2.94. ETH treasuries also allow companies to stake the tokens for additional passive income. Sharplink Gaming has already staked 95% of its ETH valued at over $450M. Bitmine plans dual BTC-ETH strategy Bitmine already holds 154.2 BTC, acquired at prices above $106,000 since June 16. The company has also hidden hashrate that would produce additional BTC inflows in the coming six months. Bitmine aims to use its private placement proceeds, along with BTC, to acquire more ETH and build its treasury. The company aims to acquire crypto for long-term holding, from a mix of BTC mining operations or from raising additional capital. Bitmine has direct mining operations, contracts in synthetic market, and hashrate as a financial product. Bitmine also works as a mining consultant, while also owning data centers in low-cost locations in Texas. Can Bitmine reawaken ETH? Demand for ETH has risen, based on ETF buying. The recent announcement of corporate treasuries is still not making a dent on the market. ETH remains a speculatively traded asset, with deliberate trading against long positions, leading to a depressed market price trading within a range around $2,500. ETH traded at $2,557.21, far from the exuberance of treasury company shares. The token stalled just under $2,700, falling on selling pressure. For bullish traders, ETH was supposed to make a hike to $3,000, though for now the rallies are cut short. Ethereum has seen increased staking and on-chain activity, with growing demand for DeFi. The network is slowly regaining its activity, mostly based on stablecoin usage. USDT and USDC drive traffic on Ethereum, as part of both centralized and decentralized activity. The recent treasuries are still not buying at the scale of Strategy, which is already affecting the BTC market. However, the appearance of a new wave of altcoin treasury companies may extend the 2025 crypto rally. Companies have already announced SOL and BNB treasuries, but ETH may be a prime candidate for reserves with guaranteed staking rewards.

The legislation, which promises deep tax cuts and sweeping spending reforms, is set to be signed into law on July 4 in a high-profile Independence Day ceremony. Republican Pushback Falls Short Despite Republican leadership rallying support, the bill faced opposition from within Trump’s party. GOP lawmakers Thomas Massie and Brian Fitzpatrick voted against it in the House, joining Senate Republicans Rand Paul, Susan Collins, and Thom Tillis, who opposed the bill earlier. Their concerns revolved around steep cuts to Medicaid, expanded tax breaks for the wealthy, and fears that the package could explode the national deficit. Yet, House Republicans managed to hold the line, persuading holdout Ralph Norman to flip his stance. With Vice President J.D. Vance previously casting the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, the path was cleared for the bill’s final approval. Economists Raised a Red Flag Economic analysts are sounding alarms. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the bill could add a massive $5.5 trillion to the national debt if the provisions become permanent. The U.S. debt, currently near 100% of GDP, could soar to 127% by 2034. Moody’s has also warned of growing investor unease and bond market volatility triggered by the legislation’s long-term fiscal risks. American Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unleashed a scathing attack on #DonaldTrump 's Big Beautiful Bill, warning it would strip coverage from 17 million Americans while raising taxes on those earning less than $50, 000. #BBB pic.twitter.com/U8YTkrkGzu — Good Point (@the_Good_Point) July 4, 2025 Whereas, the democrats, led by former President Joe Biden, labeled the bill “reckless and cruel,” warning it could strip healthcare from millions of Americans due to the proposed Medicaid cuts. Biden emphasized the bill favors the rich while threatening the social safety net. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, a one-time Trump ally, has voiced strong disapproval, signaling plans to campaign against lawmakers who backed it. What Comes Next? With the bill’s signing imminent, attention now turns to its implementation and its political fallout. As Trump pushes forward with his economic vision, critics are preparing for a fierce battle over the nation’s fiscal future, and voters will likely have the final say in 2026.

According to Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service that flagged the movement, the address last saw activity in 2011 when the balance was worth just $7,793. From Forgotten to Billion-Dollar Wallet The reactivation of such an old wallet is an extraordinary occurrence. The address likely dates back to the earliest era of Bitcoin, when the cryptocurrency was trading below $1 and mining was accessible to anyone with a basic computer. Over a decade later, this same stash now commands a fortune, illustrating the remarkable trajectory of Bitcoin’s rise. The transaction did not simply signal wallet access. The 10,000 BTC was moved out of the address in an outgoing transaction, confirming that the holder either recovered access to the wallet or had been deliberately holding it this entire time. On-chain data reveals that the coins weren’t transferred to an exchange, but rather redistributed to multiple new addresses, a common practice used to enhance privacy and obscure transaction trails. A dormant address containing 10,000 #BTC (1,092,973,486 USD) has just been activated after 14.3 years (worth 7,793 USD in 2011)! https://t.co/hzeryv3B5t — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 4, 2025 Speculation and Theories Erupt The crypto community reacted swiftly to the news, with many taking to X to share theories, concerns, and jokes. Calvin Weight questioned whether movements like this are why Bitcoin doesn’t rise despite major institutional purchases, posting: “Is this why BTC doesn’t go up in price when companies are buying billions of dollars?” Pablo Heman, known as Plan A, reignited the ever-present mystery of Bitcoin’s origins, asking: “What if this is Satoshi dumping?”—a theory that gains traction every time ancient coins begin to move. Others speculated the wallet owner may have only recently found the long-lost seed phrase. Chris commented, “They finally found the seed phrase, or we are all in trouble.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adding a touch of humor, user @Clearingkarma wrote: “Ross turned into a billionaire. Much wow!”—a tongue-in-cheek reference to Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road fame, though no evidence connects him to the address. Market Reaction and Broader Implications Surprisingly, the activation had little to no immediate impact on Bitcoin’s market price . This suggests that the BTC wasn’t sold, and reflects the market’s growing maturity. Historically, when old coins are moved, it often leads to market volatility. However, with current liquidity levels, the market appears better equipped to handle such movements without significant price swings. Still, the event highlights the ongoing mystery and legacy of Bitcoin’s early adopters. Whether this was a lost key finally recovered or a long-held strategic move, the sheer scale of the fortune involved serves as a stark reminder of the wealth still locked away in the blockchain’s early blocks. For now, the identity of the wallet owner remains unknown, but the crypto world is once again reminded that Bitcoin never forgets.

According to a July 4 analysis published on CryptoQuant by contributor Axel Adler, Chainlink ( LINK ) wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million LINK, often categorized as whale addresses, have now accumulated more than 85 million tokens. Since late 2022, this is the highest amount of whale-held supply. In contrast, retail holders have remained largely inactive, creating what Adler calls a “standoff” between deep-pocketed investors and smaller participants. This quiet accumulation phase has not yet translated into significant price movement. At press time, LINK is trading at $13.48, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours and about 7% lower over the past month. Over the last seven days, it has moved within a tight range between $12.76 and $13.96.

LINK is displaying some short-term strength, currently trading slightly above both its 10-day and 20-day moving averages. However, it remains below longer-term averages such as the 100-day and 200-day, indicating that the market is still hesitant . LINK may move toward $15 if it breaks above $14.10 with strong volume.

This new financial product could reshape Japan’s fixed-income market. With interest rates in Japan staying historically low, MetaPlanet plans to offer yen-denominated securities with high annual yields of 9 to 10 percent, using Bitcoin as collateral. The Problem in Japan’s Financial Market Crypto expert Adam Livingston explains that Japanese households hold over 2,200 trillion yen in financial assets. A large portion of this money is sitting in cash or deposits that earn less than 0.23 percent interest. Meanwhile, Japan’s annual inflation rate stands around 3.5 percent. In October 2024, it was 2.3 percent. It peaked at 4 percent in January 2025 and then stayed between 3.6 and 3.7 percent in the following months. This means most savings are losing value in real terms. The yield on Japan’s 10-year government bond is currently at 1.45 percent. In March, it was slightly higher at 1.63 percent. Japanese life insurers, who manage about 390 trillion yen, are now seeking better returns to meet long-term obligations. Livingston also notes that regulators in Japan are encouraging the development of new financial products that offer higher returns without adding foreign currency risks. MetaPlanet’s Solution: Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Stock MetaPlanet aims to address this issue by launching a preferred stock backed by Bitcoin. The stock will be issued in Japanese yen and offer high yields of 9 to 10 percent annually. Bitcoin is known for its long-term price appreciation and is often seen as a hedge against inflation. This makes it an attractive asset to back fixed-income securities. [post_titles_links postid=”478498″] Strategic Growth and Bitcoin Accumulation MetaPlanet is already a major Bitcoin holder, with at least 13,350 BTC, valued at over $ 1.45 billion. Livingston says the company can use funds raised through these preferred stocks to buy more Bitcoin. As their Bitcoin holdings grow, the value of the collateral increases. This could allow MetaPlanet to reduce coupon rates in future offerings and lower its capital costs. The company’s long-term goal is to accumulate 210,000 BTC , which would comprise approximately 1% of the total Bitcoin supply . A Major Shift in Japan’s Financial System Livingston believes this new offering is not just another product. It represents a major shift in Japan’s financial system. A yen-denominated, Bitcoin-backed investment could provide better yields for savers, modernize capital markets, and avoid the risks of foreign currency exposure. This move could set a new standard for fixed income investments in Japan.

MetaPlanet is addressing Japan’s financial market issues, where over 2,200 trillion yen in savings earn less than 0.23% interest while inflation runs around 3.5%. This new product offers significantly higher returns (9-10%) and is encouraged by regulators seeking new, higher-yielding, non-foreign currency risk financial products. How much Bitcoin does MetaPlanet currently hold? MetaPlanet is a significant Bitcoin holder, currently possessing at least 13,350 BTC, valued at over $1.45 billion. The company aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC, which would represent approximately 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, using funds raised from these preferred stocks to expand its holdings.

Yes, Italy accepts crypto for both payment and investment purposes. Cryptocurrencies are legally recognized as digital assets, though not legal tender. More businesses in cities like Genoa, Milan, and Florence are accepting crypto payments, and the country has one of the highest on-chain transaction volumes in the EU. Is Italy considered a crypto-friendly country for investors and businesses? Italy is increasingly crypto-friendly, especially with its adoption of the EU’s MiCAR framework in 2025. This provides a clear legal foundation for crypto, focusing on investor protection and transparency. While regulations are tightening, they aim to foster a secure environment, making Italy welcoming for crypto enthusiasts within defined legal boundaries. How do you pay crypto taxes in Italy, and what is the reporting deadline? In Italy, crypto taxes are paid via a “self-assessment” method through your individual tax return, typically using the LIFO (Last In, First Out) accounting method. Capital gains are considered “miscellaneous income.” Crypto taxes must be reported to Agenzia Entrate (the Italian tax authority) by October 15 each year. What countries currently have no or very low crypto taxes for individuals? Several countries currently have no or very low crypto taxes for individuals, making them attractive for crypto investors. Examples include Monaco, the UAE, Portugal, Malta, Singapore (no capital gains tax), Gibraltar, El Salvador (Bitcoin legal tender), and Belarus.

Similarly, when a large bitcoin (BTC) holder, often referred to as a crypto whale, moves its coins on-chain, that creates buzz on social media, prompting observers to wonder if it's a prelude to a sale and downside price volatility. Early Friday, two wallets, labelled "" 12tLs...xj2me "" and "" 1KbrS...AWJYm, "" moved 20,000 BTC, worth over $2 billion, to new addresses, according to data tracked by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain . The addresses received these coins on April 3, 2011, when bitcoin was priced at around 78 cents. Today, BTC is over $109,000, implying a staggering 140,000-fold return for the two whale addresses, which means that they have a strong incentive to liquidate their holdings. Many long-term holders have been selling their coins ever since BTC crossed above $100,000 in May. That said, the latest transfers were made to non-exchange addresses, which have gone silent since receiving these coins. So, it's too early to conclude that the transfer operation is aimed at taking profits.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/04/bitcoin-whales-wake-up-from-14-year-slumber-to-move-over-usd2b-of-btc,"BTC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Blockchain|Whales|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T07:14:09,"There's a $3.6 Billion Options Earthquake in Bitcoin and Ethereum Today! Here's Everything You Need to Know…","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin has made an attack in recent days, rising from the level of $ 105,000 to the level of $ 109,000. While it remains uncertain whether this rise will continue, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. According to the first weekly data for July, $3 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $612 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on July 4 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 1.05, the maximum loss point is $ 106,000 and the notional value is $ 3 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 1.24, a maximum loss point of $2,500, and a notional value of $612 million. The maximum pain point is the level at which the price of a cryptocurrency settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin prices as the $3 billion options expiration on July 4th. While the maximum pain point is at $106,000 for BTC and $2,500 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. What Does the Put/Call Ratio Signal for Bitcoin and Ethereum? The put/call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of put options by the number of call options. A ratio below 1 means there are more buys than puts, indicating an uptrend. A ratio above 1 means there are more puts than calls, indicating a downtrend. A ratio close to 1 means the market is balanced or neutral. For Bitcoin, this ratio is 1.05, while for Ethereum it is 1.24. For BTC, this ratio is 1 and indicates a balanced, sideways market, while for Ethereum, this ratio is above 1 and indicates a downward trend. However, time will tell how these rates will affect the price. At this point, do not make your investment decisions based on a single data or report. *This is not investment advice.

Krüger tells his 211,500 followers on the social media platform X that the “upcoming Bitcoin breakout will be explosive.” According to the economist and trader, one of the catalysts that will drive the Bitcoin rally he foresees will be the legislation currently waiting to be passed in the U.S. Congress known as the One Big Beautiful Act (OBBA). The omnibus legislation addresses some of President Trump’s election campaign promises. The economist and trader says the accumulation of Bitcoin by companies intending to include the flagship crypto asset in their balance sheets is another catalyst that will “add fuel to the fire.” Additionally, the economist and trader says the Federal Reserve Chair set to be appointed in 2026 to replace the current Chair Jerome Powell will be the “icing on the cake.” According to Krüger, Powell’s replacement will be a bullish catalyst over the short term. The economist and trader further says Bitcoin’s current price action is operating in a similar environment to five years ago. “When it comes to analogies across cycles and Bitcoin Treasury companies, June 2025 is analogous to December 2020 and the Bitcoin Grayscale trade.” In December of 2020, Bitcoin broke above the then all-time high of around $20,000 that had been in place for three years. The rally occurred at a time when the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) was trading at a significant premium to the net asset value of the underlying Bitcoin amid robust institutional demand.

2025-07-04T07:03:13,"Solo Bitcoin Miner Strikes Gold, Nets Nearly $350,000 from Single Block","A solo Bitcoin miner has defied extraordinary odds, successfully mining an entire block and earning just under $350,000 in Bitcoin rewards. Key Takeaways: A solo miner beat 1-in-2,800 daily odds to mine a Bitcoin block and earned nearly $350,000. The miner’s modest 2.3 PH/s setup shows small operators can still strike it big despite low odds. Industrial miners scaled back output in June, highlighting contrasting fortunes with solo successes. The miner, working through the CKpool solo mining pool, used a rig producing 2.3 petahashes per second (PH/s) to solve block 903883, according to mining data from Mempool Space . Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo pointed out the rarity of the event , calling it a remarkable feat. Solo Miner Faces 1-in-2,800 Daily Odds to Solve a Bitcoin Block The CKpool administrator explained that a miner operating at 2.3 PH/s has only about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block on any given day, or roughly one success every eight years on average. At current network difficulty, that’s just a 0.004% chance per day. The solo miner’s block yield included a reward of 3.173 BTC, valued at approximately $349,028 at the time. While the miner’s exact hardware setup remains unclear, experts believe it likely involved several older-generation ASIC rigs combined to reach the modest hashrate of 2.3 PH/s. By contrast, smaller hobbyist machines like Bitaxe or USB-based NerdMiner units produce only terahashes or kilohashes per second, making their chances of hitting a full block effectively negligible. BREAKING: A SOLO MINER JUST MINED AN ENTIRE #BITCOIN BLOCK WORTH OVER $350,000 THEY BEAT INCREDIBLE ODDS pic.twitter.com/Cp5xV7ZlKR — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) July 3, 2025 For solo miners aiming to mine a block every month, an estimated 166,000 terahashes per second, equivalent to about 500 Antminer S21 Hydro machines, would be required, a setup costing millions of dollars. Yet the latest lucky miner’s success proves that, in solo mining, probability can sometimes favor even modest operators. The win follows similar solo miner victories earlier this year. In February, a solo miner hit block 883,181 for over $300,000 in rewards, and another solo miner mined block 899,826 in early June, earning roughly $330,000. Meanwhile, major industrial Bitcoin mining firms such as Riot Platforms, Cipher Mining, and MARA Holdings reported lower output in June. The companies scaled back operations in Texas to sidestep peak demand charges during the state’s expensive summer electricity periods. Chinese Roots Still Dominate Global Bitcoin Mining As reported, over half of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations still trace their origins to China , with 55% to 65% of mining linked to Chinese capital, hardware, or expertise, according to Uminers CEO Batyr Hydyrov. Despite China’s 2021 mining ban, key Chinese players have maintained influence by relocating operations overseas. Major Chinese manufacturers Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, responsible for 99% of Bitcoin mining hardware, have shifted production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, helping boost America’s share of Bitcoin’s total hashrate from 4% in 2019 to 38% today. Hydyrov added that former Chinese miners have often increased capacity after moving abroad, with some expanding by up to 150%, and noted that limited mining still persists within China’s remote regions where enforcement is lax.

2025-07-04T07:00:24,"Bitcoin’s Latest Profit-Taking Spree Was Driven By HODLers: Data","On-chain data suggests the veterans of the Bitcoin network were the ones that took profits during the latest market selloff. Older Bitcoin Groups Recently Realized A Large Amount Of Profit In a post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed how profit-taking has been distributed among the various Bitcoin cohorts. The groups in question have been divided based on the age of their holdings. The 1 year to 2 years cohort, for example, includes the holders who have been carrying their coins since between one and two years ago, without having involved them in a transaction even once. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their tokens, the less likely they become to move them at any point. As such, cohorts on the older side include the more resolute hands. The investors with a holding time under six months are termed as the “ short-term holders .” Since these investors have a relatively low age, they often easily participate in selling. According to Glassnode, however, this cohort who’s generally involved in profit-taking sprees hasn’t played much of a role during the recent profit-taking event in the sector. So, who has been the culprit? The data of the Realized Profit by Age holds the answer. The Realized Profit measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of profit that the Bitcoin investors are realizing through their transactions. The Realized Profit by Age is a modification of this indicator that separates the profit being realized by the different age cohorts. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the metric specifically for the more aged side of the market (holding time greater than one year). As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit has recently shot up for the veteran groups of the network. During this profit-taking spree, the 3 years to 5 years investors realized the most gains at $849 million. This cohort contains the investors who bought the cryptocurrency during the previous cycle. It would appear that the recent $100,000 prices finally proved enough for them to break their dormancy. More interesting, however, is the cohort who took the second most profits: the 7 years to 10 years holders with a Realized Profit of $485 million. Coins that enter an age so old are generally assumed to be lost, either due to being forgotten or having their keys misplaced. Thus, it’s possible that these sales were made by investors who rediscovered old wallets. Though, there is also a chance that there were some genuine HODLers sprinkled among these, in which case, they would have certainly deserved the fruits of their conviction. The third largest Bitcoin profit-taker has been the 1 year to 2 years cohort with an indicator value of $445 million.

2025-07-04T07:00:00,"Bitcoin Latest Rally Backed By Stronger Purchasing Power: Report","Data of the Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio suggests investors have stronger purchasing power today than during the previous bull rally. Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio Showing Neutral Purchasing Power In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) of Bitcoin. This indicator measures the ratio between the Bitcoin supply and the supply of stablecoins. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bounces Back With 8% Gain—Is $0.26 In Sight? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that have their price tied to a fiat currency. The SSR specifically measures the supply of the stablecoins tied to the US Dollar (USD). As for the role that these assets play in the sector, Glassnode explains: Stablecoins have become a critical component of the digital asset ecosystem, serving as the primary quote asset for trading across both centralized and decentralized venues. Functionally, they represent readily available capital, or “dry powder”, available for digital asset purchases. As such, the SSR compares the Bitcoin supply against this available dry powder. In other words, it tells us about how the cryptocurrency compares against the investor’s purchasing power. When the value of the metric is high, it means the BTC supply is high compared to the stablecoin supply. In other words, the trader’s purchasing power is weak. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests there is high dry powder available relative to the BTC supply. In the context of the current discussion, the SSR itself isn’t of focus, but rather a modified indicator called the SSR Oscillator. According to the analytics firm, the metric measures “how the 200d SMA of the SSR moves within the Bollinger Bands BB(200, 2).” Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SSR Oscillator over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin SSR Oscillator has been close to the zero mark during the last couple of months, indicating the investor purchasing power is more or less neutral compared to the size of the BTC supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Upper Bound Is $117,000, Glassnode Says From the chart, it’s visible that the trend was different during the rally beyond $100,000 that occurred late last year. Back then, the SSR Oscillator took on a highly positive value, suggesting the stablecoin supply was low relative to BTC. The cryptocurrency is currently also trading around the same levels as then, yet the SSR is showing a different story. “Despite similar price levels, this shift suggests that investor purchasing power has improved markedly, reflecting stronger underlying demand conditions,” notes the report. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $109,500, up over 2% in the last seven days.

2025-07-04T06:44:24,"Crypto ETF BLOX, Which Offers Digital Asset Exposure and Options Income, Gains Steam","A recently launched crypto ETF in the U.S., which offers diversified exposure to digital assets along with options income, is gaining traction in a sign that investors are looking beyond traditional, single-spot-focused products. The Nicholas Crypto Income ETF (BLOX), an actively managed ETF designed for diversified exposure to the digital assets ecosystem while generating additional income via options strategies, went live on the NYSE on June 17. The ETF is the latest addition to the XFUNDS by Nicholas Wealth suite. Since then, the ETF has registered a net inflow of around $4.52 million, according to data source VettaFi. BLOX's website puts the total net assets at $4.9 million. ""The options income space is almost becoming its own asset class,"" David Nicholas, CEO of XFUNDs, told CoinDesk in an interview, adding that the fund is drawing interest from yield-hungry retail investors. Three-sleeved product The fund, launched in partnership with Tidal Investments LLC, comprises of an equity sleeve that invests in publicly listed shares of crypto-related firms and companies holding digital assets on their balance sheets. The second sleeve of the fund offers exposure to select bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds, with the flexibility to expand exposure to other digital assets through potential regulated vehicles. As of Thursday, the fund's top 10 holdings included names such as BlackRock's spot Ethereum ETF, Coinbase, Nvidia, MARA, Core Scientific, and others. The unique mix of holdings ensures that the performance isn't entirely dependent on bitcoin's (BTC) price. ""We own about 11 businesses, and we have high conviction that they will benefit from Bitcoin or Ether appreciation, but they aren't crypto assets themselves. So, you gain exposure to both cryptocurrency and publicly traded companies with earnings and growth. We think that combination inside the fund is pretty unique,"" Nicholas said. Finally, there is an options sleeve that generates income. The fund writes call/put spreads on the crypto sleeve while selectively writing covered calls or put spreads on its equity holdings. Writing an option is akin to selling insurance against bullish or bearish price moves in return for an upfront premium, which represents the income of the writer (seller). Writing put spreads against holdings allows the fund to collect premiums as the assets appreciate, providing additional income alongside the gains from the underlying holdings. BLOX trades options tied to the spot ETFs, including those linked to BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, IBIT. For instance, shares in Coinbase, one of the ETF's top 10 holdings, rose over 14% in the last week of June. The fund's three-sleeved structure means it likely captured the full rally alongside income through put spreads. The same can be said with respect to Core Scientific, which recently rose 15%. ""That’s what’s great about put spreads—there’s no cap. A put spread is a long, bullish options position,"" Nicholas said. The income from options and dividends on stock holdings is distributed to subscribers every week. Note that crypto holders have been writing put spreads and higher-strike calls on the offshore derivatives giant Deribit for some time. These yield-generation strategies are quite popular in the equity markets. Open to altcoin inclusion When asked about the growing interest in ETFs tied to major altcoins such as Solana's SOL (SOL), XRP (XRP) and others, Nicholas said they will accommodate the new ones as and when they become available. ""Once the SEC approves others—like Solana, which has a pending ETF—we can file an amendment and add them to our fund. So we wouldn’t need a new ETF. Since we see this as a broad crypto exposure fund, we’d just edit the existing structure to include new assets,"" Nicholas told CoinDesk.

The breakout attempt stalled just below $110,600, a level that aligns with key Fibonacci and supply resistance. While the broader structure remains bullish, intraday indicators are showing divergence and early signs of short-term exhaustion. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, Bitcoin price recently breached the descending triangle resistance near $108,000, which had capped upside since early June.

Traders are watching closely as Trump’s trade tariffs are expected soon, while fading hopes for rate cuts are adding pressure. With global tensions cooling and markets loving the optimism , Bitcoin and the broader crypto space are riding the wave. The U.S. is entering a big week for crypto as President Trump’s major bill is set to be signed on July 4, and lawmakers will launch “ Crypto Week ” from July 14–18. During this time, three major bills, the CLARITY Act, Anti-CBDC Act, and GENIUS Act, will be discussed. These could bring clear rules, block government-backed digital surveillance, and support crypto innovation. If passed, they might kickstart the next bull run. NEW: Chairman @RepFrenchHill , @HouseAgGOP Chairman @CongressmanGT , and House Leadership announced that the week of July 14th will be “Crypto Week,” where the CLARITY Act, Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and GENIUS Act will be considered. @SpeakerJohnson @SteveScalise … pic.twitter.com/vIUoGaoSy1 — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) July 3, 2025 Bitcoin soared to $109,112 this week, just shy of its all-time high. Trump’s bullish moves have given new hope within the crypto community. Crypto eyes are locked on these 3 major crypto bills this week that could decide whether the momentum continues or fizzles out. GENIUS Act to Lead the Way Leading the agenda is the GENIUS Act , a bill that recently cleared the Senate and is poised to pass in the House. This legislation focuses on bringing stablecoins into the traditional financial system. While it has drawn criticism for favoring fiat structures over DeFi ideals, it has also prompted companies like Tether to ramp up investments in Treasury bonds. The bill is widely viewed as a cornerstone of Trump’s vision to boost the dollar’s dominance through stablecoins. The CLARITY Act will Open Doors for Transparency in the System The CLARITY Act is also gaining traction, aiming to end the long-standing confusion over whether crypto assets should be treated as securities or commodities. While the bill remains under committee review, “Crypto Week” is expected to amplify support for its consumer protection and token classification framework. However, it has faced some pushback, with former CFTC Chair Tom Massad expressing concerns about the bill’s flexible language and regulatory ambiguity. [post_titles_links postid=”478131″] Anti-CBDC Act: Less Urgent, But Politically Symbolic Rounding out the trio is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Though it hasn’t seen movement in recent months, Republicans are still backing it strongly as a preventative measure against a government-issued central bank digital currency. The bill would essentially block the Fed from issuing a CBDC, aligning with Trump’s clear anti-CBDC stance. However, the proposal doesn’t affect citizens using foreign CBDCs, making its practical impact limited for now. Congressional Crypto Push Gets Real With Republicans pushing forward on these bills, “Crypto Week” marks a historic moment for US crypto legislation. While the GENIUS Act seems set to pass, the other two bills may gain momentum from the increased attention. The week may also reveal how deep the divide is between pro-crypto innovation and concerns about regulation and control.

This initiative, spearheaded by House Republicans, aims to advance President Trump’s digital assets agenda and establish clear regulatory frameworks for the crypto industry. What is the GENIUS Act, and how could it impact the crypto market? The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act) has cleared the Senate and is expected to pass in the House. It aims to integrate stablecoins into the traditional financial system, potentially boosting the dollar’s dominance through regulated stablecoins. This could bring significant institutional investment and foster market growth. How could the passage of these crypto bills impact Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum? The passage of these bills, particularly the GENIUS Act providing regulatory clarity for stablecoins, could significantly bolster Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum.

2025-07-04T06:30:31,"Bitcoin options worth $3B to expire on July 4 — will BTC retrace?","Bitcoin may see a spike in short-term price swings as nearly $3 billion worth of options contracts approach expiration on July 4. According to data from Deribit, the leading crypto options exchange, these contracts are set to expire at 08:00 UTC, with the “max pain” price currently pegged at $106,000. This price level reflects the point where most options, both calls and puts, expire with little to no value, often resulting in the least payout to traders and the highest benefit to sellers. When expiry nears, price action sometimes moves toward this level, especially when it’s within reach. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at $109,044 as of press time, up 0.2% from the previous day. The market momentum may be slowing, as shown by a 21% drop in trading volume to $28.9 billion over the past day. Lower volume around an expiry event can increase sensitivity to sudden price moves as traders adjust their positions. You might also like: Bitcoin price outlook: Long-term $120k trendline test could define Q3 The put-to-call ratio for this expiry is 1.05, indicating a fairly balanced scenario between bullish and bearish bets. Although it doesn’t point strongly in either direction, this even split and Bitcoin staying above the maximum pain level suggest some downside risk as contracts settle and traders unwind. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin continues to hold within an upward trend. It’s still above its 20-day and 10-day moving averages, which act as short-term dynamic support. BTC is also trading near the top of its Bollinger Bands, often a sign of buying strength, but also an area where rallies can lose steam if new buyers don’t step in. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The MACD is in positive territory, indicating some underlying strength, even though momentum indicators are beginning to show signs of exhaustion. If Bitcoin drops below $107,500, it might move toward the $106,000 mark, a critical support zone that aligns with the maximum pain target and recent technical lows. However, if the price stays above $108,000 and breaks through $110,000 on increasing volume, it might indicate renewed bullish momentum and pave the way for another retest of the all-time high above $111,000.

With this move, Lummis has brought the crypto-friendly regulations he has been advocating for a long time back to the Congressional agenda. The Republican senator’s new bill is almost identical to provisions President Donald Trump tried to include in his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” reconciliation package earlier in the week, but those provisions were not included in the package and were not put to a vote during the vote. Related News: Pantera Capital and Unexpected Altcoin Announce New Joint Investment of $250 Million “We cannot allow outdated tax policies to stifle American innovation,” Lummis said in a statement. “This bill ensures that our citizens can participate in the digital economy without accidentally committing tax violations.” He also invited public comments on the bill, saying he aims to “get it to the President’s desk.” The highlights of the new bill include ending double taxation of mining and staking activities and exempting digital asset transactions of up to $300 from tax.

The June Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report showed a gain of 147,000 jobs, above the forecasted 111,000. However, markets viewed it as a mixed bag; wage growth slowed to 0.2%, unemployment ticked up to 4.1%, and ISM Services PMI barely stayed above expansion at 50.8. https://twitter.com/CEA47/status/1940761777408712763 Despite stronger factory orders at 8.2%, concerns about labour softness and Fed independence (after Trump’s Powell comments) continue to cap any significant rebound in the dollar. That’s helped Bitcoin stay afloat as an alternative asset, even if risk appetite remains tempered. With markets still pricing in at least one Fed rate cut before year-end, the environment remains broadly supportive of crypto, especially if inflation readings continue to cool. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Higher Lows Hold, but MACD Weakens The Bitcoin price prediction remains bulli sh, as BTC has been respecting an ascending trendline since the June 21 low, consistently making higher lows on the 2-hour chart. That trend remains intact for now, with support seen around $108,371, where the 50-day EMA meets the trendline —a critical technical confluence. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview But momentum is showing early signs of fatigue: The MACD histogram has turned red Signal lines are curling down, but no confirmed bearish crossover yet Recent candles near $110,413 resistance are small-bodied, showing indecision and waning buyer strength If the price holds this zone and prints a reversal candle, such as a hammer or bullish engulfing, bulls could regain control, targeting $110,400 and $112,041. However, a close below $108,300 may open the door for a sharper decline to $107,325 and $105,368, with broader trendline support near $103,748 offering the next significant cushion. Bitcoin Trade Setup: Trendline Bounce or Breakdown? This setup is classic for traders watching structural support: Buy Scenario: Look for bullish candlestick confirmation above $108,300 Target Levels: $110,400 and $112,041 Bearish Breakdown: Close below $108,300 could push toward $107,300 and $105,000 Indicators to Watch: MACD crossover, EMA slope, volume spike From my experience, trendline support like this doesn’t give way quietly. If bulls show up here, we may see a strong rotation higher. But if they don’t, risk increases for a technical shakeout that could catch over-leveraged long positions off guard. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.88M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has surpassed $1.74 million in its public presale, with $1,883,062 raised out of a $2,373,526 target.

RealToken LLC uses blockchain technology to tokenize real estate and sell fractional ownership to investors. However, what city officials describe as widespread neglect of housing standards has prompted Detroit to pursue legal action, alleging that the firm failed to meet basic health and safety obligations as a landlord According to the complaint filed in Wayne County Circuit Court, the defendants, named as RealToken LLC, co-founders Remy and Jean-Marc Jacobson, and 165 affiliated corporate entities, allowed hundreds of properties to deteriorate. City inspectors from the Buildings, Safety Engineering, and Environmental Department documented ongoing violations across the properties, including structural damage, rodent infestations, mold growth, sewage backups, and illegal utility connections. Of these, 53 were deemed to pose an immediate threat to tenant health and safety. City officials say RealToken used a network of limited liability companies, many registered as shell entities, to obscure true ownership and avoid accountability, leaving tenants to endure unsafe living conditions. You might also like: Ondo Finance, Pantera Capital to invest $250M in RWA tokenization Detroit is asking the court to mandate urgent repairs, establish rent escrow accounts, and hold the Jacobson brothers personally liable for allegedly refusing to fund necessary maintenance through former property management companies. RealToken launched in 2019 as a real estate tokenization platform on Ethereum and later migrated to Gnosis Chain. It allows investors to purchase shares in rental properties via cryptocurrency from any corner of the globe, with its whitepaper claiming the model lowers investment barriers and increases transparency in traditionally illiquid markets. Critics, however, argue that the fractional ownership model used by RealToken has led to vacancies because properties are often acquired as investment assets rather than maintained as active rental homes. With ownership divided among numerous investors, many of whom are not locally involved, there is little incentive or clear responsibility to ensure properties remain habitable or occupied. As a result, many homes have been left empty, deteriorating over time, and contributing to neighborhood decline. “This is the largest nuisance abatement case in our history,” said Corporation Counsel Conrad Mallett, adding that innovation does not exempt firms from fulfilling legal responsibilities. Global interest in tokenized real estate is rising, with Deloitte projecting the market to grow to $4 trillion by 2035. The tokenization model is gaining traction as blockchain platforms make real estate more accessible through fractional ownership, thereby lowering capital requirements while also improving market liquidity.

After hitting a 24-hour high of $110,117, Bitcoin now trades at $109,386, reflecting a 1.8% increase in the past day. This recent push places the asset about $2,000 surge away from its all-time high of $111,814, recorded in May 2025, prompting renewed attention from traders and analysts. While price movements often attract headlines, on-chain data has started signaling deeper market activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising Binance Sees 3,400 Bitcoin in Outflows as Spot Volume Surges According to CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, a substantial volume of BTC has recently been moved off Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. The shift aligns with anticipation around a series of US macroeconomic indicators, which historically tend to influence risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Taha highlighted that Binance recorded a net outflow of over 3,400 BTC in a single day. This occurred shortly after Bitcoin’s price breached the $109,000 mark. Large-scale withdrawals from exchanges such as Binance are often interpreted as a sign that holders may be preparing to hold their assets longer-term, or shielding their positions from potential short-term volatility. Simultaneously, Binance’s share of the global Bitcoin spot volume surged significantly, from 41% to 56% in just one session. Taha noted that this spike indicates increased reliance on Binance’s liquidity by traders seeking exposure to Bitcoin ahead of anticipated market-moving economic data. The outflow trend, paired with rising spot volume, suggests that traders are actively responding to broader market signals, especially from traditional finance. US Jobs Report Drives Market Positioning The current surge in Bitcoin activity coincides with heightened market focus on US labor market data, including the Non-Farm Employment Change, Unemployment Rate, and Average Hourly Earnings figures. These indicators are closely watched by investors as they influence inflation expectations and the Federal Reserve’s approach to interest rate adjustments. Shifts in rate expectations often have direct consequences for risk assets like Bitcoin, as changes in the cost of capital affect liquidity and investor appetite. Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Taha suggests that the recent Binance outflows may reflect investor positioning ahead of potential macro-driven market volatility. “Bitcoin outflows from Binance alongside the sharp rise in spot trading activity… appear to show that investors are positioning for potential upside volatility,” he wrote. A favorable labor report could amplify bullish sentiment across both equity and crypto markets if it strengthens expectations of a rate cut or an extended pause in rate hikes.

2025-07-04T05:50:27,"Tether USDT: Massive 1 Billion Minting Sparks Crucial Market Shift","BitcoinWorld Tether USDT: Massive 1 Billion Minting Sparks Crucial Market Shift The cryptocurrency world is abuzz once again, this time with a significant development reported by the vigilant eyes of Whale Alert. A staggering 1 billion Tether USDT has been minted at the Tether Treasury. This isn’t just a number; it’s a colossal injection of capital into the digital asset ecosystem, potentially signaling a pivotal shift in market dynamics. For anyone invested in or observing the crypto space, understanding the implications of such a massive USDT minting event is absolutely crucial. Tether USDT: What Does This Massive Minting Truly Signify? Tether USDT stands as the undisputed titan among stablecoins, a digital asset designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. Its primary function is to provide liquidity and a safe haven for traders within the volatile cryptocurrency markets, allowing them to move in and out of positions without converting back to traditional fiat currency. The minting of 1 billion new USDT tokens by Tether Treasury, as flagged by Whale Alert, represents a substantial expansion of its circulating stablecoin supply . This isn’t a random occurrence; Tether mints new tokens primarily in response to increased demand from institutional and retail investors looking to acquire more stablecoins for various purposes, including: On-ramping Capital: New investors or large funds entering the crypto market often use USDT as their initial gateway. Arbitrage Opportunities: Traders use USDT to exploit price differences across various exchanges. Hedging Against Volatility: During market downturns, traders often convert volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum into stablecoins like USDT to preserve capital. Decoding USDT Minting: Why the Sudden Surge in Stablecoin Supply? When we talk about USDT minting , it’s important to clarify that this isn’t like a central bank printing physical money. Instead, it refers to the digital creation of new tokens on a blockchain, backed by an equivalent amount of reserves held by Tether. This recent 1 billion USDT issuance suggests a significant demand for stablecoins in the market. Several factors could be driving this surge: Institutional Inflow: Large institutions or ‘whales’ might be preparing to deploy significant capital into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. Minting new USDT is often the first step in this process. Market Anticipation: There might be a collective expectation of future market movements, prompting traders to accumulate stablecoins for quick deployment. Exchange Demand: Crypto exchanges might be requesting more USDT to meet the liquidity needs of their users, especially for high-volume trading pairs like BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT. The consistent growth in stablecoin supply , particularly from Tether, underscores its integral role in facilitating transactions and providing a stable anchor in the fast-paced crypto landscape. How Does This Impact Crypto Market Liquidity and Beyond? The immediate and most direct consequence of a massive USDT minting event is its effect on crypto market liquidity . Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. A larger supply of USDT means: Increased Buying Power: More USDT available translates to more capital ready to be deployed into other cryptocurrencies, potentially driving up prices. Smoother Transactions: High liquidity reduces slippage, meaning large orders can be filled without significantly moving the market price against the trader. Enhanced Trading Opportunities: With abundant stablecoin supply, traders have more flexibility to execute complex strategies and capitalize on market movements. Historically, significant USDT mints have often preceded upward movements in Bitcoin and altcoin prices, as the newly minted stablecoins are eventually used to purchase other digital assets. While correlation does not always imply causation, the pattern is frequently observed and closely monitored by market participants. This influx of capital can be a powerful catalyst for broader market activity. Whale Alert’s Role: Shedding Light on On-Chain Movements The initial report of this 1 billion USDT minting came from Whale Alert , a popular blockchain tracking service. Whale Alert plays a vital role in the crypto ecosystem by monitoring and reporting large transactions across various blockchains. Their automated alerts provide real-time transparency into the movements of significant amounts of cryptocurrency, including stablecoin minting and burning events. This transparency is crucial for several reasons: Market Insight: It allows traders and analysts to gain immediate insight into potential market shifts and liquidity changes. Accountability: By publicly tracking Tether’s minting activities, Whale Alert contributes to greater accountability from stablecoin issuers regarding their supply and reserves. Community Awareness: It keeps the broader crypto community informed about major on-chain events that could influence asset prices and market sentiment. Without services like Whale Alert, such significant events might go unnoticed by the wider public, hindering informed decision-making within the decentralized financial landscape. Navigating the Waters: Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights The minting of 1 billion Tether USDT , while largely seen as a positive indicator for potential market activity and increased crypto market liquidity , also comes with its own set of considerations and challenges. Benefits: Market Stability: USDT provides a crucial stable peg in a volatile market, allowing for easier entry and exit points. Global Accessibility: Facilitates cross-border transactions and remittances with lower fees and faster speeds than traditional banking. Foundation for DeFi: A large stablecoin supply is essential for the growth and functionality of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, providing reliable collateral and trading pairs. Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Tether, like other stablecoin issuers, faces ongoing regulatory pressure regarding the transparency and auditing of its reserves. Centralization Concerns: While USDT operates on decentralized blockchains, its issuance is centralized, leading to debates about control and potential single points of failure. Market Manipulation Fears: Critics sometimes raise concerns that large mints could be used to artificially inflate market prices, though no definitive proof has ever been established. Actionable Insights: For investors and enthusiasts, this event offers a few key takeaways: Stay Informed: Monitor Whale Alert and other on-chain analytics to track significant movements. Understand the Context: Don’t just react to a minting event; consider the broader market sentiment, economic indicators, and regulatory landscape. Risk Management: While increased liquidity can signal potential upside, always practice sound risk management and diversify your portfolio. In conclusion, the minting of 1 billion Tether USDT is more than just a transaction; it’s a significant event that reflects the ongoing expansion and evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights Tether’s central role in providing liquidity and underscores the growing demand for stablecoins as essential tools for navigating the digital asset space. While the immediate impact often points towards increased buying pressure and enhanced crypto market liquidity , it also serves as a reminder of the need for transparency and informed decision-making in this rapidly evolving financial frontier. The watchful eyes of services like Whale Alert ensure that such crucial movements do not go unnoticed, empowering the community with valuable real-time data.

2025-07-04T05:44:07,"Tom Lee’s Bullish Ethereum Bet Sends Bitmine Stock Surging 3,000%","Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is “the most bullish thing to happen to Ethereum this year,” opined Ryan Sean Adams, co-founder of Bankless, on Friday. Bitcoin bull Lee has made some famous predictions about BTC, stating on CNBC in 2017 that it would reach $55,000 when it was trading around $2,000 at the time. This was at the time when JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon said he would fire any trader who touched Bitcoin, and billionaire Warren Buffett called it “rat poisoned squared,” observed Adams. Bitmine Stock to The Moon Earlier this week, Lee launched a $250 million Ethereum treasury for his company Bitmine. He has effectively become for Ethereum what Michael Saylor is for Bitcoin. He also went on CNBC and said Ethereum is the next Bitcoin, stablecoins are crypto’s ChatGPT moment, and they make ETH more valuable. “Underneath the stablecoin industry is Ethereum – that is really the backbone and architecture of stablecoins, so it’s important to create a project that accumulates Ethereum to essentially protect and have some influence on the network.” The market has already reacted with Bitmine Immersion Technologies stock (BNMR) surging a whopping 2,934% since the announcement, according to Google Finance. The share price topped $140 on Thursday, surging from last week’s closing price of $4.27. Source: Google Finance Adams concluded that this is the best thing to happen to Ethereum this year. “You think Wall Street isn’t listening this time? Get ready for FOMO season. ETH is going up,” he said. Let me tell you why Tom Lee is the most bullish thing to happen to ETH this year. Tom Lee was the guy in 2017 on CNBC calling for $55k bitcoin when it was trading at $2k. Wall street people thought he was insane. I remember the segments. The anchors would smile and be like… pic.twitter.com/HIkqRVyZ54 — RYAN SΞAN ADAMS – rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) July 3, 2025 Meanwhile, DCinvestor admitted to his 265,000 X followers that he did not like Ethereum, but added: “I have to concede that trillions of dollars in stablecoins coming onchain and every financial institution in the world building on it could indeed be bullish for ETH,” Analysts and experts are anticipating big moves for ETH prices if the corporate treasury trend continues. Joseph Lubin’s gaming firm, SharpLink, has also raised $425 million to stack and stake Ethereum. SharpLink Gaming will ring the Nasdaq closing bell on July 7 to celebrate its Ethereum treasury milestone, the firm announced on Thursday. “We believe Ethereum is integral to the next wave of financial innovation,” stated Joseph Lubin. ETH Prices Still Sideways Nevertheless, Ethereum prices are still sideways, with many observers pointing out that it is trading like a stablecoin for lack of movement. The asset reclaimed $2,600 during late trading on Thursday but couldn’t hold above that level and retreated slightly on Friday morning. Analyst ‘Merlijn The Trader’ observed that Ethereum had “just nailed the retest” and “bounced perfectly off the breakout zone.” “This is where the next wave starts,” he predicted. ETH still needs to reclaim and hold the $2,800 level before any further momentum can be measured.

2025-07-04T05:41:36,"FTX Repayment Blocked in 49 Regions Due to Crypto Restrictions","The post FTX Repayment Blocked in 49 Regions Due to Crypto Restrictions appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The FTX Recovery Trust has officially frozen creditor payouts in 49 jurisdictions where crypto activity is restricted or banned, citing the need for legal confirmation before proceeding. The move was disclosed in a July 2 court filing and primarily affects regions such as China, Nigeria, Fiji, Andorra, and Zimbabwe. While these jurisdictions account for only 5% of total allowed claims, a staggering 82% of the frozen value originates from China alone. Due to local laws in these regions, FTX is facing regulatory uncertainty over whether it can legally distribute funds to residents. What Happens If Users Are From These Jurisdictions? FTX has implemented a “hold-and-review” system where all claims from restricted countries are now classified as “disputed.” The Recovery Trust will only process these claims if legal advice confirms that distributions won’t violate local laws. Until then, no funds will be released to these users. Once the court signs off on the process, each impacted creditor will receive a “Restricted Jurisdiction Notice.” This document will detail why the creditor is affected and give them a deadline, at least 45 days, to object. FTX: Restricted countries Disputed claims 49 Jurisdictions -5% allowed claims in restricted countries 82% of value in China Due to local laws that 1) crypto currency trading is not permitted or 2) distributors not allowed pic.twitter.com/wCEfAOFyaD — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) July 3, 2025 The situation has sparked debate among creditors, with some pointing out that users who have moved to crypto-friendly countries are still unable to access their claims. FTX Creditor advocate Sunil Kavuri said it might be possible to transfer or sell claims to entities in allowed jurisdictions, though it’s unclear if this is a guaranteed fix. Creditors Retaliate In response to FTX, Chinese FTX creditor Will的折腾纪 (@zhetengji) announced that he’s taking legal action after FTX froze payouts to users in countries like China. He’s already contacted his New York lawyer and plans to object at every stage. Will says the move is unfair because, even though crypto trading is restricted in China, people are still allowed to hold crypto and U.S. dollars overseas. Since FTX is settling claims in USD, he questions why wire transfers aren’t allowed. He’s urging other affected users not to stay silent and to join him in challenging the decision. Disputed Claims Shrinking In a positive update, FTX also updated its numbers, revealing that the total amount of disputed claims has dropped from $6.5 billion to $4.6 billion. Around $1.8 billion in previously disputed claims have been approved, and another $2.7 billion is expected to be allowed soon. So far, the total value of approved claims has reached $8.3 billion, offering some relief to creditors waiting for clarity. Until resolved, all affected claims will remain disputed, leaving billions of dollars hanging in legal limbo.

July 4, 2025 08:18:05 UTC Solo Bitcoin Miner Defies Odds, Earns $350K Reward with Small Setup A solo Bitcoin miner recently earned nearly $350,000 by solving an entire block using a small setup with just 2.3 petahashes of power. The block was solved via the CKpool solo mining pool, earning the miner 3.173 BTC.

July 4, 2025 08:08:51 UTC Chainlink Whales Accumulate 85M LINK, But Price Stalls Below $15 LINK is trading in a tight $12–$15 range as whales continue to quietly accumulate, while retail traders remain mostly inactive. According to a CryptoQuant analyst, wallets holding 100,000 to 1 million LINK have amassed over 85 million tokens, the highest since late 2022. Despite this, price action remains flat. Exchange reserves have also fallen nearly 40% year-to-date. Analysts suggest that a breakout will require renewed retail interest or a slowdown in whale accumulation. Without it, LINK risks dropping toward $10.
