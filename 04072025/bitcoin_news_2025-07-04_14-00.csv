2025-07-04T11:51:24,"Solana Price Prediction Experts Now Eyeing Bitcoin Solaris as the Faster Route to Bitcoin-Level Wealth","For years, Solana held its position as the rising star of blockchain speed. But as experts project a slight dip in SOL’s price by July 2025, the spotlight has started to shift. The new name echoing across forums, trading groups, and even TikTok isn’t another Ethereum clone or meme coin. It’s Bitcoin Solaris, and it’s being pitched as the serious contender for those who missed out on early Bitcoin riches. This isn’t just a token play. It’s a full-on blockchain overhaul that’s making wealth generation mobile, fast, and ridiculously accessible. So what’s making SOL bulls glance sideways at BTC-S? The answers are both technical and economic, and they’re worth your full attention. Solana Holds Strong, But the Fire’s Moving Elsewhere Let’s be clear: Solana isn’t going anywhere. With its high throughput and low fees, it remains one of the most efficient networks in the space. It’s fast, it’s battle-tested, and it continues to power countless DeFi and NFT projects. However, recent predictions forecasting a small decline in SOL’s price have traders exploring alternative paths to serious upside. That curiosity is now pointing directly toward Bitcoin Solaris. While Solana thrives on speed, Bitcoin Solaris combines speed with accessibility, wealth-building tools, and a Bitcoin-style scarcity model. The comparison is no longer about performance alone. It’s about who can help everyday users actually get rich, and BTC-S is making a very strong case. What Is Bitcoin Solaris and Why Is Everyone Suddenly Talking About It? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is a dual-layer blockchain platform that aims to combine the best of Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s performance, and then take it further. It’s not a fork. It’s a complete reimagining of what crypto wealth could look like if you didn’t need to buy expensive hardware or study Solidity just to participate. At its core: It’s powered by a hybrid Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake model It can process up to 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality It consumes 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin It’s built to be mined by anyone through the upcoming Solaris Nova app And it’s preparing to launch its own native blockchain after a short Solana-based rollout That last part is key. You can mine BTC-S from your phone. Literally. Whether you’ve got an Android or an old MacBook, the upcoming Solaris Nova App will let you earn tokens directly from your device. This kind of mobile-first mining is no gimmick. It’s backed by adaptive algorithms that balance energy use and power output, and yes, it works. In fact, you can test how much you’d earn using their mining tool at this calculator . Inside the Engine: Why This Tech Could Actually Outpace Bitcoin Under the hood, Bitcoin Solaris is doing things differently: Dual-Layer Architecture: A secure base layer (PoW) and a lightning-fast application layer (DPoS) Validator Rotation: Ensures decentralization and prevents network abuse Rust-Based Smart Contracts: Enabling real-world apps from DeFi to healthcare Up to 100,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer using dynamic block sizes Full cross-chain capability, with bridges in development to move assets across ecosystems Zero-Knowledge Proofs and long-range attack mitigation for top-tier security Not Just Crypto Evolution: This Is Financial Liberation If this all sounds intense, that’s because it is. But for those diving into the documentation, it becomes clear: Bitcoin Solaris is not just another whitepaper dream. It’s already hit milestones like successful testnet launches, a growing ecosystem, and over 13,650 presale participants. The entire infrastructure has been independently verified as well. Security audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins confirm the system’s robustness. Why the Presale Is Breaking All the Rules While some projects spend six months in presale limbo, Bitcoin Solaris is executing one of the most aggressive launches in the space. Phase 10 is currently live, with the price at $10, climbing to $11 in the next phase and aiming for a $20 launch. That’s a projected 150% return if you get in before July 31, 2025. Here’s what’s adding fuel to the fire: Over $6 million raised already More than 13,650 unique users onboarded Only about four weeks left until the presale ends Considered one of the shortest, most explosive presales of the year To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask for smooth delivery. And if you’re looking to stack even more tokens, the referral program is wild. It gives both you and your invitee a 5% reward. You can learn all about it here . The Hype Is Real, And It’s Spreading Fast From Telegram threads to YouTube breakdowns, influencers and crypto enthusiasts are digging into Bitcoin Solaris like it’s the next Ethereum. A recent detailed review by Crypto Show explained why the project’s speed, mining flexibility, and tight scarcity design are catching fire. Meanwhile, community chatter on Telegram and on X is showing no signs of slowing down. It’s a rare moment when the tech, narrative, and presale numbers all align, and BTC-S seems to be right in that zone. To see why some are calling it the “faster route to Bitcoin-level wealth,” check out their ecosystem and presale info directly at Bitcoin Solaris . You’ll also find insights on how to prepare for the upcoming Solaris Nova App launch. Final Verdict: Blink and You’ll Miss It Solana might still hold court among the top-tier chains, but if you’re chasing life-changing upside, Bitcoin Solaris is the one to watch. With real mining from your phone, verified infrastructure, and a community-first rollout, it offers a faster, more open road to serious crypto gains. This isn’t about ditching Solana. It’s about recognizing the moment when the wealth engine starts warming up somewhere new. And for now, all signs point toward Bitcoin Solaris.

2025-07-04T11:51:18,"Chainlink Investors Diversify: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Promises Bitcoin-Level Returns with 10,000 TPS Technology","The post Chainlink Investors Diversify: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Promises Bitcoin-Level Returns with 10,000 TPS Technology appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a world where crypto veterans have learned that the early bird doesn’t just get the worm but sometimes the Lambo too, a new headline is starting to circulate: “Chainlink holders are diversifying.” And no, it’s not out of boredom. It’s because Bitcoin Solaris has entered the scene, and it is not just another altcoin promising the moon. It is a meticulously engineered system that blends Bitcoin’s foundational ethos with a modern DeFi-ready infrastructure. At the core of it all? An architecture that’s geared for growth, speed, and massive profit potential. Chainlink Is Solid, But It’s Not the Whole Picture Chainlink has carved out its role as the middleware of crypto, bringing real-world data to smart contracts. That’s useful. That’s valuable. But for the average investor looking for the kind of life-changing upside that Bitcoin provided in its early days, LINK’s potential growth is more evolutionary than explosive. It’s already established, widely integrated, and its price often moves at the speed of news headlines. Investors seeking bigger upside are now starting to hedge. And Bitcoin Solaris is where that spotlight is shifting. The Bitcoin Solaris Formula: 10,000 TPS Meets Mobile Wealth Creation What’s attracting thousands to Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just hype. It’s tech. BTC-S introduces a dual-layer system with a hybrid consensus model that combines Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This combo keeps things decentralized and secure while enabling lightning-fast transaction speeds. The specs say it all: Base Layer (PoW): 3,000 TPS Solaris Layer (DPoS): 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality Validator rotation every 24 hours with strict slashing conditions Rust-based smart contracts optimized for cross-chain dApps Unlike Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time, Bitcoin Solaris closes blocks every 15 seconds on the Solaris Layer, ensuring scalability and usability for real-world applications. This Isn’t a Trend, It’s the Start of a Blockchain Evolution Add to that the fact that its upcoming mobile app, the Solaris Nova App, allows users to mine BTC-S with no complex hardware setup. This is the part that makes people perk up. Through the exciting release of the app, anyone with a smartphone becomes a miner. No need to manage rigs, just real rewards from real participation. And to estimate potential profits, users are already playing with the mining calculator . Why the Presale Is Heating Up Bitcoin Solaris is in phase 10 of its presale, and things are moving fast. The current price is $10. Next stop? $11, and a launch at $20. That’s a potential 150% gain from now to day one trading. More than 13,650 users have joined so far. And with only about four weeks remaining, this may go down as one of the shortest, most explosive presales of the year. Even wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are officially recommended for receiving BTC-S on launch day, making onboarding seamless. This kind of growth doesn’t go unnoticed. A detailed review by Token Galaxy breaks down why so many enthusiasts believe this is the next breakout coin. And yes, the numbers speak for themselves: Over $6 million raised Rapid community expansion Audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins Live discussion happening in the official Telegram and X account A Blueprint Built for Generational Wealth Here’s the bigger picture: Bitcoin Solaris is not just about TPS and token price. It’s about ecosystem readiness. Developers can already build DeFi, NFT, gaming, supply chain, and IoT dApps using Rust contracts on a high-speed, low-fee chain. That opens the door for: Carbon credit trading and sustainability markets Healthcare apps for secure patient data Blockchain-based education credentials Real estate tokenization and smart rentals But it’s the wealth-building mechanisms that are catching attention. The network uses a hybrid mining model, distributing 40% of rewards to Base Layer miners and 25% to Solaris Layer validators. This ensures long-term sustainability and allows daily participants to earn directly from the activity. In other words, Bitcoin Solaris is the first major project since early Bitcoin to put meaningful mining power in your pocket without any technical friction. BTC-S vs LINK: A Different Kind of Upside While Chainlink remains a key infrastructure player in crypto, its token’s role is primarily functional. Bitcoin Solaris, by contrast, is offering a network that not only fuels infrastructure but also makes it accessible, mineable, and profitable at the user level. Feature Chainlink (LINK) Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) Consensus Mechanism None (uses ETH validators) Hybrid PoW + DPoS TPS Performance Relies on the host chain Up to 100,000 TPS Native Mining No Yes, via the upcoming mobile app Early-Stage ROI Moderate High potential (150% presale return) Smart Contract Focus Oracle layer only Full dApp support (Rust-based) Network Architecture Single layer, external node Dual-layer, internal validator sync It’s clear that Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just build utility, it builds opportunity. Final Thoughts Chainlink’s investors know how to spot value. And right now, many are quietly diversifying into Bitcoin Solaris. The reasons are obvious. The project isn’t just fast and efficient, it’s early, accessible, and designed to replicate the kind of massive upside that Bitcoin offered in its infancy.

2025-07-04T11:45:02,"Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Will ‘Leave People in Awe’ Once BTC Breaks Out, Outlines Path Forward for XRP","A crypto strategist known for making timely Bitcoin calls believes that BTC will print an astronomical new all-time high before the current cycle is over. Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 468,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is likely on the verge of an explosive breakout from its trading range. “The bid on BTC is relentless. When this thing finally breaks out of this range it will leave people in awe.” Next up, the analyst responds to crypto investor TraderJB’s comment on X that Bitcoin’s fifth wave may extend nearly 4.236 times the net travel of waves one through three based on historical precedence, which would put BTC at a cycle peak at around $264,000. Credible Crypto uses Elliott Wave theory, which depicts price movement in a series of waves based on crowd psychology. Under the theory, price impulses to the upside happen in five main waves, and according to the trader, BTC is in the midst of its fifth and final wave. “Two times may just be a coincidence, but it’s worth noting that the expected target, if it happens a third time, does fall within the range that I’ve been talking about for years now for the end of this final fifth wave (above $100,000, below $300,000). We have a significant amount of PA (price action) to develop to the upside before we can get a better estimate of where the final push may land but keeping this in the back of my mind.” Source: Credible Crypto/X Bitcoin is trading for $109,819 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the analyst says Ethereum ( ETH ) may surge to around $3,400 if BTC breaks out. “If this plays out on BTC would be looking for something similar on ETH. One more month of chop, then full send?” Source: Credible Crypto/X ETH is trading for $2,594 at time of writing, flat on the day. Lastly, the analyst predicts that payments blockchain token XRP may hit about $18 this cycle, after buying the digital asset for $0.18 in 2019. “I do expect [XRP] to be up over 100x. Taking a bit longer than expected, but you won’t see me complaining about a 100x ‘taking too long.'” The analyst suggests that XRP first needs to break through a key resistance level against BTC (XRP/BTC) at 0.00002162 BTC ($2.36) to hit his double-digit price target. Source: Credible Crypto/X XRP/BTC is trading for 0.00002063 BTC ($2.26) at time of writing.

2025-07-04T11:30:12,"Analyst Says Sell XRP Now Before 72% Price Crash To $0.6","XRP remains one of the most actively discussed cryptocurrencies on social media, with expectations that its price has yet to plateau. Things like the Ripple battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) coming to an end and Bitcoin expected to resume its uptrend have fueled expectations of the XRP price reaching new all-time highs. However, amid the calls for higher prices, a crypto analyst has warned that a major crash could be on the horizon for the altcoin. Why The XRP Price Will Crash Crypto analyst Xanrox took to the TradingView website to share thoughts on why they believe the XRP price is headed for a massive crash. The analyst explains that after the 600% rally that brought XRP to new 5-year peaks, it has lost steam and could be headed downward. The first thing is the fact that the price has been ranging for years , and even with the price jump back in 2024, Xanrox does not believe that the ranging has ended. This range began in 2017 and even after breaking above $3 briefly, the price remains inside of an ascending triangle, which is bearish at the current level. There is also the fact that the analyst points out that the pump created a large Fair Value Gap (FVG). The thing about FVGs is that they tend to be filled, especially after the price has ranged for as long as XRP has, and unfortunately, the FVG lies towards lower levels. The crypto analyst also calls out the fact that the XRP price is known for making weird moves and taking liquidity from traders while ranging. Historically, XRP has had more down periods than up , suggesting that bears often dominate the cryptocurrency. How Low Can The Price Go? The crypto analyst believes that the XRP price has already topped out, and thus, it’s time for investors to start thinking about exiting their positions. For one, even at $2.1, Xanrox says the price is still extremely high, especially sitting at the top of an ascending triangle. From here, they expect that the price will crash back down toward $0.6 , which is where the price started before the 600% increase in 2024, suggesting a 72% decrease in price. For investors who bought into the coin before the rally , the analyst advises that they start thinking about locking in profits at this level. For those who bought after the pump, they speculate that they got in at the top and should be looking to get out at breakeven or even eat a small loss to exit the position. Last but not least, for futures traders, the crypto analyst advises exiting any positions entered before the crash and switching to short positions if they want to make money on XRP.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/sell-xrp-72-price-crash-0-6/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|crypto|crypto news|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

A July 4 report from Matrixport suggests that if seasonal trends continue and capital flows stay consistent, Bitcoin ( BTC ) could reach $120,000 this month. According to the report, realized price swings have now reached multi-year lows, indicating a significant decline in volatility. The market may be maturing as the one-week implied volatility is in the 30s, which is calm by Bitcoin’s standards. Institutions are taking notice of this decreased volatility. When price movements are predictable, many large investors who were previously cautious due to risk controls are more likely to participate. Since April, almost $14 billion has poured into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which is about $4 billion more than the price action alone would imply. Matrixport analysts say this suggests strong long-term demand rather than short-term trading. You might also like: $1B in Bitcoin moves from Satoshi-era wallet after 14 years of inactivity However, not everything is working in Bitcoin’s favor. Crypto market inflows are generally slowing down. Inflows are expected to be around $291 billion in 2025 at the current rate, which is significantly less than the $377 billion in 2024. With a multiplier effect of 2x to 2.5x for every dollar invested, it now takes more capital to push prices much higher than in past cycles. Wall Street is involved as well. Equities are still a common way for institutions to get exposure to the cryptocurrency market, and more than $100 billion in IPOs related to the cryptocurrency space are anticipated . With this kind of activity, Wall Street has a clear incentive to maintain the momentum, and may boost the market during slow periods. July has historically been a profitable month for Bitcoin. With an average return of roughly 9%, it has closed positive in seven of the previous ten years. In the upcoming weeks, Bitcoin may test the $116,000–$120,000 range if that pattern holds true, especially with improved sentiment in equity markets and a more supportive Fed backdrop. But to break through that ceiling, a fresh surge of inflows might be required. Without fresh capital, particularly from retail or new institutions, the rally could fade into another round of sideways trading.

On Thursday, the platform met with SEC officials to discuss digital asset issuance, commodities, and tokenized securities. Need for Consistent and Progressive Crypto Rules According to the memo , SIFMA urged the SEC to establish consistent and progressive rules for crypto and a clear regulatory approach for platforms involved in digital assets. SIFMA also encouraged the SEC to establish innovative approaches that match the current technological advancements. It also suggested that the SEC take a ‘holistic approach’ to incorporate— technological updates, classification of securities and digital commodities, open development of digital securities with transparency, and provision of cross-border applicability in the crypto landscape. Key Highlights of SIFMA’s Meeting with the SEC The initiative aims to integrate traditional finance (TradFi) with the crypto space, with major crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). SIFMA also seeks to promote regulatory clarity with consistent and progressive crypto rules to foster innovation and facilitate merging TradFi into the crypto market in the US. The effort also aims to establish a unified regulatory approach for issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets. SIFMA also highlighted that the SEC should ensure the functions of— exchange and broker-dealer, trading and custody, promoting competition and compatibility of service providers— in digital commodities, and tokenized securities. [post_titles_links postid=”478482″] Promoting the Adoption of Digital Assets SIFMA, holder of nearly 90% of the US financial market share, noted the growing demand of TradFi players to adopt digital assets into their products and services. So, it proceeded to establish legal clarity on the regulatory approach for cryptocurrency. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins emphasized the necessity of establishing clear rules in crypto, he said– “To establish clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets, aiming to protect investors while encouraging responsible innovation.” Final Thought SIFMA continues to develop and encourage the regulatory framework for digital assets in the US. This move comes at a time when the nation is already at its peak of embracing digital assets by implementing a series of new laws. Despite the regulations, the approach lacks legal clarity, which will probably be resolved with with SIFMA proposal.

The funds will go to supporting the firm’s $100 million crypto reserve target. On July 3, the Singaporean -based firm has managed to reach more than a quarter of its initial goal to establish a diversified crypto reserve fund worth $100 million. The private placement was valued at $10.45 per share, deducted from a 5% discount to the company’s three-day volume weighted average trading price. According to the filing document , the capital raised from the private placement will be used to boost its crypto reserve strategy. The company aims to raise as much as $100 million to establish a crypto treasury filled with major tokens including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ). Through the notice, Amber International also announced its plans to explore potentially adopting other alternative tokens such as Binance Coin ( BNB ), Ripple ( XRP ) and Sui ( SUI ) overtime.

The private placement garnered support from a number of institutional players, including CMAG Funds, Mile Green, Pantera Capital , Choco Up, Kingkey Financial International among others. More often than not, when a company publishes a notice about raised capital that will go towards supporting its crypto reserves, the company stock experiences a surge. The same can be said about Amber International. At press time, Amber International’s stock managed to see modest gains of 0.12%, rising from its previous closed market price at $8.60. Earlier today, the stock experienced a sharp spike, bounding up to as high as $9.56. However the peak was short lived as it took a nosedive down to $8.40. Most recently, Spain’s Vanadi Coffee and Swedish gaming firm Fragbite Group enjoyed highs in its stock price after announcing that its shareholders have decided to add crypto to the company balance sheets. In recent months, there have been an increasing number of companies worldwide adopting crypto reserve strategies, many of them citing Michael Saylor’s Strategy as inspiration. While others have called it an attempt to hedge inflation or as a starting point in their venture into the web3 business.

As Bitcoin edges toward new highs and altcoins follow suit, DOGE price has climbed steadily, capturing attention with its trademark blend of community power and price volatility. Beyond memes, Dogecoin is benefiting from rising speculation around potential ETF inclusion, along with broader adoption through social media platforms and integrations. The question now: Is Dogecoin preparing for another breakout or just enjoying a temporary revival? ETF Buzz: Could Dogecoin Be Next? The excitement around a potential Dogecoin ETF is growing rapidly in 2025 as major asset managers like Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise file applications with the SEC. The recent delays by the authorities have not dimmed optimism, with some of the analysts assigning a 90% chance of approval by the year-end. Therefore, if approved, it could unlock institutional interest with an increase in liquidity and legitimise the memecoin within the broader financial system. The next key date is August 17, 2025, when the SEC is expected to respond to the 21Shares application. DOGE has already seen bullish sentiment, driven by speculation surrounding this ETF. With the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs setting a precedent, Dogecoin could be the next in line for mainstream adoption. What’s Next: Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Reach $1 in 2025? If the short-term fractals are kept aside, the long-term price action displays huge potential for a continued ascending trend. After the latest rejection from a resistance zone between $0.2180 and $0.2327, the bulls are trying hard to elevate the levels back above $0.2, but the bears seem to have capitulated the range just below the resistance. The weekly chart analysis suggests the price has held the ascending trend line as a strong support and recently triggered a rebound. Besides, the weekly MACD, which has been within the negative range since the start of the year, displays a drop in selling volume and pressure. Meanwhile, the weekly DMI is about to turn bullish as the conversion line and base line are heading for a bullish crossover. Interestingly, the weekly candle has just turned into a bearish Doji, and historically, this has been followed by a range-bound consolidation, a small pullback and a massive rise. Therefore, the Dogecoin (DOGE) price is expected to remain compressed between $0.165 and $0.177 for a while, followed by a strong rise to the resistance zone between $0.218 and $0.232. A breakout from this range could help the price to achieve $0.25.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/dogecoin-price-prediction-for-july-2025-doge-price-strengthens-case-for-a-move-to-0-25/,"TRADING|DOGE|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T11:02:44,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – July 4, 2025","In complete contrast to yesterday’s picture, the crypto market is down today, with nearly all of the top 100 coins per market cap seeing their prices fall over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped 4.2% to $3.43 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $97.3 billion, notably down compared to yesterday’s $120 billion. TLDR: The crypto market turned downwards; BTC stands mostly unchanged at $108,836, while ETH fell 2% to $2,547; ’All eyes are now on the Fed, macro data, and further geopolitical developments’; ‘ETH has the stronger momentum narrative, but BTC’s options market is coiled for a decisive move; US spot BTC ETFs recorded the highest positive daily flow in six weeks, spot ETH ETFs resumed inflows; ’Traders are betting on a big July’. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, only one of the top 10 coins per market cap is green. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 0.4%, meaning it’s mostly unchanged, currently trading at $108,836. Ethereum (ETH) has seen a drop of 2.1%, currently changing hands at $2,547. Dogecoin (DOGE) saw the highest decrease in this category: 4.4% to the price of $0.1673. At the same time, Tron (TRX) is the only green coin, but with a rise of 0.4%, meaning it’s practically unchanged over the past day at $0.2856. Moreover, five of the top 100 coins saw increases, but only one of them was high enough to move the price. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is up 1.8% to $0.01576. On the other hand, Pepe (PEPE) saw the highest decrease of 8.3% to $0.000009791.

Earlier this week, it said it planned to raise $112.5 million through private placements, expected to close Monday. News: DeFi Development Corp (Nasdaq: $DFDV ) has purchased 17,760 Solana coins for $2.72 million.

The newly acquired… pic.twitter.com/bDftGzhBH4 — Crypto Coin Show (@CryptoCoinShow) July 4, 2025 ‘Traders are Betting on a Big July’ Sean Dawson, Head of Research at decentralized onchain options platform, Derive.xyz , commented that “June’s biggest price swings were geopolitical.” We saw major drawdowns during key escalation points in the Middle East on June 13 and 22. That said, “limited volatility spikes tell us markets were betting on limited fallout. That’s exactly what played out,” Dawson says. “The muted response in monthly volatility suggests traders correctly anticipated that hostilities would be contained.” Moreover, volatility trended lower across both ETH and BTC. The former’s 30-day implied volatility fell from 44% to 36% and the latter’s from 68% to 60%. BTC and ETH 30-day volatility Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata Dawson continues: “Traders are betting on a big July, with volatility suppressed and positioning split, all eyes are now on the Fed, macro data, and further geopolitical developments. ETH has the stronger momentum narrative, but BTC’s options market is coiled for a decisive move.” Upside catalysts for BTC to hit $130,000 include the US Federal Reserve rate cuts at the 29 July meeting (25% chance) and de-escalation in Israel’s war against Iran and Palestine. Downside catalysts that could result in the price retreating to $90,000 include a hawkish Fed tone, hot inflation print, increased tensions in the Middle East, ETF outflows, and miner capitulation. Finally, per Dawson, there’s a 10% chance that BTC will surpass $130,000 by the end of August, and a 15% chance ETH will surpass $3,300 in that same period. ETH sentiment is significantly more bullish than BTC’s, he says. “ Robinhood’s announcement of an L2 on Arbitrum for tokenized stocks in the EU could reignite the real-world asset (RWA) narrative around Ethereum.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $108,836. It has seen quite choppy trading over the past day. The price fell to the $180,830 level twice, and its current price is its intraday low. This follows a drop from a daily high of $110,386. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,547. As the chart shows, the coin went on a continual drop from the daily high of $2,630 to the lowest daily point so far of $2,532, before rising slightly to the current price. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment remains mostly unchanged within neutral territory. The Fear and Greed Index increased from 55 yesterday to 55 today . Investors continue to wait for additional news and signals that would prompt a further rise to greed or a drop to fear. Notably, on 3 July, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded inflows of a whopping $601.94 million . This marks the highest positive daily flow in six weeks, since 22 May. Of the total amount, Fidelity accounts for $237.13 million, BlackRock $224.04 million, and Ark & 21 Shares $114.25 million. Also, on 3 July, US ETH ETFs recorded inflows of $148.57 million , significantly higher than the 2 July outflow of $1.82 million. BlackRock and Fidelity saw the highest positive flows of $85.38 million and $64.65 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Singapore-based crypto firm Amber International completed a $25.5 million private placement for its $100 million crypto ecosystem reserve fund. The Nasdaq-listed company announced its crypto reserve strategy early this year diversifying allocations in Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana . It’s now expanding to Binance Coin , XRP , and SUI . Amber International is aiming to progress its $100 million crypto reserve strategy with a $25.5 million private placement. #AmberInternational #Cryptostrategy https://t.co/hKCJsVwdHl — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 4, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market has dropped over the past 24 hours, while the US stock market saw another day of mixed performance on Wednesday. For example, the S&P 500 increased by 0.83%, the Nasdaq-100 went up by 0.99%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.77%. However, Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler , argues that Bitcoin “stands poised to follow equities to new highs.” This week saw a surge in optimism across US equity markets, with the S&P 500 hitting a new ATH. “If the S&P 500 holds above its previous February peak following the release of the Non-Farm Payrolls data in the coming weeks, it could serve as a strong technical and psychological catalyst not just for equities but also for the cryptocurrency market.” Is this dip sustainable? This appears to be another short-term dip in the market, marking minor decreases before additional pushes higher. In the medium term, analysts expect the prices to continue increasing overall, regardless of unavoidable drops.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin’s rebound to $110,000 signals a new cycle of opportunity, one that platforms like GMO Miner are helping users navigate with stable daily passive income. Table of Contents Three major events in July How to earn stable crypto income amid high volatility GMO Miner platform advantages How to start the cloud mining journey Summary On Wednesday, Bitcoin ( BTC ) touched $110,000, hitting a new high since mid-June, with a 24-hour increase of 3.5%. At the same time, the Nasdaq index rose 0.8%, and global risk asset sentiment rebounded significantly. This round of rebound is not accidental, but a systematic recovery under the interweaving of multiple policies and market benefits. With the emergence of key events in July, the crypto market has quietly entered a new cycle of “high volatility + high opportunities”. Three major events in July 1. The US-Vietnam trade agreement boosted market confidence Trump announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam: the United States imposes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on transit goods; while the Vietnamese market is completely duty-free for US products. This policy is seen as a signal to stimulate exports, which not only improves market risk appetite but also benefits crypto assets. 2. The first Solana staking ETF is launched, and institutions are accelerating their entry The SSK fund issued by REX-Osprey has a first-day trading volume of over $20 million, far exceeding the first-day performance of the SOLZ ETF in March, indicating that staking assets have entered the mainstream vision and injected more certainty into the crypto infrastructure. 3. Three key time nodes will affect market trends July 5-7: The $3.3 trillion “One, Big, Beautiful Act” is expected to be signed, which may trigger a depreciation of the US dollar and an inflow of safe-haven funds. July 9: A new round of tariff measures will take effect, which may intensify global trade tensions. July 22: The US cryptocurrency executive order expires, and the national strategic BTC reserve plan may be announced.

2025-07-04T11:00:08,"Over $1b flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs as macro sentiment improves","U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded over $1 billion in net inflows over the last two trading sessions as macroeconomic concerns cooled after President Donald Trump revealed a trade deal with an ASEAN member state. According to data from SoSoValue, inflows totaled $407.78 million on July 2, followed by $601.94 million on July 3, the highest single-day inflow since May 23. Notably, on Thursday, Fidelity’s FBTC led the highest inflows with $237.13 million flowing into the fund, followed closely by BlackRock’s IBIT with $224.53 million inflows. ARK 21Shares’ ARKB saw $114.25 million, while Bitwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s GBTC, and VanEck’s HODL collectively drew $26.03 million. All other BTC ETFs reported zero flows on the day. The renewed inflows come just days after the U.S. Senate passed Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” on July 1, a bill that, despite lacking provisions directly related to crypto, initially triggered uncertainty in digital asset markets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs had posted their first daily outflow on July 1, ending a 15-day consecutive inflow streak, before rebounding sharply within the next two trading sessions. You might also like: Japan’s Minna Bank teams up with Fireblocks and Solana Japan to explore stablecoins Investor sentiment appears to have rebounded partly due to optimism around Trump’s new trade pact with Vietnam. The agreement seeks to rebalance trade by imposing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports and a 40% levy on transshipped goods, while eliminating tariffs on U.S. exports to Vietnam. This helped ease broader macroeconomic uncertainty and boosted risk assets across markets. Further, Trump has also been pressuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates and has even called for his resignation, accusing him of failing to lower interest rates fast enough to stimulate economic growth. He has even hinted at appointing a successor well before Powell’s term ends in May 2026, seeking candidates who would support aggressive rate cuts, like Scott Bessent, Kevin Warsh, or Christopher Waller. The political pressure has weighed on the U.S. dollar, which has declined in recent sessions as investors increasingly price in the possibility of looser monetary policy and reduced central bank independence. As the dollar continues to slide, investor appetite for risk assets, including Bitcoin, has climbed, reflected clearly in the sharp rise in ETF inflows. Looking ahead, the influx of institutional capital into Bitcoin ETFs could signal a potentially strong July for Bitcoin price action, challenging its historical trend of underperformance in Q3. Analysts have already started calling out short-term targets ranging between $117,000-$135,000, with long-term projections as high as $200,000 by the end of this year . As of press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was priced at $109,044 when writing, down roughly 1% over the past day.

Key Takeaways: US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a strong rebound with over $1 billion in net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC led inflows with $421 million in two days, while BlackRock’s IBIT attracted $224.5 million. Year-to-date, the ETFs have attracted $14.5 billion in net inflows. The turnaround signals renewed investor confidence, with cumulative inflows since launch approaching the $50 billion mark. According to data from Farside Investors , Wednesday brought $407.8 million in net inflows, followed by $601.8 million on Thursday. Fidelity’s FBTC Tops Bitcoin ETF Inflows With $421M Over Two Days Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge both days, adding $184 million and $237.1 million, respectively. BlackRock’s flagship IBIT fund, typically the top performer, saw an uncharacteristic pause at the start of July with two days of zero flows — its first since April — but bounced back strongly on Thursday with $224.5 million in new inflows. This week’s rally resumed the positive trend from June, when the ETFs logged a 15-day streak totaling $4.7 billion in net inflows, 81% of which flowed into BlackRock’s IBIT. Year-to-date, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have now attracted $14.5 billion in net inflows and control nearly $128 billion in assets under management, led by IBIT’s $73.6 billion. Commenting on IBIT’s explosive growth, Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, noted it has already become BlackRock’s third-highest revenue-generating ETF out of 1,197 products, surpassing even some of the firm’s flagship traditional funds. The nearly $75bil iShares Bitcoin ETF has only one month of outflows since Jan 2024 launch… Now generates more fee revenue for BlackRock than its largest ETF, the iShares S&P 500 ETF.

I offer a few thoughts here. via @isabelletanlee https://t.co/uDv6eiVb4b pic.twitter.com/pPwMQbfplW — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2025 Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas added that IBIT is just $9 billion away from becoming BlackRock’s top ETF by revenue. Thursday also saw the highest daily trading volume for Bitcoin ETFs since May, hitting $5.3 billion, with IBIT contributing $4.1 billion. Since their debut in January 2024, the ETFs have recorded more than $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume, highlighting their role in drawing institutional and retail investors into Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles. Analysts See 95% Odds of Solana, XRP, Litecoin ETF Approvals Last week, Balchunas and Seyffart assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. While the final deadlines for individual altcoin ETFs arrive in October, the analysts predict 90% approval odds for other tokens like Dogecoin and Cardano by year-end, but note Sui and Tron ETFs face more regulatory uncertainty with only 60% and 50% odds, respectively. In April, Balchunas revealed that more than 70 cryptocurrency ETFs are currently awaiting review by the SEC. The lineup features a broad range of digital assets beyond Bitcoin, including XRP, Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, and various crypto derivatives.

2025-07-04T10:30:09,"Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says","The wait for altcoin season continues as the crypto market is still showing signs of bearish movement. Expectations are high that the altcoin market will begin to rally soon, but not everyone is optimistic that the altcoin season is coming. One of those is market analyst and expert Stockmoney Lizards, who has said that it is not happening soon. Altcoin Season Is Not Happening Soon In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Stockmoney Lizards informed their over 160,000 followers that the altcoin season could not be happening anytime soon. The analyst said that it is “not even remotely close”, pointing to the rising Bitcoin dominance as the reason why the altcoin season is still far off. Related Reading: Analyst Says Cycle Is Not Finished Amid 2 Years Of Bitcoin Sideways Movement Analyzing the chart, the market expert explains that despite the Bitcoin dominance having fallen by around 2%, it still doesn’t mean much. This is because the dominance is still very strong and continues to trade inside the channel. This channel also charts a possible increase in the Bitcoin dominance from here, which would be detrimental for altcoins. So far, the Bitcoin dominance has also managed to hold above 65%. While this is not the highest it has ever been, it is still incredibly high, with previous altcoin seasons not happening until the dominance had fallen toward 40%. The analyst doesn’t entirely rule out the possibility of an altcoin season, saying it will still come. However, for now, Bitcoin continues to dominate, as he explains that “BTC is the measure of all things.” Altcoin Dominance Reaches 2021 Levels As the Bitcoin dominance has risen and the altcoin dominance has fallen, they have gone toward levels not seen in years. For example, the last time the Bitcoin dominance was above 65% was back in 2021 before it crashed to usher in the altcoin season, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: AI Founder Puts XRP Price As High As $20-$30 Even worse is the Ethereum dominance, which has dropped to 5-year lows. Sitting at only 8%, it is now at levels recorded back in 2020 before the market rebounded from the COVID-19 crash. This has greatly diminished Ethereum’s ability to pull the altcoin market up with it. In the same vein, the altcoin dominance, excluding Ethereum, has now dropped to 26%. The last time that the OTHERS dominance was this low was in 2021. However, this was right around when the altcoin season was starting, suggesting that the current market could be at the cusp of another altcoin run. Nevertheless, for there to be any sustainable altcoin season, the Bitcoin dominance must first crash. Going by what happened back in 2017 and 2021, at least a 40% crash in the Bitcoin dominance is required to usher in the altcoin season.

2025-07-04T10:29:33,"Google Gemini Predicts Cardano (ADA) Price for July 31, 2025","Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.5905, reflecting a 5.76% increase over the past 24 hours. Looking ahead, we asked Google’s Gemini AI to predict the digital asset’s price by July 31, 2025, and the AI model has high expectations for ADA. Gemini bases its bullish projection on several factors, most notably the ongoing crypto market cycle, Cardano’s ecosystem development and key partnerships, and growing institutional interest. The AI categorizes the prediction as a “bullish yet realistic” scenario, anchored in historical patterns and expected network growth. Cardano (ADA) Price Target Breakdown Gemini outlines three tiers of price targets within its bullish framework: Conservative Case ($1.8): This assumes that ADA will break past its 2024 highs and benefit from general altcoin market strength. Optimistic Case ($2.3): Reflects mid-cycle optimism with increased DeFi activity on the Cardano network. Aggressive Bullish Case ($3): A scenario where ADA comes close to its previous all-time high, last seen in September 2021, supported by “strong network usage and macro tailwinds.” These targets are framed around the idea that the crypto market may be entering a peak bullish phase. As Gemini notes, “2024 was a Bitcoin halving year ,” and if historical patterns hold, the 12–18 months following such events often represent the most active part of the cycle. The AI references ADA’s previous all-time high of $3.1, suggesting that a return to similar levels is plausible under favorable market conditions. Supporting Factors Gemini attributes its outlook to several key developments within the Cardano ecosystem. The platform has evolved significantly, and the decision to partner with Ripple and the XRP community has opened new doors for Cardano. Cardano’s creator, Charles Hoskinson, previously stated that RLUSD would be integrated into the ADA DeFi ecosystem . With ongoing projects launching to boost the ecosystem’s utility, ADA could experience a major price surge soon. Another supportive factor is growing institutional interest . Cardano’s academic approach and compliance-focused development make it a strong candidate for capital inflows in a more regulated environment. Gemini also noted that if crypto spot ETFs expand beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, ADA may be among the next group of assets to benefit. Bloomberg analysts recently predicted a 90% chance that spot Cardano ETFs will be approved this year , and approval as early as July could help ADA reach Gemini’s $3 target by the end of the month. ADA currently trades well below the projected bullish targets at $0.5905, but under optimal market and ecosystem conditions, it could reach the target range of $1.8 to $3 by July 31.

2025-07-04T10:28:29,"Altcoin Season Could Explode If Bitcoin Holds Above $100K","The post Altcoin Season Could Explode If Bitcoin Holds Above $100K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin spent most of Q2 moving sideways and is now retesting the key $110K resistance as Q3 kicks off. A breakout could push it toward $120K, though it may take time. Standard Chartered also expects BTC to hit $120K by August or September . However, short-term dips are still expected. Experts say $100,000 is the key level to watch this quarter. If Bitcoin holds above it, the outlook stays strong. But if it falls below, the price could drop to around $88,000, where many buyers might jump in. For now, the market seems to be gearing up for a big move, and any short-term pullbacks could be seen as a chance to buy at lower prices. Let’s see if we are hitting an alt-season or not. This Altcoin Season Is Different Looking at the possible scenarios of Q3 2025, a crypto analyst from Selected Investments urges investors to stay alert. Despite the summer lull, key macro events unfolding over the next few months could determine whether Bitcoin and altcoins push toward a final bull market top or fall short. He compared the previous cycles, wherein Bitcoin peaked roughly 525–546 days post-halving. Applying the same timeline to the April 2024 halving puts the projected top in mid-October 2025. However, the analyst warns that history alone can’t predict outcomes. Unlike past cycles, current macro conditions like tighter global liquidity and elevated interest rates create a vastly different backdrop. Global Liquidity Tight, But That Could Change Soon The analyst points to a key metric like global M2 money supply growth. Compared to the liquidity booms of 2017 and 2021, 2025 shows far more constrained conditions. Interest rates remain high, around 4.5%, but analysts now anticipate rate cuts in the coming months. July carries a 25% chance of a 25 bps cut, with probabilities rising to 71% in September and 56% in October for deeper cuts. These would likely boost market liquidity and benefit-risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. [post_titles_links postid=”478580″] Altcoins Still Quiet, But TVL Signals Underlying Strength Despite Bitcoin nearing its all-time high at $108K , the Fear and Greed Index is only at 46, indicating a lack of retail interest, a scenario that often precedes explosive moves. The analyst believes this quiet strength is a signal that the altcoin season is still ahead. Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi is nearing $115 billion, not far from the $175 billion peak in 2021, even though altcoin prices remain subdued. Ethereum’s Next Move Depends on Macro Shifts Ethereum remains rangebound around $2,500, facing key resistance. The analyst sees a potential breakout if macro conditions improve. Historically, Q4 has delivered outsized gains, with Bitcoin averaging 85% returns and Ethereum 24%. With Bitcoin dominance still high, a meaningful shift could break a full-fledged altcoin rally. In short, Q3 could be the calm before a storm, especially if rate cuts and liquidity injections align.

An “altcoin season,” or “altseason,” is a period when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin in price growth. This typically occurs when capital rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to rapid and substantial gains across a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies, often accompanied by a decrease in Bitcoin’s market dominance. How is the crypto market doing today? As of July 4, 2025, the crypto market is showing mixed performance. Bitcoin is trading around $109,033, down slightly by 0.85% in the last 24 hours but has seen recent highs near $110,500. Ethereum is around $2,573, gaining momentum. The global crypto market cap is approximately $3.40 trillion, with some altcoins seeing minor gains (like XRP, Solana, Tron) while others experience slight declines. Institutional demand and ETF inflows continue to drive long-term bullish sentiment despite short-term volatility. What indicators suggest an “altcoin season” might still be ahead despite Bitcoin’s recent surge? Despite Bitcoin nearing its all-time high ($109,112), the Fear and Greed Index is only at 46 (Neutral), indicating a lack of retail FOMO often seen before explosive altcoin moves. Additionally, Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi is nearing its 2021 peak ($115 billion vs. $175 billion), signaling underlying strength even with subdued altcoin prices.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/altcoin-season-could-explode-if-bitcoin-holds-above-100k/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|ETH|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T10:25:00,"Bitcoin on the Brink of All-Time High as Macro Tailwinds Gather Strength","Bitcoin BTC looks poised to climb to an all-time high this July, propelled by converging macroeconomic and market forces that are driving investors into riskier assets. U.S. equity indexes are already setting records, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all sitting at highs, reflecting widespread investor confidence. As traditional markets soar, capital often spills into alternative assets, and BTC is a prime beneficiary. At around $109,000, the largest cryptocurrency is trading less than 3% below the peak it set in May. One factor is the U.S. M2 money supply, which has climbed to a record $21.9 trillion and has touched highs each month over the past year. This surge in liquidity means potentially more money flowing into financial assets and a hunt for investments that can preserve purchasing power as government debt balloons. According to Ray Dalio , the billionaire founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, President Donald Trump's newly passed ""Big Beautiful Bill"" locks in roughly $7 trillion in annual spending against only $5 trillion in revenue. That will push debt levels from 100% of GDP toward 130% over the next decade. “Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur,” he wrote in a post on X. Historically, July has been a strong month for bitcoin, averaging gains around 7%, adding a seasonal tailwind.

2025-07-04T10:19:29,"Expert Calls Bitcoin Price at $110,000 Undervalued","A prominent market expert says Bitcoin price is undervalued at current levels, sparking debate on its future potential. Bitcoin's price has been steadily climbing in recent days, reaching a peak of over $110,300 on July 3. Currently priced at $108,691, Bitcoin has experienced a slight dip of -0.71% in the past 24 hours but has gained 1.65% over the last 7 days. This upward momentum in recent days has fueled discussions within the community, with notable crypto commentary provider Altcoin Daily taking a bold stance on the digital asset’s future.Bitcoin Price at $110,000 is UndervaluedAccording to Altcoin Daily, Bitcoin’s current price level is ""undervalued,"" with the account suggesting that the cryptocurrency has substantial upside potential. https://twitter.com/AltcoinDaily/status/1940883744615026810The assertion that Bitcoin at $110K is undervalued has sparked debate among followers, particularly about the future direction of its price. Some community members are increasingly optimistic, with some commenters even predicting that Bitcoin could hit $1 million.However, not all responses have been unequivocally positive. One commenter questioned the valuation, asking, ""Undervalued at $110K? What fundamental analysis or metrics support this valuation?"" Others remained cautious, arguing that the market has yet to confirm a breakout above $110,530 and warning that macroeconomic factors such as inflation and tariffs could continue to pose risks to Bitcoin price rally.Altcoin Daily's statement aligns with other experts on the social platform X. For instance, Crypto Rover asserts that Bitcoin is currently ""undervalued,"" also suggesting it has substantial upside potential. Bitcoin Price Undervalued | Crypto Rover The analyst points to the rising global liquidity as a key factor driving Bitcoin's price growth. With the increase in liquidity, Crypto Rover believes the Bitcoin price is poised for significant appreciation.Previous Bullish Commentaries by Altcoin DailyNotably, Altcoin Daily has been steadfastly bullish on Bitcoin. Just a few days earlier, the platform expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, stating that when Bitcoin surpasses $150K, investors would look back at these times and regret not buying more when prices were lower. This sentiment echoes the platform’s continued optimism about Bitcoin’s future performance.Exec Advises Buying BitcoinMeanwhile, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, has encouraged investors to buy Bitcoin, citing concerns raised by hedge fund manager Ray Dalio. https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan/status/1940883904715804682Dalio warned about the U.S. government’s growing debt, which now exceeds $7 trillion in annual spending against $5 trillion in revenue. The national debt is surpassing the government's income and each household’s share has reached $230,000.

2025-07-04T10:10:17,"Two Bitcoin whales from 2011 move 20,000 BTC worth $2.81 billion","The global digital assets market recorded a minor pullback on Friday as Bitcoin was unable to hold the $109K mark. Amid this drawdown, on-chain data shows that two resting BTC whale wallets woke up and chose to move around 20,000 Bitcoin (approx. $2.18 billion). Bitcoin price is now up by 89% over the past year. This move comes in when US lawmakers prepare for a landmark legislative blitz, “Crypto Week.” The event is scheduled for July 14–18, when the House is set to review and potentially pass three key bills that could reshape the American crypto landscape. Dormant Bitcoin wallets move $2.18b+ As per the data shared by Lookonchain, one wallet (12tLs9c9Rs) first bought 10,000 BTC for a mere $7,805 back in April 2011 when Bitcoin was trading at $0.78, and moved its holding just a few hours ago. Now, that same haul is worth over $1 billion. Just moments later, a second wallet (1KbrSKrT3Ge) was caught moving another 10,000 BTC, bringing the total to $2.18 billion moved in a single morning. That’s a jaw-dropping 140,000x return on the original investment of $7,805. However, it is still not confirmed that these two wallets are linked to one person or entity. Another wallet of this Bitcoin OG also transferred out 10,000 $BTC ($1.09B) just now after being dormant for 14+ years. 14 years ago, $BTC was only $0.78 — that’s a mind-blowing 140,000x return! https://t.co/e2m8AunEMc https://t.co/G0YXqPi4mK pic.twitter.com/E1fgGlYA4u — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 4, 2025 All this comes as markets are still hesitating. Bitcoin rallied past $110,000 overnight, then pulled back to $108K levels. Despite US Bitcoin Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continuing to accumulate, corporate treasuries stacking BTC, the market seems split between bullish momentum and macro caution. Bitcoin price is up by more than 3% in the last 30 days and is trading at an average price of $108,895 at press time. The biggest crypto is just inches away from reclaiming its recently made all-time high of around $112K. GOP pushes crypto bills The timing of this on-chain event comes when Republicans are planning to bring three major crypto bills to the floor. Every investor’s eyes are on the CLARITY Act (market structure), the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the Senate’s recently passed GENIUS Act, which aims to put stablecoins under a federal regulatory framework. In a coordinated announcement on Thursday, House Financial Services Chair French Hill, Agriculture Chair Glenn “GT” Thompson, and Speaker Mike Johnson declared their intent to move forward with these acts. “House Republicans are taking decisive steps to deliver the full scope of President Trump’s digital assets and cryptocurrency agenda,” Johnson said in a statement. The push indicates the most aggressive legislative effort yet to align US crypto regulation with the GOP’s pro-business platform. This includes placing privacy, decentralization, and market freedom at the heart of the nation’s digital asset framework. Republican leaders say the goal is to make the US the crypto capital of the world, while protecting financial sovereignty in the face of growing global CBDC adoption. “This is a historic opportunity,” said Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a longtime crypto advocate. “By sending these three pieces of legislation to President Trump’s desk, we will protect Americans’ right to financial privacy.” The cumulative crypto market stood at $3.35 trillion, with the 24 hour trading volume of $109.4 billion. The stablecoin market cap is at just $264.4 billion, where Tether’s USDT is leading the race with $158.4 billion cap. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-04T10:10:00,"Y Combinator Alum Unleashes $34M Fund to Propel Next-Gen Startups","BitcoinWorld Y Combinator Alum Unleashes $34M Fund to Propel Next-Gen Startups The world of startup investment is constantly evolving, and at its core lies the transformative power of accelerators like Y Combinator . For those tracking high-growth opportunities, a significant development has emerged: a new, dedicated fund poised to capitalize on the unparalleled success of YC companies. This initiative, spearheaded by a seasoned YC alum, promises to reshape the landscape for emerging ventures, particularly within the burgeoning tech sector. The Enduring Power of Y Combinator: A Goldmine for Investors? For decades, Y Combinator has stood as a beacon of innovation, a launchpad for some of the world’s most successful companies. Its rigorous program and expansive network have consistently delivered exceptional returns to investors. Kulveer Taggar, a two-time YC alum and a figure well-versed in the startup ecosystem, underscores this potential. “If you look at the data: 6% of YC companies become unicorns, and of that 6% a quarter become decacorns,” Taggar shared with Bitcoin World. This impressive track record highlights why investment in YC-backed ventures is often seen as a strategic move. Taggar, best known for founding Zeus Living, a property management startup that secured over $150 million in funding, has channeled his confidence in YC’s continued return potential into a new venture: Phosphor Capital. This firm is uniquely dedicated solely to investing in YC companies. Since its inception last year, Phosphor Capital has successfully raised $34 million in capital across two distinct funds, signaling strong investor belief in its focused strategy. Navigating the Landscape of Venture Capital with a Unique Edge In the competitive realm of Venture Capital , differentiation is key. While Phosphor Capital is not the sole firm concentrating on YC startups—Pioneer Fund and Rebel Fund employ similar strategies—it distinguishes itself as the only dedicated YC fund led by a solo General Partner. This structure allows for streamlined decision-making and a highly personalized approach to portfolio companies. Phosphor Capital’s investment strategy involves writing checks ranging from $100,000 to $500,000, providing crucial early-stage capital to promising YC graduates. This targeted investment size enables the fund to build a diverse portfolio, mitigating risk while maximizing exposure to high-potential startups. The firm has already backed over 200 YC companies, a testament to its active engagement and rapid deployment of capital. Several of these early investments have already progressed to successfully raise Series A funding, demonstrating the efficacy of Phosphor’s selection process and support. Why Garry Tan’s Backing Signals a New Era for YC Startups A significant vote of confidence for Phosphor Capital comes from an influential figure within the YC ecosystem: Garry Tan , the current CEO of Y Combinator. Taggar’s deep and enduring relationship with YC played a pivotal role in securing Tan as an investor in the fund. Their connection dates back to 2007 when Taggar, alongside his cousin Harj Taggar and future Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, brought their startup, Auctomatic, through the accelerator program. This early experience forged a strong bond with the top accelerator. Their paths intertwined again in 2011 when Taggar returned to YC with Zeus Living. Initialized Capital, co-founded by Garry Tan, led Zeus Living’s Series A funding round and joined its board, further cementing their professional relationship. Taggar views Tan’s leadership at Y Combinator as transformative. “You could view this as a bet on Garry. I think he is taking Y Combinator to new levels,” Taggar stated, emphasizing the strategic alignment and shared vision between the two. Propelling Innovation: The Focus on AI Startups One of the most exciting areas of focus for Phosphor Capital is the burgeoning field of AI Startups . Taggar expressed particular enthusiasm for the opportunities presented by young companies leveraging artificial intelligence. The rapid advancements in AI technology are creating fertile ground for disruptive innovations across various industries, making it a prime target for early-stage investment. Phosphor Capital’s portfolio already reflects this strategic emphasis on AI. Among the over 200 YC companies it has backed, several prominent AI-driven ventures stand out. For instance, workflow automation platform Gumloop and AI meeting manager Circleback have both successfully secured Series A funding after receiving initial support from Phosphor. These examples highlight the fund’s ability to identify and nurture promising AI technologies that are poised for significant growth and impact. From Founder to Funder: A Masterclass in Startup Funding Kulveer Taggar’s journey from a two-time YC founder to a dedicated investor provides a unique perspective on Startup Funding . Unlike many emerging managers, Taggar experienced a relatively smooth capital-raising process for Phosphor Capital. His established relationships with previous investors, including those from Zeus Living, proved invaluable. “I had a relationship with them and a track record, so they knew me, and they knew how hard I work,” he explained. Beyond existing relationships, Phosphor’s limited partners (LPs) also include family offices and a large asset manager, who are betting on Taggar primarily due to his deep and long-standing ties to Y Combinator. YC partner Jared Friedman aptly described Taggar as an “OG alum from the early days of YC,” highlighting his close connections within the organization. This insider status provides Phosphor Capital with unparalleled access and insights into the YC ecosystem. Taggar’s background as a founder, complete with the challenges and triumphs of building a company like Zeus Living (which, at its peak, was valued over $200 million with an annual revenue run rate of about $120 million before facing headwinds and being sold), resonates deeply with the founders he now supports. Friedman noted, “Zeus was a really hard company to run. He has a tremendous number of battle scars from doing this hard thing in the physical world.” This firsthand experience fosters incredible empathy. “I hear this from founders that he has incredible empathy for what they are going through, because he went through it all himself,” Friedman added. This founder-centric approach makes Phosphor Capital a highly attractive partner for YC startups navigating their own growth journeys. Conclusion: A Focused Bet on the Future of Innovation Kulveer Taggar’s Phosphor Capital represents a compelling new chapter in the world of venture investment, particularly for the Y Combinator ecosystem. By leveraging deep insider knowledge, a proven track record, and the strategic backing of figures like Garry Tan, Phosphor is uniquely positioned to identify and nurture the next generation of successful startups, with a keen eye on transformative areas like artificial intelligence. This focused approach not only promises significant returns for investors but also provides invaluable support and empathy for founders building the future.

2025-07-04T10:07:33,"Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions, Recent Binance Changes, and More: Bits Recap July 4th","TL;DR Analysts remain bullish on XRP, with some eyeing a move to $2.65 or even $3, while others dream of a historic surge to $30. Binance added NEWT and SAHARA to its VIP Loan program, removed several trading pairs (impacting FIO the most), and launched new staking options for SOL-related tokens. After closing Q2 at a record $107,500, BTC hovers near $109K; while some foresee a rally toward $120K, Arthur Hayes warns of a short-term drop to $90K due to US liquidity shifts – though he stays bullish long term. XRP Forecasts Despite its daily decline of around 2.5%, the XRP price is up 6% on a weekly scale and remains the subject of bullish predictions. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Just a few days ago, the X user World of Charts argued that an XRP breakout and retest has already been confirmed , anticipating a pump above $3 sometime in July. For their part, Maxi thinks the token could mirror its impressive performance from the end of 2017 and experience a 1,200% rise in a matter of days. A jump of that type would push the price to a new historic peak of around $30, which, as of the moment, seems quite unlikely. Other popular analysts who made more realistic forecasts include Ali Martinez and Crypto Beast. The former claimed XRP could be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, “potentially setting the stage for a 15% breakout to $2.65.” Crypto Beast expects the price to make a 3x during the ongoing bull run. What’s New Around Binance? The world’s largest crypto exchange recently added Newton Protocol (NEWT) and Sahara AI (SAHARA) as new loanable assets on its VIP Loan program. Despite the support, the tokens witnessed substantial price corrections. Additionally, Binance scrapped the following spot trading pairs: ACT/EUR, FIO/BTC, TNSR/FDUSD, and TST/FDUS. Such actions usually have a negative effect on the involved coins due to reduced liquidity, less visibility, and reputational blow . FIO took the biggest blow, plunging by 8% after the announcement. Earlier today (July 4), Binance came up with another disclosure. It informed its users that they can stake their SOL, HODL BNSOL, sBNSOL, or bzSOL holdings and earn up to 6.5% APR, with boosted LAYER, ACE, and DYM airdrops distributed automatically. “But that’s not all , something new is launching soon,” the exchange teased. How’s BTC Doing? Last but not least, we will delve into the leading cryptocurrency and explore some interesting price forecasts. Bitcoin (BTC) made history in May, reaching a new all-time high of almost $112,000. In the weeks that followed, it saw a slight pullback but still closed Q2 at around $107,500 – the highest quarterly finish in its history. The crypto community remains quite bullish that the asset, currently trading just south of $109,000, could be on the verge of a rally toward a fresh peak. X user CRYPTOWZRD thinks a breakout above $110,500 could push the price to $120,000. On the other hand, Arthur Hayes (co-founder of BitMEX) predicted a short-term pullback to $90,000 due to a potential liquidity drain from the US Treasury issuing new debt following Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill. “ However, he remains a bull for the long term, viewing the possible pullback as just a temporary event.

2025-07-04T10:00:00,"Meta AI Unleashes Proactive Chatbots: A Groundbreaking Shift in User Engagement","BitcoinWorld Meta AI Unleashes Proactive Chatbots: A Groundbreaking Shift in User Engagement In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where blockchain innovations often grab headlines, another significant transformation is quietly underway: the rise of advanced artificial intelligence. Meta, a titan in the tech world, is once again pushing boundaries, introducing Meta AI chatbots designed to proactively engage users across its vast ecosystem. This move signals a profound shift in how we interact with technology, raising questions not just about convenience, but also privacy and the future of digital relationships. What Are Meta’s Proactive AI Chatbots? Imagine receiving an unsolicited message from an AI chatbot while using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. This is no longer a futuristic concept but a real development from Meta. For instance, a sample AI persona named “The Maestro of Movie Magic” might send a message like, “I hope you’re having a harmonious day! I wanted to check in and see if you’ve discovered any new favorite soundtracks or composers recently. Or perhaps you’d like some recommendations for your next movie night? Let me know, and I’ll be happy to help!” This is an example of what proactive messaging from AI chatbots could look like on Meta’s platforms. Leaked documents viewed by Business Insider revealed that Meta is working with data labeling firm Alignerr to train these customizable chatbots. These bots are designed to reach out to users unprompted and follow up on past conversations, remembering details about users. Users can create these bots within Meta’s AI Studio platform. Meta has confirmed that it is testing follow-up messaging with its AIs, with specific parameters: Chatbots will only send follow-ups within 14 days after a user initiates a conversation. The user must have sent at least five messages to the bot within that timeframe. If there is no response to the first follow-up, the chatbots will not continue messaging. Users will have the option to keep their bots private or share them through various channels, including stories, direct links, and even displaying them on their Facebook or Instagram profiles. A Meta spokesperson stated, “This allows you to continue exploring areas of interest and engage in more meaningful conversations with the AIs across our apps.” The Evolution of AI Companions and User Engagement The technology underpinning Meta’s proactive chatbots shares similarities with offerings from established AI startups like Character.AI and Replika. Both companies enable their chatbots to initiate conversations and ask questions, aiming to function as AI companions . Notably, Character.AI’s new CEO, Karandeep Anand, joined the company last month after serving as Meta’s VP of business products, highlighting the talent flow within the AI space. While Meta emphasizes the goal of fostering “meaningful conversations” and aiding Mark Zuckerberg’s quest to combat the “loneliness epidemic,” the company’s core business model remains rooted in advertising revenue. Meta has a history of leveraging algorithms to maximize user engagement , driving more eyes to advertisements through continuous scrolling, commenting, and liking. The introduction of proactive chatbots aligns with this strategy, creating new avenues for interaction and, potentially, future monetization. The Promise and Peril of Generative AI The financial implications of Meta’s ventures into generative AI are substantial. Unsealed court documents from April indicate Meta’s projection of securing $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue from its generative AI products by 2025, with an ambitious target of up to $1.4 trillion by 2035. A significant portion of this revenue is expected to come from Meta’s revenue-sharing agreements with companies hosting its open Llama collection of models. The company has also hinted that its AI assistant may eventually feature ads and offer a subscription option. However, increased engagement comes with inherent risks. Character.AI, a comparable platform, is currently facing an active lawsuit following allegations that one of its bots played a role in the death of a 14-year-old boy. When questioned about its safety protocols to prevent such incidents, Meta directed inquiries to a series of disclaimers: An AI’s response “may be inaccurate or inappropriate and should not be used to make important decisions.” AIs are not licensed professionals or experts trained to help people. “Chats with custom AIs can’t replace professional advice. You shouldn’t rely on AI chats for medical, psychological, financial, legal, or any other type of professional advice.” Regarding age limitations, Bitcoin World found no company-imposed age restrictions for using Meta AI, although laws in Tennessee and Puerto Rico do limit teen engagement with some AI services. Meta’s foray into proactive AI chatbots represents a significant leap in digital interaction, promising enhanced user engagement and personalized experiences. While the vision of helpful AI companions and substantial revenue from generative AI is compelling, the inherent risks—from data privacy to the potential for misuse and psychological impact—demand careful consideration. As these advanced Meta AI systems become more integrated into our daily lives, a critical balance must be struck between innovation and user safety, ensuring that the pursuit of engagement doesn’t compromise well-being.

The company said it processed 709 assistance requests, including 124 official freeze orders from law enforcement — many tied to transnational cybercrime investigations. In total, 41 cases led to successfully intercepted assets. MEXC also launched a $100 million Guardian Fund aimed at covering losses from protocol-level breaches. This move aligns with a broader trend among top exchanges offering user protection mechanisms, following high-profile incidents such as the $70 million hack of a DeFi aggregator in May. The report also highlights expanded risk monitoring infrastructure, with 46,311 suspicious accounts restricted and 6,184 fraud rings identified in the CIS, India, and Southeast Asia — regions seeing sharp rises in coordinated wallet fraud and account takeovers. Meanwhile, MEXC continues to update its Proof of Reserves (PoR) data, listing real-time wallet balances that exceed all user deposits. As of June 26, reserves included 4,083 BTC, 69,234 ETH, and 2.32 billion USDT. The release comes as the European Union finalizes MiCA implementation standards, and as multiple Asian regulators push for “verified solvency” policies for crypto exchanges.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz.

Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 WLD Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) is poised for potential price action as it aims to retest the $1.60 level. If optimistic momentum builds, a further bullish movement could lead to $2.12 level. However, if WLD fails to maintain its bullish trajectory, it risks dropping back to as low as $0.57. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) Worldcoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.57 1.60 2.12 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 In the first half of 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) continued its downward trend, particularly in Q1, where it hit an all-time low of $0.57. However, a glimmer of hope emerged in Q2 as the price attempted to rise from April onwards. Unfortunately, momentum faltered after reaching $1.62, and from the third week of May to the third week of June, the price fell to $0.79. Yet, the last week of June brought a positive shift, with improved geopolitical conditions helping the price surge to the $0.90 mark. This movement from April and June lows suggests a potential reawakening of bullish sentiment, as a slight upward trendline has taken support, hinting at a possible short-term rise. At this juncture, many are curious: what could propel Worldcoin higher? History shows that social sentiment often plays a crucial role in the crypto space. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s value. If optimistic momentum builds in the coming sessions, WLD might retest the $1.60 level in July. A further bullish movement could lead to a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure, breaking above the $2.12 level. Clearing this threshold and confirming a ChoCh could signal a breakout from its bearish pattern, potentially allowing Worldcoin to retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, caution is warranted. If WLD fails to maintain its bullish trajectory this year, it could drop as low as $0.57, reminding investors of the volatility inherent in the crypto market.

2025-07-04T09:45:35,"Nano Labs Begins BNB Accumulation with $50M Purchase","Chinese microchip manufacturer Nano Labs has officially started its ambitious plan to build a major treasury of BNB , the native token of Binance. On Thursday, the company confirmed it had acquired $50 million worth of BNB, marking the first step toward its goal of holding between 5% and 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply. Nano Labs reiterated its long-term target of spending up to $1 billion on BNB, with its latest purchase bringing its combined crypto holdings, including Bitcoin, to approximately $160 million. Founded in 2019 by Kong Jianping and Sun Qifeng following their tenure at hardware giant Canaan, Nano Labs went public in 2022 and specializes in high-performance computing chips and high-throughput computing solutions. While the company’s initial announcement to issue $500 million in convertible notes for its BNB treasury previously sent its stock soaring by over 106%, the latest purchase failed to generate similar enthusiasm. Nano Labs Aiming for 10% BNB Supply With BNB’s circulating supply at 145.8 million and a market capitalization of $93.4 billion, acquiring 10% at market rates would require around $926 million in additional purchases from Nano Labs. Binance’s ongoing token burns have steadily reduced BNB’s circulating supply, with Binance and its former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao reportedly holding a combined 71% of the circulating supply, according to a June 2024 Forbes report. A BNB Chain spokesperson acknowledged the increased institutional interest in BNB, stating, “We welcome all organic adoption that supports BNB and the sustainable growth of our ecosystem.” Crypto Treasuries Face Investor Scrutiny Despite a broader trend of companies adding crypto to their treasuries , some industry figures remain skeptical about the long-term appeal. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, told Bloomberg that while he remains bullish on Bitcoin, investors may question whether it makes sense to back a company holding crypto instead of purchasing the asset directly. “The question is, if you’re giving somebody $10 and they’re putting $8 into Bitcoin, are they going to do well? Yes. But you might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin,” Scaramucci said, emphasizing that investors must carefully evaluate the underlying costs tied to crypto treasury strategies.

2025-07-04T09:43:02,"Bitcoin is deep into its bull run, here’s what comes next: analyst","Bitcoin may be entering the final phase of its current bull cycle, with a potential market peak just months away, according to market analyst Rekt Capital. In a recent breakdown , the Bitcoin ( BTC ) analyst compared the current market structure to past halving cycles, using historical timeframes to estimate where Bitcoin stands. His analysis is based on a model where Bitcoin typically peaks between 518 and 550 days after halving, a pattern seen in both the 2016 and 2020 cycles. According to Rekt Capital, the market is roughly 88% through the typical post-halving period, now entering the later stages of the cycle. If the same trend holds, the next cycle top could fall within late September and mid-October 2025. #BTC Bull Market Progress: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 88.0% (Progress will speed up on Parabolic advances) $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/GPwGPR7Cz5 — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) July 1, 2025 While some market participants may expect the current cycle to stretch into 2026, Rekt Capital cautioned against extending expectations too far beyond historical patterns, saying that doing so could lead investors to miss the window of opportunity. One of the defining features of this cycle, according to Rekt Capital, is the longest post-halving reaccumulation period in Bitcoin’s history. For eight months after the April 2024 halving, BTC remained in a period of consolidation. You might also like: Bitcoin breaks through $107,000, is the stagnant period over? According to the analyst, this was necessary to offset the strong pre-halving upside that pushed the asset’s price significantly ahead of schedule and realign the cycle with historical trends. What comes next? With the crypto king still consolidating just below its all-time high, Rekt Capital explained that similar phases of slowing momentum or “price discovery corrections” occurred at this stage in both the 2017 and 2021 cycles. These periods often gave way to renewed momentum leading into the final phase of the bull market. However, he emphasized that as the cycle matures, the risk-to-reward ratio begins to shift. While some upside may remain, the scale of potential gains becomes smaller compared to the downside risk of a full-cycle correction. Rekt Capital cited historical drawdowns of 60–70% that followed prior bull market tops, underscoring the importance of managing risk and preparing for volatility. Rekt Capital also addressed the idea of cycle extensions, noting that while the current cycle could stretch slightly, as past ones have by around 30 days, using those assumptions to delay profit-taking carries risk. “The danger here is if we’re going to keep moving the goalpost, at some point we’re going to miss that bull market top,” he said. With that in mind, the analyst suggested sticking to past patterns, and that anything beyond the historical window should be treated as “bonus time” rather than a guarantee of further upside. The focus for investors, he said, should now shift toward preparing for that window, protecting gains, and not getting distracted by newer cycle narratives that lack historical backing. BTC has been in a steady climb over the past week, trading slightly over $108,840 at press time.
