2025-07-04T16:54:04,"Analysts Predict Major July Explosion for Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) Among Best Crypto Meme Coins","The post Analysts Predict Major July Explosion for Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) Among Best Crypto Meme Coins appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto Presales Heat Up—High-Utility Coins Dominate As July unfolds, crypto markets are abuzz with growing enthusiasm for high-utility presales. Investors and analysts are focusing on tokens that not only promise speculative gains but also substantial long-term utility and community-driven governance features. This trend has shifted investor attention significantly, as utility-driven tokens promise resilience against market volatility. Recent reports indicate several tokens are gaining traction. Notably, Remittix (RTX), Solaxy (SOLX), and Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) are catching investor eyes due to their innovative platforms and promising technological advances. Solaxy, in particular, aims to create a decentralized ecosystem tailored specifically to NFT creators and collectors, blending creativity with robust blockchain security. Bitcoin Bull offers dynamic leveraging solutions in a market often hungry for volatility management. Influencers like Ben Armstrong (BitBoy Crypto) have praised tokens with solid real-world use cases, underscoring that speculative fever alone rarely sustains long-term growth. According to Armstrong, coins listed on major decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and centralized platforms like Binance benefit from enhanced liquidity, security, and investor trust, making them safer bets in unpredictable markets. Why Investors are Prioritizing Utility Tokens Crypto presale participants have shifted toward utility-based projects to mitigate the risks associated with meme-driven volatility. Remittix, aiming to revolutionize global remittance systems, exemplifies this shift perfectly. By combining blockchain transparency with low transaction fees, it directly addresses a trillion-dollar market problem, boosting investor confidence through clear real-world application. Similarly, Bitcoin Bull’s innovative volatility management tools offer traders unique hedging options, gaining traction in volatile market conditions. Its strategic approach ensures investors receive both short-term profitability and long-term growth potential. However, amidst all this promising activity, another high-utility presale is quietly nearing its next explosive stage.

2025-07-04T16:50:22,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): Unveiling the July Bullish Breakout Potential","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): Unveiling the July Bullish Breakout Potential The air in the digital asset space is thick with anticipation. After a period of subdued price action and declining volatility, the crypto market is buzzing with whispers of a significant move. Specifically, astute traders on platforms like Derive.xyz are positioning themselves for a potential bullish breakout for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as July unfolds. Could this be the month that finally ignites a fresh wave of momentum? Why Are Traders Eyeing a July Breakout for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)? The primary catalyst for this heightened expectation stems from a notable decline in implied volatility (IV) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum throughout June. Implied volatility is a forward-looking measure of the market’s expectation of future price swings. When IV drops, it often signals a period of consolidation, where prices trade within a tighter range, effectively building pressure for a larger move once the equilibrium breaks. Think of it like a coiled spring – the tighter it gets compressed, the more powerful its release will be. This calm before the storm has allowed derivatives traders to strategically place their bets. Unlike spot trading, derivatives, especially options trading , allow participants to speculate on future price movements without owning the underlying asset. Their positioning provides valuable insight into collective market sentiment. Despite various global geopolitical events, such as the Middle East conflict, which caused temporary jitters, the broader sentiment among these traders suggests that any fallout will be limited, paving the way for internal market dynamics to take precedence. Is Bitcoin’s (BTC) Options Market Ready for a Decisive Move? While the overall outlook for a July surge is palpable, the nuances between Bitcoin’s (BTC) and Ethereum’s options markets are quite distinct. For Bitcoin, the options market currently presents a more balanced outlook. This doesn’t necessarily mean a lack of conviction, but rather a more even distribution of bullish and bearish bets compared to Ethereum. According to insights from The Block, Bitcoin’s options market is described as being ‘coiled for a decisive move.’ This implies that while there isn’t an overwhelming bias in one direction, the market is primed for a significant shift once a trigger emerges. Potential triggers could include: Macroeconomic Shifts: Changes in interest rate policies, inflation data, or global economic stability could provide the impetus. Institutional Flows: Continued inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs, or a fresh wave of institutional adoption, could significantly bolster demand. Technical Breakouts: A decisive break above key resistance levels on price charts could trigger a cascade of buy orders. This balanced yet ‘coiled’ nature suggests that while the direction isn’t explicitly defined by options data alone, the magnitude of the next move for Bitcoin could be substantial. What’s Fueling Ethereum’s (ETH) Strong Bullish Momentum? In stark contrast to Bitcoin’s balanced options landscape, Ethereum (ETH) is witnessing significantly stronger bullish momentum. A staggering nearly 80% of July call options for Ethereum are placed above the $3,000 mark. Call options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specified price (the strike price) by a certain date. A high concentration of call options at higher strike prices indicates strong confidence among traders that the asset will surpass those levels. This robust optimism for Ethereum is often attributed to its expanding ecosystem and tangible real-world use cases . Ethereum is not just a digital currency; it’s a foundational blockchain platform that underpins a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps). Key drivers for this optimism include: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for DeFi protocols, facilitating lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): The majority of high-value NFT collections and marketplaces are built on Ethereum, driving demand for its native token. Scalability Upgrades: Ongoing developments and successful implementations of upgrades like Dencun continue to improve Ethereum’s transaction speed and cost-efficiency, making it more attractive for developers and users. Potential Spot ETH ETFs: The recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. has opened doors for broader institutional investment, similar to Bitcoin’s trajectory, which could unleash significant capital into the ecosystem. The convergence of these factors creates a compelling narrative for Ethereum’s potential bullish breakout , making it a focal point for many in the crypto market . How Do Global Events Impact the Broader Crypto Market? While the internal dynamics of Bitcoin and Ethereum are certainly at play, it’s crucial to acknowledge the broader context of the crypto market . Global events, from geopolitical tensions to macroeconomic shifts, invariably cast a shadow, or sometimes a spotlight, on digital assets. The recent Middle East conflict, for instance, caused temporary spikes in volatility across various markets, including crypto. However, the market’s quick rebound and the anticipation of ‘limited fallout’ suggest a growing resilience. This resilience can be attributed to several factors: Market Maturation: The crypto market is no longer nascent; it has developed more robust infrastructure, liquidity, and a diverse participant base. Institutional Integration: As more traditional financial institutions engage with digital assets, their stability and risk assessment frameworks begin to influence crypto market behavior, potentially mitigating extreme reactions to external shocks. Decentralized Nature: The inherent decentralized nature of Bitcoin and Ethereum offers a perceived hedge against centralized financial system vulnerabilities, attracting capital during times of uncertainty. Understanding these external influences, alongside the specific options trading data, provides a holistic view of why July could be a pivotal month for the entire crypto market . Actionable Insights and Considerations For traders and investors navigating this potentially exciting period, here are some key takeaways: Monitor Implied Volatility: Continue to observe IV levels. A sustained low IV followed by a sharp increase often precedes significant price action. Watch Options Open Interest: Pay attention to the concentration of open interest at various strike prices for both BTC and ETH, especially for July expiries. Track Real-World Use Case Development: For Ethereum, keep an eye on developments in DeFi, NFTs, and scalability solutions, as these directly impact its fundamental value. Risk Management is Key: While the sentiment is bullish, the crypto market remains volatile. Employ proper risk management strategies, including setting stop-losses and diversifying portfolios. Stay Informed: Global macroeconomic news and regulatory updates can swiftly alter market sentiment. The current setup suggests a compelling narrative for a significant price movement in July. Whether it’s Bitcoin’s coiled energy or Ethereum’s clear bullish momentum driven by its robust ecosystem, the stage is set for an intriguing period in the digital asset space. In conclusion, the confluence of declining implied volatility and strategic positioning by derivatives traders points towards a highly anticipated July for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Bitcoin’s path may be more nuanced, Ethereum’s strong bullish options sentiment, backed by its expanding real-world utility, paints a particularly optimistic picture. As the crypto market holds its breath, the potential for a decisive bullish breakout is undeniable, making the coming weeks critical for anyone invested in the future of digital finance.

According to three sources familiar with the matter, the Washington administration has threatened Brussels with a 17% tariff on EU agricultural exports. This development has further increased tensions in the ongoing trade negotiations between the two sides. The latest warning from the US comes just before it launched a plan to impose 20% tariffs on all EU goods if the parties fail to reach a trade deal by July 9. Related News: The Governor of the Central Bank of Russia Speaks Clearly About Bitcoin (BTC) and Cryptocurrency Investments This Time! President Donald Trump is demanding that Brussels grant regulatory exemptions to U.S. companies and reduce the EU's trade surplus with the United States. The Trump administration has insisted it is determined to take tough action if no deal is reached. European Commission Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič received the warning himself during talks in Washington on Thursday, and the message was conveyed to the ambassadors of the 27 EU member states the next day. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on the same day that she hoped for an “agreement in principle” that would allow the parties to continue negotiations. However, the US is increasing pressure to reach a binding agreement by the deadline set by Trump. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T16:39:08,"Mercado Bitcoin taps XRP Ledger for $200m RWA tokenization play","As Ripple and Boston Consulting Group forecast a $19 trillion tokenized asset market by 2033, Mercado Bitcoin is staking its claim early, with plans to deploy $200 million in regulated instruments on XRPL. In a press release on July 4, Ripple announced that Mercado Bitcoin, Latin America’s crypto giant, will tokenize over $200 million in permissioned real-world assets (RWAs), including fixed income and equity instruments, on the XRP Ledger. The move is part of Mercado Bitcoin’s broader push to expand beyond Brazil, using tokenized financial instruments as a bridge into international markets. According to Ripple, it represents one of the most significant institutional deployments of regulated assets on XRPL to date, positioning Mercado Bitcoin at the forefront of blockchain’s collision with traditional finance. You might also like: Ondo Finance to acquire SEC-regulated broker-dealer Oasis Pro Mercado Bitcoin’s institutional-grade tokenization play Mercado Bitcoin’s decision to tokenize $200 million in permissioned fixed income and equity products on the XRP Ledger is a calculated effort to position the exchange as a gateway between local financial markets and global capital networks. By leveraging XRPL’s infrastructure, Mercado Bitcoin is bypassing the walled gardens of traditional finance, opting instead to issue real-world assets directly on a public blockchain built with institutional use in mind. XRPL’s design for financial settlement, with near-instant finality and negligible fees, makes it a natural fit for regulated assets. But more importantly, its decade-long operational history, processing over 3.3 billion transactions without a single breach, gives institutional players the confidence to move real-world value onchain. Silvio Pegado, Ripple’s Managing Director for LATAM, put it succinctly: “Mercado Bitcoin’s integration with the XRPL shows how public blockchain infrastructure is being trusted by institutions and is becoming a reliable foundation for bringing regulated financial products to the market,” Pegado said. That trust isn’t theoretical. According to the press release, over 70 central banks, regulators, and financial institutions already interact with networks connected to MB’s ecosystem, signaling a quiet but seismic institutional pivot toward blockchain-based finance. The numbers back the momentum. A 2025 Ripple and Boston Consulting Group report projects the tokenized asset market will surge from $0.6 trillion today to $19 trillion by 2033, a potential 30x increase in less than a decade, with Mercado Bitcoin likely leading the charge alongside TradFi giants pivoting to RWAs. The platform has already tokenized over R$1 billion in private credit assets with zero defaults, earning its place among the world’s top five RWA tokenizers. Its ongoing work with Ripple, including cross-border treasury flows between Brazil and Portugal and the listing of the RLUSD stablecoin, demonstrates a deliberate shift toward blockchain-powered financial infrastructure.

2025-07-04T16:33:24,"Bitmine Rockets 3,000%: Crypto Mining Stocks Lead 2025 Surge","In a stunning week for crypto equities, Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) stole the headlines with a jaw-dropping 3,000% spike following news of a $250 million private placement to build an Ethereum (ETH) treasury. Bitmine official Twitter update on Q1 2025 revenue and mining capacity expansion: ”$BMNR reports a 135% revenue increase YOY for Q1 2025 and tripled self-mining capacity with 3,000 new miners!” This bold move from Bitcoin mining to an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy at the hands of Fundstrat's Tom Lee as new chairman has been drawing investors' eyes and sending Bitmine's stock from around $4.50 to over $135 in days. The surge is one of a broader crypto mining stocks rally throughout 2025, which as a group have outperformed Bitcoin and traditional assets. Crypto stocks have surged 119% year to date, with miners like Riot Platforms, Hive Digital, Hut 8, MARA Holdings, and Bitfarms posting double-digit returns of 13% to 28% in recent sessions, as per recent news. The rally has been driven by encouraging macroeconomic trends, such as the improved-than-expected U.S. job growth, which has supported risk-on mood in the equity markets. Ethereum Treasury Strategy: The Catalyst Behind Bitmine's Meteoric Rise Bitmine's devotion of its treasury nearly wholly to Ethereum is a strategic decision in accordance with growing institutional demand for ETH as a hold asset for reserve purposes. Its $250 million fundraise assembled crypto heavyweight investors in the guise of Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, and Kraken. Bitmine is attempting to mimic MicroStrategy's Bitcoin treasury strategy but in Ethereum, claiming proxy status for public exposure to ETH. This move is part of a broader trend of companies placing Ethereum in their treasury strategies, driven by the rise in stablecoins, tokenization, and fresh DeFi use cases. Institutional ETH holding reached all-time highs, with wallets holding over 22 million ETH through June 2025, up 36% in one month. Mining Stocks vs. Bitcoin While Bitcoin mining stocks historically have tracked Bitcoin price action, 2025 has seen them beating Bitcoin itself, anticipating adoption and profitability optimism in digital assets. The VanEck Digital Transformation ETF, which tracks cryptocurrency-related companies including miners, has gained more than 20% year-to-date. Bitcoin's hashprice — the revenue miners earn per unit of computational capacity — also increased recently, rising nearly 10% to approximately $58 per PH/s/day, which indicates better mining economics with rising Bitcoin prices and network changes. The improvement adds validity to valuations of mining shares but also highlights the industry's underlying volatility. What Investors Should Watch While the euphoria grips, analysts are warning against caution. Bitmine's rally is a reminder of Sharplink Gaming's earlier spike and subsequent fall, whose shares also fell precipitously after insiders sold out. The speculative nature of crypto equities and the price volatility mean that investors must scrutinize fundamentals and market conditions before riding gains. This crypto mining stock rally, led by Bitmine's historic 3,000% jump, signals an active transformation in the manner in which mining companies and investors are queueing up for the emerging crypto market in 2025. While there may be vast upside potential, the whiplash volatility and speculation risks call for guardedly strategic approach as the sector keeps unfolding.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9810/bitmine-rockets-3-000-crypto-mining-stocks-lead-2025-surge,"MINING|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Accordingly, the head of the Central Bank of Russia announced that he does not plan to include Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as reserve assets. Elvira Nabiullina stated that due to the volatility and risks of cryptocurrencies, she does not consider including them in the reserve and keeping them. “When we consider our attitude towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as risky and volatile assets, we, as a central bank, absolutely do not consider investing in them. Because cryptocurrencies are quite volatile and risky. We continue to oppose the use of cryptocurrencies in payments within the country. We say 'yes' for foreign economic activity, and 'yes' for qualified investors, especially as an investment target. In other words, we are not against their use in foreign economic activities, especially those that are considered investment vehicles. However, we are still against using them as a means of payment.” At this point, Russia continues to oppose the use of cryptocurrencies, which are not yet properly regulated, as a means of payment domestically, while only allowing qualified investors to hold cryptocurrencies for investment purposes and cross-border exchange users to access them. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T16:16:01,"Early Bitcoin Buyer Turns $7,800 into $1 Billion – Here’s What Happened","An early Bitcoin wallet that had been dormant for over 14 years suddenly came back to life this week, transferring all 10,000 BTC , now worth $1.09 billion, in a single transaction. The wallet first acquired these coins on April 3, 2011, when Bitcoin traded at just $0.78 per token, representing a staggering 140,000x return that transforms a modest $7,800 investment into millions. On-chain analyst from Lookonchain identified the massive movement, noting that the entire balance was transferred to an unknown wallet address without any test transactions. Another wallet of this Bitcoin OG also transferred out 10,000 $BTC ($1.09B) just now after being dormant for 14+ years. 14 years ago, $BTC was only $0.78 — that’s a mind-blowing 140,000x return! https://t.co/e2m8AunEMc https://t.co/G0YXqPi4mK pic.twitter.com/E1fgGlYA4u — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 4, 2025 No confirmed exchange activity has been detected yet, leaving the community to speculate whether this may be an actual sale, an internal custody transfer, or an estate management decision. When Sleeping Giants Awaken The April 2011 acquisition date places this investor among Bitcoin’s earliest adopters, as the wallet was purchased during an era when the cryptocurrency had only recently broken above $1 for the first time. For 14 years, these coins remained untouched as Bitcoin evolved from a digital curiosity to an institutional asset class, surviving multiple boom-bust cycles, regulatory crackdowns, and technological upgrades. Similar whale awakenings have become increasingly common, with another wallet moving $252 million after eight years of dormancy, while separate dormant addresses have transferred 2,000 BTC after 14 years of inactivity. $250M BITCOIN WHALE WAKES UP AFTER 8 YEARS A Bitcoin Whale that has held BTC since late 2016 has just moved over $250M in BTC last night. His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today – and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years. pic.twitter.com/RF1aewYVgy — Arkham (@arkham) March 22, 2025 Arkham Intelligence recently reported that another major whale sold 11,400 BTC, securing 2,400 BTC in gains, and bringing their total holdings to over 15,000 BTC, valued at $1.3 billion. Multiple factors could drive such movements. However, the community is primarily speculating about personal liquidity needs, estate planning, or transfers to institutional custodians seeking professional management. The complete absence of test transactions stands out as particularly unusual, since most users moving large amounts typically send small amounts first to verify wallet addresses before committing billions. Traders often interpret these movements as potential sell signals, though many whale transfers ultimately prove to be custody changes rather than liquidations. The Great Bitcoin Handoff This whale awakening coincides with a fundamental shift in Bitcoin’s ownership structure, as anonymous early holders gradually transfer coins to institutional players through ETFs, corporate treasuries, and emerging sovereign reserve strategies. Bloomberg data shows that over the past year, large holders have offloaded more than 500,000 Bitcoin worth over $50 billion, roughly matching the net inflows into US exchange-traded funds. Recent data suggest that Bitcoin’s traditional whale dominance may be permanently shifting as the market matures into a more structured institutional environment, one that controls approximately a quarter of all Bitcoin in circulation. CryptoQuant data also shows that long-term holders have accumulated over 635,000 BTC since January, while short-term holders have sold more than 460,000 BTC. Bitcoin long-term holders accumulate 635K BTC since January as traders double down on bullish options strategies, signaling confidence amid $94K volatility. #Bitcoin #CryptoMarkets https://t.co/meN9eNz0WJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 24, 2025 President Trump’s recent executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve adds another institutional layer. However, the initial market reaction proved disappointing, as the reserve will be capitalized primarily by existing government holdings. State-level adoption varies dramatically, with 26 states introducing 47 bills to establish Bitcoin reserves. Among them, Connecticut has recently moved in the opposite direction by signing comprehensive legislation that bans state digital asset investments. Notably, the shift from anonymous whales to institutional allocators may help sustain current market dynamics for years, creating what 10x Research CEO Markus Thielen calls “ more of a slow grind, where Bitcoin becomes more of a 10%-20% asset. “ The post Early Bitcoin Buyer Turns $7,800 into $1 Billion – Here’s What Happened appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/early-bitcoin-buyer-turns-7800-into-1-billion-heres-what-happened/,"BTC|ZRX|MARKET|FIAT|ARKM","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Whale",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T16:10:04,"Bitcoin’s Curious Climb: Unpacking $920M Weekly Outflows","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Curious Climb: Unpacking $920M Weekly Outflows Have you ever wondered what happens when a cryptocurrency’s price rises, but a significant amount of it seems to be leaving exchanges? This intriguing paradox is currently playing out with Bitcoin , and it’s a trend that demands our attention. Recent data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) highlights a fascinating shift: Bitcoin has recorded its fifth consecutive week of net outflows from exchanges, totaling a staggering $920 million, even as its price continues to climb. Understanding Bitcoin Weekly Outflows : A Deeper Dive When we talk about Bitcoin weekly outflows from exchanges, it refers to more BTC being moved off centralized trading platforms than is being deposited onto them. This metric is often seen as a bullish signal, as it suggests that holders are moving their assets into cold storage or long-term custody, indicating a reduced immediate selling pressure. Sentora’s report on X confirmed this persistent trend, marking five straight weeks where the net flow of Bitcoin from exchanges has been negative. Consider the recent statistics: Net Outflow: -$920 million Consecutive Weeks: 5th straight week of net outflows Bitcoin Price Action: Rose to $109,582 (+2.0%) Total Fees: Increased to $3.86 million (+13.8%) This data presents a compelling narrative: despite the substantial amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges, the asset’s value is appreciating. This divergence points to underlying market dynamics that are reshaping how we perceive supply and demand in the crypto space. The Spot ETF Effect: Driving Exchange Flows So, what’s driving these significant exchange flows ? The primary culprit, or rather, the primary catalyst, is the growing influence of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These investment vehicles allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. When investors buy shares in a spot ETF, the fund managers acquire actual Bitcoin to back those shares. This Bitcoin is then moved from active trading exchanges into secure, institutional-grade custody solutions. Here’s how spot ETFs impact exchange flows: Institutional Demand: Spot ETFs provide a regulated and accessible pathway for large institutions and retail investors alike to invest in Bitcoin. This new wave of demand requires substantial BTC acquisition by ETF issuers. Custodial Transfer: Once acquired, this Bitcoin is typically moved off the exchanges where it was traded and into cold storage or dedicated custodial wallets managed by the ETF provider’s custodians. This process registers as an ‘outflow’ from the general exchange pool. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: As more Bitcoin is locked up in ETFs, the available supply on exchanges for immediate trading decreases. This reduction in accessible supply, combined with steady or increasing demand, can contribute to upward price pressure. The emergence of spot ETFs in major markets has fundamentally altered the supply-demand equilibrium, pulling Bitcoin away from liquid trading venues and into long-term holdings, often by entities with a ‘buy and hold’ strategy. Is Bitcoin’s Price Climb Sustainable? The crucial question for many investors is whether Bitcoin’s price climb , fueled by these dynamics, is sustainable. The ongoing outflows from exchanges, largely attributed to spot ETF accumulation, suggest a structural shift in Bitcoin’s market. Instead of being held on exchanges for speculative trading, a significant portion is moving into long-term investment vehicles. This trend indicates a maturing asset class. Institutional adoption via ETFs lends credibility and stability to Bitcoin, attracting a broader investor base. The increase in total fees to $3.86 million (+13.8%) also signals robust network activity, which can be a positive indicator of utility and demand beyond just price speculation. However, it’s essential to consider potential challenges: ETF Volatility: While ETFs bring stability, large redemptions from ETFs could lead to significant selling pressure on the underlying asset. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events can still heavily influence Bitcoin’s price. Regulatory Landscape: Changes in regulations pertaining to cryptocurrencies or ETFs could impact market sentiment and flows. Despite these considerations, the current trend of outflows amidst a rising price suggests a healthy demand side, with new capital entering the market through regulated channels, effectively reducing the liquid supply available for immediate sale. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors Understanding these complex exchange flows offers valuable insights for both seasoned and new investors. Here are some actionable takeaways: Benefits: Increased Institutional Adoption: The strong inflows into spot ETFs signify growing confidence from traditional finance in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset. Reduced Selling Pressure: Less Bitcoin on exchanges generally means less immediate supply available for sale, which can be supportive of prices. Market Maturation: The shift from purely speculative trading to long-term institutional holding suggests Bitcoin is evolving into a more mature investment asset. Challenges: Interpreting Data: While outflows are generally bullish, it’s crucial to understand the underlying reasons (e.g., ETF accumulation vs. individual self-custody) to avoid misinterpretations. Concentration Risk: A significant portion of Bitcoin moving into a few large ETF custodians could, in theory, present new forms of centralization risks, though this is debated. Actionable Insights: For investors, this trend underscores the importance of a long-term perspective. The demand driven by spot ETFs is a powerful force, potentially setting a higher floor for Bitcoin’s price climb . Diversifying your portfolio and staying informed about these fundamental shifts, rather than just daily price fluctuations, is key. Consider the following market snapshot based on the Sentora data: Metric Value Change (Weekly) Net Exchange Flow -$920 Million 5th Straight Outflow Week Bitcoin Price $109,582 +2.0% Total Fees $3.86 Million +13.8% Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin’s Market Dynamics The narrative of Bitcoin’s curious climb , marked by substantial weekly outflows from exchanges despite its appreciating value, paints a vivid picture of a market in transition. The advent and success of spot ETFs are fundamentally altering Bitcoin exchange flows , pulling the digital asset into the mainstream financial ecosystem. This shift, driven by institutional demand and long-term accumulation, suggests a robust underlying demand for Bitcoin that extends beyond short-term speculation. As Bitcoin continues to mature, understanding these complex dynamics will be crucial for anyone looking to navigate the evolving crypto landscape.

According to Lookonchain, two Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallets dating back to 2011 sprang to life and transferred 20,000 BTC each, as a Satoshi-era holder emerged from long-term hibernation to move billions of dollars’ worth of the benchmark cryptocurrency. Movement of coins dating back to the days of Satoshi Nakamoto has happened over the years. Bitcoin whale wakes up after 14 years The two reactivated wallets were part of a broader group of eight wallets that, according to on-chain data, are controlled by an early adopter who acquired their BTC in 2011, well before Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. Lookonchain reported that two of these addresses received Bitcoin in April 2011, when prices hovered around $0.78. The remaining six started holding from May 2011, when BTC traded at approximately $3.37. These holdings remained untouched for over 14 years. The original value of coins in the first two addresses totaled roughly $15,600 and is now valued at over $2.18 billion. The other six wallets have seen their combined holdings grow from $202,000 to more than $6.5 billion.

Two of these transactions were of 40,000 BTC worth about $4.35 billion, on-chain data showed. The transfers began late Thursday night and Lookonchain provided an update showing all eight wallets had reactivated and transferred out 80,009 BTC. At Bitcoin’s staggering prices, these coins are worth about $8.69 billion. According to CryptoQuant , the movement of these Satoshi-era Bitcoin marks the largest single-day movement for coins over a decade old. Rather than sent to exchanges, the transfers were to other unknown addresses, suggesting potential reallocation. However, the holders could also be eyeing other outcomes, including a possible sale as BTC looks to break to new highs.

According to a release, Adecoagro will set aside part of its 230 MW renewable energy capacity for crypto mining. This move aims to give the firm a more steady outlet for surplus electricity and offer Tether a fresh, green mining site. Energy And Bitcoin Join Forces According to Adecoagro CEO Mariano Bosch, the company wants to stabilize a slice of its power sales by swapping spot‑market swings for a fixed demand channel. The idea is simple. When wind or solar output tops what the grid can use, instead of cutting back, the extra juice will fire up Bitcoin rigs. That should help Adecoagro lock in prices and turn idle electrons into potential upside if Bitcoin climbs.

The project aims to integrate mining with sustainable… pic.twitter.com/OjSqD8LXOZ — Atlas21 (@Atlas21_news) July 3, 2025 Tether Mining OS Goes Open Based on reports , Tether isn’t just writing checks. The company will install and manage the mining hardware with its own site‑management software, Tether Mining OS. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, said the system will be open‑sourced soon. Mining farms from Europe to Asia could download the code, tweak it, and run cleaner operations. That push for transparency is a way to show critics that crypto mining can fit into a low‑carbon world. Governance And Oversight Since Juan Sartori sits both as Tether’s Head of Business Initiatives and Adecoagro’s board chair, an independent committee had to sign off on the deal. Reports have disclosed that the group reviewed the terms to make sure neither side got an unfair edge. That extra check helps guard against conflicts in related‑party transactions and keeps investors on board. For Adecoagro, the math is straightforward. Every megawatt not sold cheaply during midday solar peaks could instead crank out Bitcoin rewards. Right now, the company could direct dozens of megawatts toward mining, and still feed enough power back to farms and towns. If Bitcoin holds above key levels, those mining profits may outpace selling on the spot market. Tether sees more than energy value. The firm has been growing its footprint of sustainable mines in North America and Europe already. This partnership adds South America to the list. Paolo Ardoino said it also serves as a blueprint: tap cheap green energy, run it through smart software, and share the results with the industry.

2025-07-04T16:00:19,"Bitcoin Breakout Is A Trap—Analyst Predicts Pain Before $160,000 Surge","Bitcoin may be breaking out—but don’t celebrate yet. Crypto analyst Cristian Chifoi warns that the current move is a deceptive setup likely to trap bullish traders before Bitcoin eventually surges toward $160,000. In his latest YouTube video titled “Bitcoin is breaking out! But why is it bad?”, Chifoi dismantles the optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s recent price action, arguing that this rally is not the start of a true bull run, but a temporary fakeout designed to mislead. Don’t Trust The Bitcoin Pump “From a technical standpoint, this could mean a real breakout, retest, and then continuation,” Chifoi admits. “But in my opinion, this is a false breakout which can get to a new shallow all-time high, maybe $113,000, maybe $120,000 until something like July 10 to 12—then we come back in this channel before July 20.” His thesis hinges on Bitcoin seasonality, a pattern he has explored in earlier videos, which suggests the real macro pivot will only arrive later in the month. “I’m more bullish from July 20 into the start of September,” he says. Related Reading: Bitcoin Latest Rally Backed By Stronger Purchasing Power: Report Chifoi argues that retail traders are likely to pile in during the breakout retest phase, only to be shaken out as market makers use the liquidity to reverse the trend. “The majority of retail traders would go long here on a retest. The market makers will get their money,” he warns, predicting a trap that could drag Bitcoin down to levels near $97,000 before the real uptrend resumes. His analysis extends beyond simple technicals. Chifoi points to macroeconomic sentiment and Fed policy as crucial context, particularly emphasizing that rate cuts would actually be a bearish signal—not bullish as commonly believed. “Rate cuts this year would not be bullish at all,” he insists. “It’s not Powell who decides, it’s the bond market who decides when the rate cuts should come… and when that is happening, it’s because they need to panic cut.” Chifoi stresses that the best-case scenario for bulls is actually no rate cuts, at least for now. “Just keep the rates at 4.5% maybe until year end. If this happens, I’m 100% sure that the market will go higher and higher before this starts to happen.” Related Reading: Buy Bitcoin Before Jackson Hole—Or Regret It Forever, Says Arthur Hayes Beyond Bitcoin, Chifoi forecasts a synchronized move across the broader crypto market once the July 20 pivot takes place. He highlights Ethereum, XRP, DeFi tokens like CRV, and ISO-compliant coins such as IOTA, ADA, and Quant as potential beneficiaries. “Bitcoin would drag all the crypto space with it,” he says, adding that older players like Filecoin and Polkadot could also catch a bid. Mid-Term Price Target Looking further ahead, Chifoi describes the coming period as a “stablecoin super cycle,” with DeFi projects and yield-generating protocols positioned to gain the most from Wall Street’s hunger for yield. “In crypto, only DeFi projects get you yields,” he explains. “Wall Street is boiling up for yields.” He also reaffirms his macro thesis that the current financial system is on track to be replaced, likening the transition to the 1930s move from gold to fiat. “After 100 years of this exact system, this should be replaced by another system with liquidity in it,” he says, envisioning a cryptographic banking future. Despite the short-term turbulence he expects, Chifoi remains long-term bullish. His price target of $160,000 for Bitcoin by early September reflects a belief in accelerated expansion—fueled by seasonality, delayed policy pivots, and broader adoption. In closing, Chifoi reminds his audience to zoom out and trust the high time frame signals. Referencing Bollinger Bands on the two-month chart, he notes the beginning of another expansion phase similar to late 2020. “After that, the bear market begins,” he cautions. But until then, the ride could be fast—and extremely volatile. “The next time we cut [rates], it is a big deal and something is wrong,” he concludes. “For now, we just want the cuts going higher for longer.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,848.

2025-07-04T16:00:04,"Hilbert Group Unveils Groundbreaking Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","BitcoinWorld Hilbert Group Unveils Groundbreaking Bitcoin Treasury Strategy In a move that signals a growing confidence in the digital asset space, Nasdaq-listed Hilbert Group, a prominent digital asset investment firm, has announced a groundbreaking strategic crypto treasury plan. This bold initiative designates Bitcoin (BTC) as its primary reserve asset, marking a significant step for institutional adoption within the cryptocurrency landscape. What does this mean for the future of corporate finance, and why is a firm like Hilbert Group making such a pivotal shift? Unpacking Hilbert Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The core of Hilbert Group’s announcement, detailed in a press release via ACCESS Newswire, revolves around its newly formalized Bitcoin treasury strategy . This isn’t just a casual allocation; it’s a meticulously planned and strategically overseen initiative. To ensure robust governance and expert guidance, a dedicated Treasury Committee has been established. This committee will be chaired by Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Russell Thompson, indicating a high level of commitment and expertise guiding the firm’s foray deeper into Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset. This decision by Hilbert Group underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking companies: recognizing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. For a publicly traded entity, such a move requires careful consideration of risk management, shareholder value, and long-term strategic vision. It reflects a maturing perspective on digital assets within traditional financial structures. Why a Nasdaq-Listed Firm Embraces Digital Asset Investment? The question on many minds is, why now? Why would a Nasdaq-listed firm like Hilbert Group commit to such a significant digital asset investment strategy? The answer lies in a confluence of macroeconomic factors and the evolving understanding of Bitcoin’s unique properties. Here are some key drivers: Inflationary Concerns: With global economies facing persistent inflationary pressures, traditional fiat currencies are seeing their purchasing power erode. Bitcoin, with its capped supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly viewed as a robust hedge against inflation, akin to digital gold. Long-Term Value Proposition: Many institutions now see Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, appreciating its potential for significant capital appreciation over time, driven by network effects, increasing adoption, and its scarcity. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury provides diversification away from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns in a volatile market environment. Pioneering Position: For a firm specializing in digital assets, leading by example reinforces its expertise and commitment to the sector, potentially attracting more clients and investment opportunities. This strategic pivot is not just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about integrating it into the very fabric of the company’s financial operations, signaling a deep conviction in the asset’s future role. The Rise of the Corporate Crypto Treasury Plan Hilbert Group is certainly not the first to explore a crypto treasury plan , but its position as a Nasdaq-listed entity specializing in digital assets gives its move particular weight. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously led the charge, accumulating substantial Bitcoin holdings and inspiring others to follow suit. While MicroStrategy’s strategy has been aggressive, Hilbert Group’s approach appears to be a more measured, yet equally significant, integration into its core financial strategy. The trend of companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets is gaining momentum globally. What began as a niche interest has evolved into a serious consideration for corporate finance departments looking to optimize their capital allocation and manage risk in an unpredictable economic climate. This shift highlights a growing institutional comfort with the volatility and regulatory complexities often associated with cryptocurrencies, recognizing the potential rewards outweigh the perceived risks for a long-term horizon. Benefits and Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Embracing a Bitcoin treasury strategy comes with distinct advantages and challenges: Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Protects purchasing power against fiat currency debasement. Potential for Appreciation: Offers significant upside potential as Bitcoin’s adoption grows. Enhanced Shareholder Value: Can signal innovation and foresight to investors. Diversification: Adds a non-correlated asset to the balance sheet. Industry Leadership: Positions the company as a leader in the digital asset space. Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting balance sheet valuations. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential risks. Accounting Complexities: Managing and reporting crypto assets can be complex under current accounting standards. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of digital assets requires robust cybersecurity measures. Public Perception: Some traditional investors may still view crypto as too risky. Despite these challenges, Hilbert Group’s decision reflects a calculated risk-reward assessment, betting on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Asset Investment and Institutional Adoption? The move by Hilbert Group serves as a powerful testament to the increasing legitimacy and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, within the institutional financial world. As more Nasdaq-listed companies and other public entities explore or implement similar strategies, it creates a positive feedback loop, further solidifying Bitcoin’s role as a global reserve asset. This trend is likely to accelerate the development of more sophisticated financial products and services tailored for institutional crypto adoption, from secure custody solutions to specialized lending and hedging instruments. It also puts pressure on regulators to provide clearer guidelines, fostering a more stable and predictable environment for corporate crypto treasury plans. Ultimately, Hilbert Group’s strategic decision is more than just a balance sheet adjustment; it’s a statement about the future of finance. It signals a readiness to embrace innovation and leverage the potential of decentralized technologies to enhance corporate value in the long run. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Corporate Finance Hilbert Group’s pioneering Bitcoin treasury strategy marks a significant milestone in the journey of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance. By making Bitcoin its primary reserve asset, this Nasdaq-listed firm is not only demonstrating confidence in the leading cryptocurrency but also setting a precedent for other institutions contemplating a similar digital asset investment . This bold crypto treasury plan , overseen by a dedicated committee, highlights a growing understanding that digital assets are no longer just for early adopters but are becoming a vital component of a forward-thinking corporate financial strategy. As the digital economy continues to evolve, moves like Hilbert Group’s will undoubtedly shape the future landscape of corporate balance sheets and global finance.

2025-07-04T15:57:37,"Bank of Canada Identifies Technical Path for Retail CBDC in New Research Paper","The Bank of Canada took a significant step in exploring the technical feasibility of a digital Canadian dollar, proposing a specific system designed for a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) focused on simple, everyday payments, according to a new research paper . The central bank’s research team examined OpenCBDC 2PC, a model developed in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Digital Currency Initiative. This design prioritizes privacy, speed and decentralization by allowing users to hold digital funds directly, much like digital cash. The new research comes after the Bank of Canada said it is shifting its focus away from a retail CBDC last year , saying that it was prepared if the people of the nation decide such a product is needed in the future. Privacy issues A major focus of the report is privacy, which isn't a big surprise because CBDCs have sparked debate around the world, in part on concerns they could enable state surveillance of financial activity. Unlike cash, which is anonymous, a CBDC could theoretically allow a central authority to track every transaction. The report suggested that the system separates personal identity from transaction data, allowing non-registered users to hold funds in self-custodied wallets. The users could then transact without sharing their identity with a bank or payment processor. Even for registered users, the central bank would not have access to identifying information or transaction histories. The report goes further, proposing enhanced protection by potentially using cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs to obscure transaction amounts from the core infrastructure. These features collectively offer a level of privacy that the authors say could exceed that of current electronic payment systems. Bitcoin-like structure In contrast to traditional banking systems, where money is stored in user accounts, the report suggests a design that uses ""unspent transaction outputs"" (UTXOs) — a structure more commonly associated with Bitcoin. The system processes transactions in two steps: updating a core ledger and transferring funds from one user’s wallet to another. This approach supports real-time settlement and offers a higher degree of privacy from both banks and government institutions. Challenges While the report lays out a detailed technical solution to a potential digital Canadian dollar, it also identifies potential hurdles. One of the main hurdles is that integrating the proposed architecture with existing retail payment infrastructure could require substantial technical upgrades, including in the way point-of-sale terminals handle digital cash-like transfers. Additionally, while the system is scalable in theory, performance dips during audits and system recovery operations need further engineering work to meet production-grade standards. The paper clearly states that this is not a commitment to launch a CBDC. However, the findings lay out a concrete technical foundation for what such a system could look like— one that balances user privacy, institutional control, and operational resilience.

2025-07-04T15:50:12,"Lorenzo Protocol: Pioneering USD1+ Fund Debuts on BNB Chain Testnet","BitcoinWorld Lorenzo Protocol: Pioneering USD1+ Fund Debuts on BNB Chain Testnet The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, with innovation driving new possibilities for asset utilization. A significant stride in this direction comes from Lorenzo Protocol , a pioneering platform dedicated to enhancing Bitcoin’s utility. Their recent deployment of the groundbreaking USD1+ fund on the BNB Chain testnet marks a pivotal moment, signaling a new era for Bitcoin liquidity and on-chain fund finance. This move promises to unlock unprecedented opportunities for yield generation within the Bitcoin ecosystem, merging traditional finance with the dynamic world of decentralized finance. What is Lorenzo Protocol and Its Vision for Bitcoin Liquidity? Lorenzo Protocol is not just another DeFi project; it’s a dedicated Bitcoin liquidity finance platform designed to unlock the immense potential of Bitcoin beyond its role as a mere store of value. For years, Bitcoin has been the king of cryptocurrencies, but its native blockchain isn’t inherently designed for complex decentralized applications. This has led to solutions like wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) to bring BTC liquidity to other chains, but Lorenzo Protocol aims for a more native, efficient approach to leverage Bitcoin’s power. The core vision of Lorenzo Protocol revolves around creating a robust infrastructure that allows Bitcoin holders to participate in various yield-generating activities directly, without necessarily moving their assets off the Bitcoin network or relying solely on wrapped versions. By focusing on “Bitcoin liquidity,” Lorenzo seeks to build bridges that allow BTC to flow seamlessly into diverse financial instruments and strategies, ultimately enhancing its utility and appeal for a broader range of investors. This initiative is crucial for the burgeoning BTCFi (Bitcoin Finance) ecosystem, aiming to provide a comprehensive suite of financial services built directly on or around Bitcoin. Key Aspects of Lorenzo Protocol’s Vision: Unlocking Dormant Capital: Billions of dollars in Bitcoin sit idle. Lorenzo aims to put this capital to work. Native Bitcoin Integration: Developing solutions that are as close to native Bitcoin interaction as possible, reducing reliance on centralized custodians or complex wrapping mechanisms. Diversified Yield Opportunities: Providing access to a variety of income streams for Bitcoin holders, moving beyond simple lending. Building BTCFi Infrastructure: Contributing to the overall growth and maturity of the Bitcoin decentralized finance ecosystem. Decoding the Revolutionary USD1+ Fund At the heart of Lorenzo Protocol’s latest announcement is the USD1+ on-chain traded fund (OTF) . This isn’t your average crypto fund; it represents a novel approach to combining diverse income streams into a single, transparent, and accessible investment vehicle. Backed by World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin, the USD1+ fund is engineered to provide stable returns by diversifying its strategies across multiple financial landscapes. The structure of the USD1+ fund is particularly intriguing because it draws income from three distinct yet complementary sources: Real-World Assets (RWA): This component bridges the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance. Income from RWAs could include yields generated from tokenized real estate, treasury bills, private credit, or other tangible assets that are brought onto the blockchain. This provides a layer of stability and uncorrelated returns, often appealing to investors seeking refuge from crypto volatility. Quantitative Trading Strategies: This involves sophisticated algorithms and automated systems that execute trades based on predefined rules and market analysis. These strategies can range from arbitrage and market making to trend following, aiming to generate consistent returns regardless of market direction. The “quant” aspect brings a professional, data-driven approach to fund management. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The fund also taps into the vibrant DeFi ecosystem. This could involve participating in yield farming protocols, providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), engaging in lending/borrowing protocols, or utilizing other innovative DeFi primitives to generate yield. This component offers exposure to the high-growth potential of the crypto native space. Returns generated by the USD1+ fund are paid out in USD1, a stablecoin, ensuring that investors receive their income in a predictable, non-volatile asset. This multi-faceted approach aims to create a robust and resilient fund, offering a compelling proposition for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio with a yield-generating asset that transcends typical crypto-only strategies. Why BNB Chain? The Strategic Deployment on BNB Chain Testnet The choice of BNB Chain for the deployment of the USD1+ fund ‘s testnet is a strategic one, reflecting several key advantages that the blockchain offers. A “testnet” is essentially a replica of a blockchain’s main network, designed for developers to test new features, applications, and smart contracts without risking real funds. This environment is crucial for identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and gathering community feedback before a full mainnet launch. BNB Chain , formerly Binance Smart Chain, has emerged as a formidable player in the blockchain space, known for its: High Transaction Throughput: BNB Chain can handle a large volume of transactions per second, making it efficient for dApps that require quick processing. Low Transaction Fees: Compared to some other major blockchains, BNB Chain typically offers significantly lower gas fees, making it more cost-effective for users and developers. EVM Compatibility: Being Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible means that developers can easily migrate or build dApps using familiar tools and languages (like Solidity), fostering a robust developer ecosystem. Large User Base: BNB Chain boasts a massive and active user base, thanks in part to its association with Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This provides a fertile ground for new protocols to gain traction. Deploying the USD1+ fund on the BNB Chain testnet allows Lorenzo Protocol to rigorously test the fund’s smart contracts, ensure the seamless integration of its various income-generating components, and validate its operational efficiency in a live, albeit simulated, environment. This phase is critical for ensuring the security, stability, and reliability of the USD1+ fund before it goes live on the mainnet, where real capital will be involved. The strategic choice of BNB Chain underscores Lorenzo Protocol’s commitment to accessibility, efficiency, and reaching a broad audience. The Broader Impact: Enhancing Bitcoin Liquidity and BTCFi The deployment of the USD1+ fund by Lorenzo Protocol is more than just a new product; it’s a significant step forward in the ongoing quest to enhance Bitcoin liquidity and mature the broader Bitcoin Finance (BTCFi) ecosystem. For years, Bitcoin’s primary role has been as a digital store of value, often sitting dormant in wallets. While its price appreciation has been significant, its utility within the decentralized financial landscape has been somewhat limited compared to other programmable blockchains like Ethereum. The challenge has always been how to make Bitcoin “work” in DeFi without compromising its security or decentralization. Solutions like wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) have allowed BTC to be used on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains, but these often involve custodial risks or a departure from Bitcoin’s native environment. Lorenzo Protocol, by focusing on Bitcoin liquidity finance, is aiming to create more direct and secure pathways for BTC holders to engage with yield-generating opportunities. The USD1+ fund contributes to this by: Creating a Yield-Bearing BTC-Adjacent Asset: While returns are paid in USD1, the underlying strategies aim to utilize Bitcoin or Bitcoin-derived liquidity. This allows BTC holders to indirectly benefit from diversified strategies. Showcasing Interoperability: The deployment on BNB Chain highlights the growing trend of multi-chain strategies and the need for seamless asset flow between different blockchain ecosystems. Attracting New Capital to BTCFi: By offering a professionally managed, diversified fund, Lorenzo Protocol can attract institutional and retail investors who are hesitant to directly engage with complex DeFi protocols but are keen to put their Bitcoin to work. This initiative underscores a crucial evolution in the crypto space: the transition from simply holding Bitcoin to actively leveraging it as a productive asset within a sophisticated financial ecosystem. As BTCFi continues to grow, solutions like Lorenzo Protocol’s USD1+ fund will be instrumental in unlocking trillions of dollars in dormant Bitcoin capital. The Future of Finance: Understanding the On-chain Fund Revolution The concept of an “on-chain fund” is a paradigm shift in asset management, moving away from traditional, opaque, and often costly financial structures towards a more transparent, efficient, and accessible model. The USD1+ on-chain traded fund (OTF) exemplifies this revolution, demonstrating how blockchain technology can fundamentally reshape how investment vehicles are created, managed, and accessed. What makes an on-chain fund revolutionary? Feature Traditional Fund On-chain Fund (e.g., USD1+ OTF) Transparency Limited visibility into holdings, fees, and performance. Full transparency of assets, transactions, and performance on a public ledger. Accessibility High minimum investments, geographical restrictions, accredited investor requirements. Lower barriers to entry, global accessibility, fractional ownership possible. Efficiency/Costs High management fees, numerous intermediaries, slow settlement. Automated via smart contracts, reduced fees, near-instant settlement. Liquidity Often illiquid, redemption periods. Potentially higher liquidity through tokenization and secondary markets. Composability Stand-alone, difficult to integrate with other financial products. Modular, can be integrated into other DeFi protocols and dApps. The USD1+ OTF , by operating entirely on the blockchain, eliminates many of the inefficiencies and trust requirements inherent in traditional finance. Smart contracts automate the fund’s operations, from asset allocation to return distribution, minimizing human error and potential for manipulation. This level of automation and transparency builds trust and reduces operational overhead, potentially leading to better net returns for investors. The rise of on-chain fund s signifies a broader trend towards democratizing finance. It allows individuals worldwide to access sophisticated investment strategies that were once exclusive to institutional investors. As regulations evolve and blockchain technology matures, we can expect to see more diverse and complex on-chain funds emerge, further blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance and solidifying the blockchain’s role as the infrastructure for the future of asset management. Benefits and Actionable Insights for Investors The deployment of the USD1+ fund offers several compelling benefits for various types of investors: Diversified Yield: For Bitcoin holders, this presents an opportunity to earn yield from a mix of RWA, quant strategies, and DeFi, reducing reliance on single-asset exposure. Stablecoin Returns: Receiving returns in USD1 provides predictability and stability, mitigating the volatility often associated with crypto assets. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: The RWA component offers a familiar investment avenue for traditional investors looking to dip their toes into the crypto space with a managed fund. Transparency: The on-chain nature means investors can verify transactions and fund activity, fostering greater trust. Actionable Insights: Monitor Testnet Progress: Keep an eye on Lorenzo Protocol ‘s updates regarding the testnet phase. Successful testing is a strong indicator for mainnet launch. Research USD1 Stablecoin: Understand the backing and stability mechanisms of World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin. Evaluate Risk Appetite: While diversified, all investment funds carry risk. Assess if the fund’s strategies align with your risk tolerance. Stay Informed on Regulations: The landscape for on-chain fund s and RWA is evolving. Staying updated on regulatory developments is crucial. Challenges and Considerations on the Horizon While the prospects for the USD1+ fund and Lorenzo Protocol are exciting, it’s essential to consider potential challenges: Smart Contract Risk: Despite rigorous testing, smart contracts are susceptible to bugs or exploits. Audits are crucial but not foolproof. Market Volatility: While diversified, the DeFi and quant components are still exposed to cryptocurrency market volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for on-chain fund s and RWA is still developing globally, which could impact operations. Adoption and Liquidity: The success of the fund will depend on widespread adoption and sufficient liquidity for its underlying assets and the USD1 stablecoin. Centralization Concerns: While an “on-chain fund,” the degree of decentralization in its management and governance will be a key factor for long-term sustainability. Lorenzo Protocol will need to navigate these challenges carefully, prioritizing security, transparency, and community engagement to build lasting trust and ensure the fund’s long-term viability. The Road Ahead for Lorenzo Protocol The deployment on the BNB Chain testnet is just the beginning for the USD1+ fund and Lorenzo Protocol . The next critical phase will involve comprehensive testing, gathering community feedback, and iterating on the protocol to ensure robustness and user-friendliness. Following a successful testnet period, the anticipation will build for a mainnet launch, which will allow real capital to flow into the fund. Looking further ahead, Lorenzo Protocol’s commitment to enhancing Bitcoin liquidity suggests a roadmap that could include: Integration with more blockchains to broaden accessibility. Development of additional yield-generating products tailored for Bitcoin holders. Exploring decentralized governance models for the protocol and its funds. Forging strategic partnerships within both the traditional finance and decentralized finance sectors to expand its reach and offerings. The journey of transforming Bitcoin from a dormant store of value into a dynamic, yield-generating asset is a long one, but Lorenzo Protocol is clearly positioning itself at the forefront of this evolution. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Bitcoin’s Potential Lorenzo Protocol ‘s deployment of the USD1+ fund on the BNB Chain testnet is a truly significant development, heralding a new era for Bitcoin liquidity and the broader on-chain fund landscape. By innovatively blending real-world assets, quantitative trading, and decentralized finance strategies, the USD1+ fund offers a compelling, diversified yield opportunity for investors eager to put their Bitcoin to work.

2025-07-04T15:41:52,"Solo Bitcoin miner wins full block reward of ‎3.173 BTC","A solo Bitcoin miner won the full block reward of ‎3.173 BTC using a small-scale mining rig with 2.3 petahash per second (PH/s). Mempool Space website showed that the solo miner known as Solo CK won a total of $349,028 worth of Bitcoin subsidy and fees after solving block number 903,883. The miner netted ‎3.10918096 BTC, equivalent to $338,105 after paying the pool’s fees of 0.06345267 BTC. The miner won the Bitcoin block reward through the CKpool platform while running hardware with a hashrate of 2.3 PH/s. The CKpool dev and admin, Con Kolivas, posted about the achievement of the solo miner on X and congratulated him. Source: Con Kolivas This solo miner beat incredible odds At around 2.3 PH/s, Solo CK controlled a tiny fraction of the global Bitcoin network hashrate, which ranges between 600 and 700 EH/s (exahash per second). Statistically, this translates to a ~0.004% chance per day of finding a block—which equates to Con Kolivas’ calculation of “once every 8 years” average. The log output shared by the CKpool admin on X showed that the solo miner’s rig averaged ~2.3 PH/s over the past hour and between ~2.17 to 2.22 PH/s over the past 1 to 7 days prior to solving the block. This average hashrate is considered high for a solo miner, suggesting a powerful setup roughly equivalent to the output of 10 Antminer S21 units. The log also showed that the block difficulty was at 941 trillion, and the solo miner submitted about 79.6 trillion shares (or attempts) before solving the block. This equates to 68% of the expected effort needed to solve a Bitcoin block, meaning the solo miner solved the block earlier than average. Solo miners solved many Bitcoin blocks this year This is not the first time a solo miner hits the jackpot and takes the full Bitcoin block reward. In February 2025, a solo miner solved block number 883,181 and won 3.125 BTC block, which was worth over $300,000. A Bitcoin miner said on X that the winner used an implementation of the CKPool and speculated the usage of Bitaxe. In March another solo miner solved block number 887,212 and won around 3.15 BTC, equal to $263,000 at the time. Con Kolivas shared the news on X and said the miner used a 480 GH/s Bitaxe device to solve the block with a hashrate of just 3.3 TH/s on CKpool. Such a miner has less than a 1-in-a-million chance of finding a block per day — meaning, on average, it would take about 3,500 years to discover one. Bitaxe is a DIY open-source Bitcoin miner often used by hobbyists. It’s made with a single ASIC chip , typically from the Antminer S9 series and has a hashrate of around 480 GH/s. On June 5th, a solo miner won $330,000 after mining block number 899,826 and getting 3.125 BTC. The miner obtained the block rewards through the CKpool and used a high hashrate of 259 PH/s, which is based on a rental basis from a cloud service.

The CEO of ARK Invest, known for her visionary insights into disruptive innovation, recently asserted that the Bitcoin bull run is far from over. This bold statement, shared on the ‘In the Know’ podcast and amplified across crypto news channels, signals a powerful conviction in Bitcoin’s continued ascent. For anyone tracking the volatile yet exhilarating journey of digital assets, Wood’s perspective offers a compelling reason to look beyond short-term fluctuations and embrace the larger narrative of growth. Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Truly Unstoppable, According to Cathie Wood? Cathie Wood ‘s recent remarks underscore a deep-seated belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, echoing the sentiments that have positioned ARK Invest as a prominent proponent of the leading cryptocurrency. Her statement, “We’re still in the bull market for Bitcoin,” isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a strategic outlook rooted in extensive research and a unique investment philosophy. For years, Wood has championed Bitcoin as a transformative asset, often likening it to ‘digital gold’ and a hedge against inflation. Her conviction stems from Bitcoin’s finite supply, its decentralized nature, and its growing adoption as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin operates outside the purview of central banks, offering a unique proposition in an increasingly uncertain global economic landscape. This perspective suggests that the current upward trajectory of the Bitcoin bull run is not merely a speculative frenzy but a fundamental revaluation of a revolutionary asset. What Fuels ARK Invest ‘s Enduring Optimism for Bitcoin? ARK Invest ‘s approach to Bitcoin is characterized by a forward-thinking, innovation-centric lens. Their research delves into the core drivers of Bitcoin’s value proposition, moving beyond simple price charts to understand the underlying technological and economic shifts it represents. Several key factors contribute to ARK’s sustained optimism: Scarcity and Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. Periodic ‘halving’ events, which reduce the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, create built-in scarcity, often preceding significant price appreciation. The upcoming halving in 2024 is widely anticipated as a major catalyst. Institutional Adoption: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has opened the floodgates for institutional capital, providing a regulated and accessible pathway for large investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This influx of sophisticated money is a significant legitimizing force. Network Effects and Security: As more users and developers join the Bitcoin network, its utility and security strengthen. The decentralized and robust nature of the blockchain ensures its resilience against censorship and manipulation. Disinflationary Hedge: In an era of increasing global debt and potential currency debasement, Bitcoin is viewed by ARK as a potent hedge against inflation, offering a predictable and sound monetary policy. This comprehensive view forms the bedrock of ARK Invest ‘s long-term bullish stance, distinguishing their analysis from short-term trading narratives. How is the Broader Crypto Market Influencing Bitcoin’s Trajectory? While Bitcoin often leads the charge, its performance is inextricably linked to the broader crypto market . The overall sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the digital asset ecosystem all play a role in shaping Bitcoin’s path. The current market environment is characterized by several influential trends: Market Trend Impact on Bitcoin Current Relevance Spot Bitcoin ETFs Facilitates institutional and retail investment, increasing liquidity and legitimacy. Massive inflows observed post-approval, signaling strong demand. Macroeconomic Climate Interest rate decisions, inflation data, and global stability affect risk appetite. Uncertainty can drive investors towards perceived safe-havens like Bitcoin. Technological Innovation Developments in blockchain, DeFi, and NFTs can attract new users and capital. Evolving use cases enhance the overall utility and appeal of digital assets. Regulatory Landscape Clearer regulations can foster trust and accelerate mainstream adoption. Ongoing discussions and frameworks are shaping the future of the market. The collective strength of the crypto market , driven by these interwoven factors, creates a fertile ground for Bitcoin’s continued expansion. As the ecosystem matures, Bitcoin benefits from increased infrastructure, liquidity, and broader acceptance. Beyond Speculation: What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Action? Understanding the current Bitcoin price action requires looking beyond mere speculation. While short-term trading certainly plays a role, fundamental drivers are increasingly dictating its long-term trajectory. Bitcoin’s price is a function of supply and demand, influenced by a confluence of factors: Demand from New Investors: The ease of access provided by ETFs has brought a wave of traditional investors who previously found direct crypto ownership daunting. Whale Accumulation: Large institutional holders and high-net-worth individuals continue to accumulate Bitcoin, indicating long-term confidence. Diminishing Supply: With each halving event, the rate of new Bitcoin entering the market decreases, making existing supply more valuable if demand remains constant or increases. Global Macro Trends: As central banks grapple with inflation and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as an alternative asset that can preserve purchasing power. These drivers suggest that the recent surge in Bitcoin price is not just a fleeting trend but potentially the early stages of a more sustained upward movement, consistent with Cathie Wood’s bullish outlook. What are Cathie Wood ‘s Key Insights for Navigating Bitcoin’s Volatility? While Cathie Wood is unequivocally bullish on Bitcoin, she also acknowledges the inherent volatility of disruptive assets. Her insights extend beyond simple price predictions to offer a framework for investors to navigate the often-turbulent waters of the crypto space. Key takeaways from her philosophy include: Long-Term Horizon: Wood consistently advocates for a long-term investment horizon, emphasizing that the true potential of disruptive technologies like Bitcoin is realized over years, not months. Short-term fluctuations should be viewed as noise rather than a fundamental shift in trend. Focus on Innovation: ARK Invest’s core thesis revolves around identifying and investing in innovation. For Bitcoin, this means understanding its foundational technology, its role in the future of finance, and its potential to disrupt traditional systems. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For individual investors, a strategy of dollar-cost averaging can help mitigate the impact of volatility by investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This allows investors to accumulate more Bitcoin when prices are lower. Research and Conviction: Wood stresses the importance of conducting thorough research and developing strong conviction in one’s investments. Understanding Bitcoin’s value proposition helps investors remain calm during market downturns. Her advice provides a robust framework for those looking to participate in the ongoing Bitcoin bull run , encouraging a disciplined and informed approach. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights The convergence of Cathie Wood’s optimistic forecast, ARK Invest’s rigorous research, and the evolving dynamics of the broader crypto market paints a compelling picture for Bitcoin’s future. For investors, this translates into several actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the crypto space. Consider Long-Term Allocation: If Bitcoin aligns with your investment goals, consider a strategic, long-term allocation rather than attempting to time the market. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is a leader, a diversified portfolio within crypto and across asset classes can help manage risk. Security First: Always prioritize the security of your digital assets through reputable exchanges, hardware wallets, and strong authentication practices. The narrative around Bitcoin is shifting from a speculative gamble to a legitimate asset class with growing institutional acceptance. This evolution, strongly supported by figures like Cathie Wood, suggests that we may indeed be witnessing a sustained period of growth. A Future Forged in Digital Gold Cathie Wood ‘s unwavering confidence in the continuation of the Bitcoin bull run serves as a powerful affirmation for investors and enthusiasts alike. Her perspective, backed by the deep analytical work of ARK Invest , highlights Bitcoin’s fundamental strengths and its increasing integration into the global financial system. As the crypto market matures and new catalysts emerge, the narrative of Bitcoin as a transformative asset gains further traction. The journey of the Bitcoin price may be marked by volatility, but the long-term outlook, according to one of finance’s most astute minds, remains profoundly optimistic. We are, as Wood suggests, still very much in the midst of an exciting and potentially rewarding chapter for Bitcoin.

2025-07-04T15:22:08,"Famous Analyst Said Don't Believe Other Analysts, Announced the Date When the Bitcoin Bull Will End! ""We Only Have a Few Months! Here's Why!""","As the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) gradually approaches its previous ATH of around $111,700, it is wondered whether it can maintain this upward momentum. At this point, some analysts state that the recent movements in BTC indicate an accumulation phase before the rise, while some analysts argue that BTC has peaked and the bull will end. One of these analysts was Rekt Capital. Rekt Capital said in its latest analysis that Bitcoin's rise and bull cycle could end within three months. The Bull May End in October! Crypto analyst Rekt Capital said that if Bitcoin follows a similar pattern to its 2020 cycle, there are only a few months left for the price to rise in the current bull cycle. The analyst noted that the current bull run could end within the next three months, with the cycle likely to peak this October. At this point, the analyst noted that if the Bitcoin cycle follows the 2020 pattern, the market will likely peak in October, 550 days after the Bitcoin halving in April 2024. “We potentially have two to three months left in this bull market.” This prediction from Rekt Capital contradicts other estimates suggesting that the current bull market could extend into 2026. On this point, the analyst argued that many analysts are ignoring the halving cycle and historical patterns. “Many people are happy to throw away time-tested principles, but it is really important to trust such criteria. But recently, the historically more reliable halving metric has been sidelined in favor of a new narrative like Bitcoin’s correlation with the global M2 Money Supply.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T15:14:19,"Ripple Price Analysis: $1.5 or $3 – Which Will be First for XRP This Year?","After weeks of sideways movement and declining volatility, XRP is showing signs of life once again. The recent liquidity sweep and the break of key technical levels suggest a potential shift in momentum. However, bulls still face several overhead resistances that could determine whether this is a short-term relief rally or the beginning of a more sustained uptrend. XRP Price Analysis: Technical By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair On the daily chart, XRP has bounced strongly after sweeping the sell-side liquidity below the $2 level. That sweep was followed by a strong bullish engulfing candle, signalling aggressive buying interest from that zone. The price has since reclaimed the 100-day moving average and is currently testing the 200-day MA and the descending resistance of the multi-month descending channel around $2.40. A clean breakout above this zone could open the door toward the $3 resistance cluster. If momentum continues, bulls may even eye a rally toward the major supply area near $4. However, failure to break this structure could result in another retracement back to the $1.60 demand zone. If that level breaks again without a new higher high, the structure would remain bearish. The RSI at 58 is also neutral-bullish, supporting a short-term continuation move, but not yet signalling overbought conditions. Source: TradingView The BTC Pair XRP/BTC is still trading inside the descending wedge and hasn’t confirmed a breakout yet. The pair is hovering just beneath the wedge’s upper boundary and the key resistance zone at 2100 SAT, which is just below the 100 and 200 EMAs. Despite several attempts to push higher, it has failed to break and close above this confluence. Until that happens, the downtrend structure remains intact, and the wedge is still in play. If a rejection follows, we could see another drop toward the lower boundary near 1800 SAT. Moreover, the RSI sitting around the neutral 50 level signals indecision, making a confirmed breakout or rejection crucial for the next move.

2025-07-04T15:13:03,"Why are Bitcoin and altcoins going down today?","Bitcoin and most altcoins declined on Friday, July 4, as investors booked profits, trade jitters resurfaced, and expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut diminished. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped to $107,800, retreating sharply from this week’s high of $110,200. Leading the losses among altcoins were SPX6900 ( SPX ), Ethena ( ENA ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), and Pepe ( PEPE ). Bitcoin and altcoins likely dropped because of the recent US nonfarm payrolls jobs data and their implications to the Federal Reserve. In a report on Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the economy added 147,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2%. The figures were better than the expected addition of 100,000 jobs and contrasted with the ADP report, which had indicated a loss of over 33,000 private-sector jobs. The unemployment rate was also lower than forecasts, which had projected a rise to 4.3%.

Bitcoin and other altcoins do well when there are hopes of interest rate cuts. The crypto market also pulled back as the July 7 deadline for new tariffs approached. President Donald Trump has so far reached agreements with China, Vietnam, and the UK, but deals with key trading partners including Japan, South Korea, and the European Union remain unresolved. This raises the risk of an extended trade war. Bitcoin and other crypto tokens crashed in April after the Liberation Day speech and then bounced back after Trump announced the three-month pause to allow for negotiations. Bitcoin and altcoins dropped because of the US holiday and profit-taking The U.S. Independence Day holiday also contributed to a decline in trading activity, adding to downward pressure on digital assets. According to CoinMarketCap, 24-hour trading volume fell 33% to $94.57 billion. The decline appears partly driven by profit-taking, as traders locked in gains from the recent rally. Several of the week’s best performers, including Pudgy Penguins, Bonk, Fartcoin, and Dogwifhat, were among Friday’s top laggards. Still, the ongoing retreat could be temporary since Bitcoin has strong fundamentals, with ETF demand rising and supply on exchanges falling. It has also formed a cup-and-handle and a bullish flag pattern, pointing to a rebound in the near term.

2025-07-04T15:12:52,"Bitcoin’s Breakthrough: Could BTC Price Target $120,000 by July?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Breakthrough: Could BTC Price Target $120,000 by July? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation! A bold new forecast from crypto services provider Matrixport has sent ripples across the market, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price prediction could see the leading digital asset soar to an astonishing $120,000 as early as this month. For many investors, this raises a crucial question: is this an achievable target, or just another speculative whisper in the wind? Let’s dive deep into the factors fueling this optimistic outlook and what it could mean for the future of the crypto landscape. Unpacking Matrixport’s Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction In a recent update shared on X, Matrixport, a prominent name in crypto financial services, laid out a compelling case for a significant upside movement in Bitcoin’s value. Despite sustained institutional accumulation and robust inflows into Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), BTC has largely remained within a trading range. This prolonged consolidation often tests investor patience, yet Matrixport sees it as a coiled spring, ready to unleash substantial gains. Their analysis points towards an upside potential ranging between $116,000 and a staggering $120,000. What makes this Matrixport Bitcoin prediction particularly intriguing is the specific timeline: “as early as this month.” This suggests a belief in rapid price appreciation, driven by a confluence of technical and fundamental indicators that they believe are aligning for a powerful breakout. It’s a testament to the dynamic nature of the crypto market, where periods of calm can swiftly give way to explosive volatility. Why is BTC Price Target Set So High? Key Drivers Several underlying factors contribute to Matrixport’s confident BTC price target . Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the potential trajectory of Bitcoin: Strong ETF Inflows: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has been a game-changer, opening the floodgates for traditional finance to access Bitcoin. Consistent net inflows into these products demonstrate sustained institutional demand, signaling long-term conviction in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Even during periods of sideways price action, these inflows have provided a solid demand floor. Sustained Institutional Accumulation: Beyond ETFs, various institutions, including corporations, asset managers, and even sovereign wealth funds, continue to accumulate Bitcoin. This steady accumulation removes supply from the open market, creating scarcity that can drive prices higher when demand surges. Decreased Volatility and Market Maturity: Perhaps one of the most telling indicators cited by Matrixport is Bitcoin’s volatility dropping to multi-year lows. While some might interpret low volatility as a sign of stagnation, in mature markets, it often precedes significant price movements. It suggests that Bitcoin is becoming less susceptible to wild speculative swings and more aligned with traditional asset behaviors, indicating increased market maturity. This stability can attract even more conservative institutional capital. Bitcoin in July: A Historical Look at Seasonal Trends One of the fascinating aspects of Matrixport’s analysis hinges on historical patterns. The report highlights that Bitcoin July performance has historically been robust, with an impressive average return of 9.1% for the month. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, seasonal trends can sometimes offer valuable insights into market psychology and capital flows. If these historical seasonal trends hold true, and combined with the current building capital inflows, Matrixport believes Bitcoin is poised to breach crucial resistance levels. Breaking past these technical barriers, often psychological as well as chart-based, could trigger a cascade of buying interest, propelling the price towards their ambitious $116,000 to $120,000 range. It’s a scenario where history rhymes, amplified by contemporary market dynamics. Navigating the Crypto Market Analysis: Challenges & Opportunities While the prospect of Bitcoin reaching $120,000 is exciting, a balanced crypto market analysis requires acknowledging potential challenges and opportunities. No prediction is without its risks, and smart investors always consider both sides of the coin. Potential Challenges: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic factors, such as interest rate changes, inflation data, or global geopolitical events, can significantly impact investor sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory attention or unexpected policy shifts in major economies could introduce uncertainty and dampen enthusiasm. Sudden Supply Shocks: While less likely, large sell-offs from whales or unforeseen events impacting major exchanges could temporarily disrupt the market. Actionable Insights for Investors: Risk Management: Always invest only what you can afford to lose. Volatility, even when decreasing, remains a characteristic of the crypto market. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider a strategy of regular, smaller investments rather than a single large lump sum, to mitigate the impact of short-term price fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and fundamental developments. Understanding the narratives driving the market is key. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a dominant force, consider diversifying your crypto portfolio to spread risk. The Road Ahead: Will Bitcoin Break New Ground? The latest forecast from Matrixport presents a compelling narrative for Bitcoin’s near-term future. The convergence of strong institutional demand, a maturing market, and historically favorable seasonal trends paints a picture of significant upside potential. While the journey to $120,000 may encounter its share of twists and turns, the underlying fundamentals suggest that Bitcoin is indeed entering a new phase of its evolution. Whether it hits the $120,000 mark by July or takes a little longer, the discussion around such ambitious targets underscores the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these key indicators will be paramount for anyone navigating the exciting world of digital assets.

The researcher revealed on Friday that between $30 million and $40 million of the stolen funds was converted to bitcoin BTC, ether ETH and Tether's USDT through Latin American over-the-counter desks and crypto exchanges. The June 30 cyberattack on C&M Software involved a group of attackers bribing an employee into revealing their corporate credentials.

2025-07-04T15:00:00,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $0.7827 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.5823 Market Cap $21 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $677 Million Circulating Supply 45 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.6105 24-hour Low $0.5806 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.23% 50-day SMA $ 0.669534 14-Day RSI 47.74 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day chart on July 4, Cardano (ADA) is currently exhibiting bearish momentum. The price is trading below the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.6536) and nearing the lower band at $0.5829, suggesting continued downward pressure. RSI is at 33.26, approaching oversold territory, indicating weakening buyer interest. If ADA breaks below the $0.5829 support level, further decline toward the $0.55 or even $0.50 zone is possible. A short-term recovery would require a bounce above $0.6536 with increased volume and RSI climbing above 40. Overall, the trend remains bearish unless key resistance levels are reclaimed and market sentiment shows signs of reversal. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart for Cardano (ADA), the asset is exhibiting signs of weakening bullish momentum. Despite a minor price rebound toward $0.58, the Bollinger Bands are starting to narrow, indicating decreasing volatility. The MACD line is above the signal line but shows signs of convergence, hinting at potential bearish crossover if momentum fades. Additionally, the Balance of Power indicator reads -0.84, signaling dominant selling pressure in the short term. ADA must hold the $0.53 support zone to avoid deeper retracement. A confirmed breakout above $0.58 could reignite upward momentum, targeting resistance near the $0.63 level. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 0.591013 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.604081 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.586336 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.598662 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.669534 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.677483 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.612612 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 0.611091 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.635019 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.654165 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.669998 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.710588 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.747892 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.722727 SELL What to expect from Cardano price analysis next Cardano (ADA) shows mixed signals across the 4-hour and 1-day charts, reflecting cautious optimism amid prevailing bearish pressure. On the 1-day chart, ADA is trading near $0.58 with Bollinger Bands widening slightly, suggesting growing volatility, while the RSI remains below 50, indicating weak buying strength. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart shows ADA facing resistance at $0.58 with the MACD approaching a bearish crossover and a strongly negative Balance of Power, signaling selling dominance. Unless ADA breaks above $0.63 with volume support, short-term recovery remains fragile. A drop below $0.53 support could deepen the correction, while consolidation may define the near-term outlook. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $5.97, with an average trading price of about $5.17 and a minimum price of $5.03. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano will reach $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $5.97. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $7.33 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $8.61. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.5823, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano Cardano has taken a major step toward decentralized governance with the enactment of its Constitution, as highlighted in Messari’s Q1 report. The report notes active DRep participation, a 30% rise in stablecoin market cap, a 13% increase in DeFi diversity score, and a 5% growth in treasury balance (ADA).
