2025-07-04T10:43:43,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $1B Inflows in Two Days After Brief Outflow Streak","US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have rebounded sharply, recording over $1 billion in net inflows across Wednesday and Thursday after a brief setback on Tuesday that saw $342.2 million in outflows. Key Takeaways: US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a strong rebound with over $1 billion in net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC led inflows with $421 million in two days, while BlackRock’s IBIT attracted $224.5 million. Year-to-date, the ETFs have attracted $14.5 billion in net inflows. The turnaround signals renewed investor confidence, with cumulative inflows since launch approaching the $50 billion mark. According to data from Farside Investors , Wednesday brought $407.8 million in net inflows, followed by $601.8 million on Thursday. Fidelity’s FBTC Tops Bitcoin ETF Inflows With $421M Over Two Days Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge both days, adding $184 million and $237.1 million, respectively. BlackRock’s flagship IBIT fund, typically the top performer, saw an uncharacteristic pause at the start of July with two days of zero flows — its first since April — but bounced back strongly on Thursday with $224.5 million in new inflows. This week’s rally resumed the positive trend from June, when the ETFs logged a 15-day streak totaling $4.7 billion in net inflows, 81% of which flowed into BlackRock’s IBIT. Year-to-date, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have now attracted $14.5 billion in net inflows and control nearly $128 billion in assets under management, led by IBIT’s $73.6 billion. Commenting on IBIT’s explosive growth, Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, noted it has already become BlackRock’s third-highest revenue-generating ETF out of 1,197 products, surpassing even some of the firm’s flagship traditional funds. The nearly $75bil iShares Bitcoin ETF has only one month of outflows since Jan 2024 launch… Now generates more fee revenue for BlackRock than its largest ETF, the iShares S&P 500 ETF. Simply a machine. I offer a few thoughts here. via @isabelletanlee https://t.co/uDv6eiVb4b pic.twitter.com/pPwMQbfplW — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2025 Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas added that IBIT is just $9 billion away from becoming BlackRock’s top ETF by revenue. Thursday also saw the highest daily trading volume for Bitcoin ETFs since May, hitting $5.3 billion, with IBIT contributing $4.1 billion. Since their debut in January 2024, the ETFs have recorded more than $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume, highlighting their role in drawing institutional and retail investors into Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles. Analysts See 95% Odds of Solana, XRP, Litecoin ETF Approvals Last week, Balchunas and Seyffart assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. While the final deadlines for individual altcoin ETFs arrive in October, the analysts predict 90% approval odds for other tokens like Dogecoin and Cardano by year-end, but note Sui and Tron ETFs face more regulatory uncertainty with only 60% and 50% odds, respectively. In April, Balchunas revealed that more than 70 cryptocurrency ETFs are currently awaiting review by the SEC. The lineup features a broad range of digital assets beyond Bitcoin, including XRP, Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, and various crypto derivatives.

2025-07-04T10:30:09,"Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says","The wait for altcoin season continues as the crypto market is still showing signs of bearish movement. Expectations are high that the altcoin market will begin to rally soon, but not everyone is optimistic that the altcoin season is coming. One of those is market analyst and expert Stockmoney Lizards, who has said that it is not happening soon. Altcoin Season Is Not Happening Soon In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Stockmoney Lizards informed their over 160,000 followers that the altcoin season could not be happening anytime soon. The analyst said that it is “not even remotely close”, pointing to the rising Bitcoin dominance as the reason why the altcoin season is still far off. Related Reading: Analyst Says Cycle Is Not Finished Amid 2 Years Of Bitcoin Sideways Movement Analyzing the chart, the market expert explains that despite the Bitcoin dominance having fallen by around 2%, it still doesn’t mean much. This is because the dominance is still very strong and continues to trade inside the channel. This channel also charts a possible increase in the Bitcoin dominance from here, which would be detrimental for altcoins. So far, the Bitcoin dominance has also managed to hold above 65%. While this is not the highest it has ever been, it is still incredibly high, with previous altcoin seasons not happening until the dominance had fallen toward 40%. The analyst doesn’t entirely rule out the possibility of an altcoin season, saying it will still come. However, for now, Bitcoin continues to dominate, as he explains that “BTC is the measure of all things.” Altcoin Dominance Reaches 2021 Levels As the Bitcoin dominance has risen and the altcoin dominance has fallen, they have gone toward levels not seen in years. For example, the last time the Bitcoin dominance was above 65% was back in 2021 before it crashed to usher in the altcoin season, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: AI Founder Puts XRP Price As High As $20-$30 Even worse is the Ethereum dominance, which has dropped to 5-year lows. Sitting at only 8%, it is now at levels recorded back in 2020 before the market rebounded from the COVID-19 crash. This has greatly diminished Ethereum’s ability to pull the altcoin market up with it. In the same vein, the altcoin dominance, excluding Ethereum, has now dropped to 26%. The last time that the OTHERS dominance was this low was in 2021. However, this was right around when the altcoin season was starting, suggesting that the current market could be at the cusp of another altcoin run. Nevertheless, for there to be any sustainable altcoin season, the Bitcoin dominance must first crash. Going by what happened back in 2017 and 2021, at least a 40% crash in the Bitcoin dominance is required to usher in the altcoin season.

2025-07-04T10:29:33,"Google Gemini Predicts Cardano (ADA) Price for July 31, 2025","Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.5905, reflecting a 5.76% increase over the past 24 hours. Looking ahead, we asked Google’s Gemini AI to predict the digital asset’s price by July 31, 2025, and the AI model has high expectations for ADA. Gemini bases its bullish projection on several factors, most notably the ongoing crypto market cycle, Cardano’s ecosystem development and key partnerships, and growing institutional interest. The AI categorizes the prediction as a “bullish yet realistic” scenario, anchored in historical patterns and expected network growth. Cardano (ADA) Price Target Breakdown Gemini outlines three tiers of price targets within its bullish framework: Conservative Case ($1.8): This assumes that ADA will break past its 2024 highs and benefit from general altcoin market strength. Optimistic Case ($2.3): Reflects mid-cycle optimism with increased DeFi activity on the Cardano network. Aggressive Bullish Case ($3): A scenario where ADA comes close to its previous all-time high, last seen in September 2021, supported by “strong network usage and macro tailwinds.” These targets are framed around the idea that the crypto market may be entering a peak bullish phase. As Gemini notes, “2024 was a Bitcoin halving year ,” and if historical patterns hold, the 12–18 months following such events often represent the most active part of the cycle. The AI references ADA’s previous all-time high of $3.1, suggesting that a return to similar levels is plausible under favorable market conditions. Supporting Factors Gemini attributes its outlook to several key developments within the Cardano ecosystem. The platform has evolved significantly, and the decision to partner with Ripple and the XRP community has opened new doors for Cardano. Cardano’s creator, Charles Hoskinson, previously stated that RLUSD would be integrated into the ADA DeFi ecosystem . With ongoing projects launching to boost the ecosystem’s utility, ADA could experience a major price surge soon. Another supportive factor is growing institutional interest . Cardano’s academic approach and compliance-focused development make it a strong candidate for capital inflows in a more regulated environment. Gemini also noted that if crypto spot ETFs expand beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, ADA may be among the next group of assets to benefit. Bloomberg analysts recently predicted a 90% chance that spot Cardano ETFs will be approved this year , and approval as early as July could help ADA reach Gemini’s $3 target by the end of the month. ADA currently trades well below the projected bullish targets at $0.5905, but under optimal market and ecosystem conditions, it could reach the target range of $1.8 to $3 by July 31.

2025-07-04T10:28:29,"Altcoin Season Could Explode If Bitcoin Holds Above $100K","The post Altcoin Season Could Explode If Bitcoin Holds Above $100K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin spent most of Q2 moving sideways and is now retesting the key $110K resistance as Q3 kicks off. A breakout could push it toward $120K, though it may take time. Standard Chartered also expects BTC to hit $120K by August or September . However, short-term dips are still expected. Experts say $100,000 is the key level to watch this quarter. If Bitcoin holds above it, the outlook stays strong. But if it falls below, the price could drop to around $88,000, where many buyers might jump in. For now, the market seems to be gearing up for a big move, and any short-term pullbacks could be seen as a chance to buy at lower prices. Let’s see if we are hitting an alt-season or not. This Altcoin Season Is Different Looking at the possible scenarios of Q3 2025, a crypto analyst from Selected Investments urges investors to stay alert. Despite the summer lull, key macro events unfolding over the next few months could determine whether Bitcoin and altcoins push toward a final bull market top or fall short. He compared the previous cycles, wherein Bitcoin peaked roughly 525–546 days post-halving. Applying the same timeline to the April 2024 halving puts the projected top in mid-October 2025. However, the analyst warns that history alone can’t predict outcomes. Unlike past cycles, current macro conditions like tighter global liquidity and elevated interest rates create a vastly different backdrop. Global Liquidity Tight, But That Could Change Soon The analyst points to a key metric like global M2 money supply growth. Compared to the liquidity booms of 2017 and 2021, 2025 shows far more constrained conditions. Interest rates remain high, around 4.5%, but analysts now anticipate rate cuts in the coming months. July carries a 25% chance of a 25 bps cut, with probabilities rising to 71% in September and 56% in October for deeper cuts. These would likely boost market liquidity and benefit-risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. [post_titles_links postid=”478580″] Altcoins Still Quiet, But TVL Signals Underlying Strength Despite Bitcoin nearing its all-time high at $108K , the Fear and Greed Index is only at 46, indicating a lack of retail interest, a scenario that often precedes explosive moves. The analyst believes this quiet strength is a signal that the altcoin season is still ahead. Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi is nearing $115 billion, not far from the $175 billion peak in 2021, even though altcoin prices remain subdued. Ethereum’s Next Move Depends on Macro Shifts Ethereum remains rangebound around $2,500, facing key resistance. The analyst sees a potential breakout if macro conditions improve. Historically, Q4 has delivered outsized gains, with Bitcoin averaging 85% returns and Ethereum 24%. With Bitcoin dominance still high, a meaningful shift could break a full-fledged altcoin rally. In short, Q3 could be the calm before a storm, especially if rate cuts and liquidity injections align. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs What exactly is an “altcoin season” in the cryptocurrency market? An “altcoin season,” or “altseason,” is a period when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin in price growth. This typically occurs when capital rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to rapid and substantial gains across a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies, often accompanied by a decrease in Bitcoin’s market dominance. How is the crypto market doing today? As of July 4, 2025, the crypto market is showing mixed performance. Bitcoin is trading around $109,033, down slightly by 0.85% in the last 24 hours but has seen recent highs near $110,500. Ethereum is around $2,573, gaining momentum. The global crypto market cap is approximately $3.40 trillion, with some altcoins seeing minor gains (like XRP, Solana, Tron) while others experience slight declines. Institutional demand and ETF inflows continue to drive long-term bullish sentiment despite short-term volatility. What indicators suggest an “altcoin season” might still be ahead despite Bitcoin’s recent surge? Despite Bitcoin nearing its all-time high ($109,112), the Fear and Greed Index is only at 46 (Neutral), indicating a lack of retail FOMO often seen before explosive altcoin moves. Additionally, Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi is nearing its 2021 peak ($115 billion vs. $175 billion), signaling underlying strength even with subdued altcoin prices.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/altcoin-season-could-explode-if-bitcoin-holds-above-100k/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|ETH|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T10:23:05,"The House Passes Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, Sparking a July 4 Bitcoin Rally","Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill is finally here after being approved by the US Congress and reaching the president’s desk. The White House posted the news on X , celebrating a wave of coming tax cuts and a $5T larger debt capacity. With the One Big, Beautiful Bill released into the world, a lot of changes are bound to come to the financial sector and, last but not least, a long-awaited Bitcoin rally. How Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill Will Fuel the Bitcoin Fire So, when does the Big Beautiful Bill go into effect? After Trump signs it today, which means all eyes are on Bitcoin and the predicted imminent rally. Why? Because the Bill comes with several changes that are almost guaranteed to benefit Bitcoin and the crypto market in general: The rollback of clean energy government subsidies, cutting the competition for crypto miners Increased deficit spending and monetary tightening pressuring the US dollar lead investors to seek store-of-value options like Bitcoin Rise in federal debt, impacting global liquidity and forcing investors to use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation These macro pressures have benefited Bitcoin historically and a similar situation is likely to occur today. Aside from crypto enthusiasts, the Bill will also benefit a range of sectors , including manufacturers, small businesses, and the top 20% of net earning Americans, who would add $13K per year to their balance sheets. Naturally, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows, as the Bill is also likely to produce some negative effects in the long run. Short term, low-income Americans will be the most affected due to the cuts in Medicaid and food stamps. The long-term effects may be even more drastic, according to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) , with the Bill potentially increasing the budget deficit by $3.4T over the next 10 years. That’s a particularly thorny issue, especially in as the government’s net annual spending has grown more than three times in 2025 compared to 2017. Fortunately, Bitcoin might just become a solution to that, as $BTC is up 1.49% over the past 7 days and it currently sits at over $109K. And if Bitcoin is doing well, so are other projects, including some of the best crypto to buy in 2025. Here are three that might do well. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – The Telegram Sniper Bot Collecting Crypto Trophies for You Snorter Token ($SNORT) is a presale developing the Snorter Bot, a geared-up Aardvark Telegram bot that scans the market to snipe the hottest crypto tokens for you. Snorter Bot is the solution to manual coin hunting, which can be overwhelming, imprecise, and can expose you to crypto scams like honeypots and rug pulls. The Bot fixes these problems by operating in the Telegram-chat-only, centralizing its activity in one place. The bot can identify and avoid red-flagged crypto projects and send buy commands in milliseconds when the project shows liquidity. This means you can buy in at the earliest possible price, before other traders realize the token is out on the market. Which might be more than enough for that big payout you’re looking for. The project is in presale since May 2025, and has already accumulated $1.5M with a token price of $0.0971. Aside from the token’s low price, the presale also offers staking with 232% dynamic APY for extra rewards. More importantly, based on the project’s scope and roadmap , our analysts expect $SNORT to reach a price point of $0.94 post-listing, mainly driven by investor curiosity. Once the project begins to see genuine adoption and use, $SNORT could get as high as $3.25 by the end of 2030, for an ROI of 3,247% if you invest today. You can purchase your $SNORT today from the presale page (you’ll need crypto like $USDT or $ETH to buy the tokens, which you’ll receive after the presale is over). 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin’s Official Layer 2 Upgrade Offering Higher Speeds and Lower Fees Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is Bitcoin’s acclaimed Layer 2 upgrade that aims to solve Bitcoin’s most pressing issues: Subpar transaction speeds High latency for transactions, which leads to congestion Low potential for ecosystem expansion No support for dApps and smart contracts Low compatibility with DeFi technology Speed is one of the biggest problems, as Bitcoin’s max speed of 7 Transactions Per Second (TPS) is unacceptable in 2025. Base Chain, for instance, has a real-time TPS of 132.5 . That’s an almost 19x difference that Bitcoin can never hope to bridge without help. Bitcoin Hyper promises to solve this problem with two things: 1. The Canonical Bridge that streamlines transactions by storing the users’ tokens in escrow and minting the same amount on the Layer 2. 2. The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which enables near-instant, low-latency smart contract execution. These tools turn Bitcoin Hyper into a speed demon that offers near-instant transaction finality and, thus, lower network costs. $HYPER is currently in presale and has accumulated over $1.9M since it started in May, 2025. The token’s price is $0.012125 today, but our analysts expect it to reach $0.32 by the end of 2025. With enough support and following its successful implementation and performance, $HYPER could get as high as $1.5 by 2030, or even higher. This means that, in the worst case scenario, you should expect an ROI of 12,300% over the next five years. If you’re interested in the project, go to the presale page and buy $HYPER to support the project and diversify your portfolio. 3. LOBO-THE-WOLF-PUP ($LOBO) – The Official Meme Coin of the Wolf Pack LOBO-THE-WOLF-PUP ($LOBO) is the end-product of the Rune Father, which formed when Buoyant Capital won the auction of Runestone at 8 $BTC. This resulted in 112K wallets receiving a Runestone. The successful auction was then followed by the creation of Rune Doors on April 12, 2025, which rewarded holders with $LOBO; more precisely, over 72K wallets received the new token. The rest is history, with $LOBO now supporting the new Wolf Pack ecosystem and aiming to become ‘a movement within the Bitcoin ecosystem.’ $LOBO is currently hot in the charts, packing 230% over the past 7 days, with a 94% community support. If you want to become a member of the Wolf Pack, head over to your preferred exchange and get yourself some $LOBO . Is the Big Beautiful Bill the Start of a Bitcoin Rally? Based on how Bitcoin has been performing over the past seven days and the projected effects of the Big, Beautiful Bill, we should definitely expect a Bitcoin rally, starting potentially today. So, keep your eyes on the chart and don’t miss on new crypto projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which could reach new heights in 2025. Don’t take this as financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) and invest wisely.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-big-beautiful-bill-sparks-bitcoin-rally/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T10:10:17,"Two Bitcoin whales from 2011 move 20,000 BTC worth $2.81 billion","The global digital assets market recorded a minor pullback on Friday as Bitcoin was unable to hold the $109K mark. Amid this drawdown, on-chain data shows that two resting BTC whale wallets woke up and chose to move around 20,000 Bitcoin (approx. $2.18 billion). Bitcoin price is now up by 89% over the past year. This move comes in when US lawmakers prepare for a landmark legislative blitz, “Crypto Week.” The event is scheduled for July 14–18, when the House is set to review and potentially pass three key bills that could reshape the American crypto landscape. Dormant Bitcoin wallets move $2.18b+ As per the data shared by Lookonchain, one wallet (12tLs9c9Rs) first bought 10,000 BTC for a mere $7,805 back in April 2011 when Bitcoin was trading at $0.78, and moved its holding just a few hours ago. Now, that same haul is worth over $1 billion. Just moments later, a second wallet (1KbrSKrT3Ge) was caught moving another 10,000 BTC, bringing the total to $2.18 billion moved in a single morning. That’s a jaw-dropping 140,000x return on the original investment of $7,805. However, it is still not confirmed that these two wallets are linked to one person or entity. Another wallet of this Bitcoin OG also transferred out 10,000 $BTC ($1.09B) just now after being dormant for 14+ years. 14 years ago, $BTC was only $0.78 — that’s a mind-blowing 140,000x return! https://t.co/e2m8AunEMc https://t.co/G0YXqPi4mK pic.twitter.com/E1fgGlYA4u — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 4, 2025 All this comes as markets are still hesitating. Bitcoin rallied past $110,000 overnight, then pulled back to $108K levels. Despite US Bitcoin Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continuing to accumulate, corporate treasuries stacking BTC, the market seems split between bullish momentum and macro caution. Bitcoin price is up by more than 3% in the last 30 days and is trading at an average price of $108,895 at press time. The biggest crypto is just inches away from reclaiming its recently made all-time high of around $112K. GOP pushes crypto bills The timing of this on-chain event comes when Republicans are planning to bring three major crypto bills to the floor. Every investor’s eyes are on the CLARITY Act (market structure), the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the Senate’s recently passed GENIUS Act, which aims to put stablecoins under a federal regulatory framework. In a coordinated announcement on Thursday, House Financial Services Chair French Hill, Agriculture Chair Glenn “GT” Thompson, and Speaker Mike Johnson declared their intent to move forward with these acts. “House Republicans are taking decisive steps to deliver the full scope of President Trump’s digital assets and cryptocurrency agenda,” Johnson said in a statement. The push indicates the most aggressive legislative effort yet to align US crypto regulation with the GOP’s pro-business platform. This includes placing privacy, decentralization, and market freedom at the heart of the nation’s digital asset framework. Republican leaders say the goal is to make the US the crypto capital of the world, while protecting financial sovereignty in the face of growing global CBDC adoption. “This is a historic opportunity,” said Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a longtime crypto advocate. “By sending these three pieces of legislation to President Trump’s desk, we will protect Americans’ right to financial privacy.” The cumulative crypto market stood at $3.35 trillion, with the 24 hour trading volume of $109.4 billion. The stablecoin market cap is at just $264.4 billion, where Tether’s USDT is leading the race with $158.4 billion cap. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Enduring Power of Y Combinator: A Goldmine for Investors? For decades, Y Combinator has stood as a beacon of innovation, a launchpad for some of the world’s most successful companies. Its rigorous program and expansive network have consistently delivered exceptional returns to investors. Kulveer Taggar, a two-time YC alum and a figure well-versed in the startup ecosystem, underscores this potential. “If you look at the data: 6% of YC companies become unicorns, and of that 6% a quarter become decacorns,” Taggar shared with Bitcoin World. This impressive track record highlights why investment in YC-backed ventures is often seen as a strategic move. Taggar, best known for founding Zeus Living, a property management startup that secured over $150 million in funding, has channeled his confidence in YC’s continued return potential into a new venture: Phosphor Capital. This firm is uniquely dedicated solely to investing in YC companies. Since its inception last year, Phosphor Capital has successfully raised $34 million in capital across two distinct funds, signaling strong investor belief in its focused strategy. Navigating the Landscape of Venture Capital with a Unique Edge In the competitive realm of Venture Capital , differentiation is key. While Phosphor Capital is not the sole firm concentrating on YC startups—Pioneer Fund and Rebel Fund employ similar strategies—it distinguishes itself as the only dedicated YC fund led by a solo General Partner. This structure allows for streamlined decision-making and a highly personalized approach to portfolio companies. Phosphor Capital’s investment strategy involves writing checks ranging from $100,000 to $500,000, providing crucial early-stage capital to promising YC graduates. This targeted investment size enables the fund to build a diverse portfolio, mitigating risk while maximizing exposure to high-potential startups. The firm has already backed over 200 YC companies, a testament to its active engagement and rapid deployment of capital. Several of these early investments have already progressed to successfully raise Series A funding, demonstrating the efficacy of Phosphor’s selection process and support. Why Garry Tan’s Backing Signals a New Era for YC Startups A significant vote of confidence for Phosphor Capital comes from an influential figure within the YC ecosystem: Garry Tan , the current CEO of Y Combinator. Taggar’s deep and enduring relationship with YC played a pivotal role in securing Tan as an investor in the fund. Their connection dates back to 2007 when Taggar, alongside his cousin Harj Taggar and future Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, brought their startup, Auctomatic, through the accelerator program. This early experience forged a strong bond with the top accelerator. Their paths intertwined again in 2011 when Taggar returned to YC with Zeus Living. Initialized Capital, co-founded by Garry Tan, led Zeus Living’s Series A funding round and joined its board, further cementing their professional relationship. Taggar views Tan’s leadership at Y Combinator as transformative. “You could view this as a bet on Garry. I think he is taking Y Combinator to new levels,” Taggar stated, emphasizing the strategic alignment and shared vision between the two. Propelling Innovation: The Focus on AI Startups One of the most exciting areas of focus for Phosphor Capital is the burgeoning field of AI Startups . Taggar expressed particular enthusiasm for the opportunities presented by young companies leveraging artificial intelligence. The rapid advancements in AI technology are creating fertile ground for disruptive innovations across various industries, making it a prime target for early-stage investment. Phosphor Capital’s portfolio already reflects this strategic emphasis on AI. Among the over 200 YC companies it has backed, several prominent AI-driven ventures stand out. For instance, workflow automation platform Gumloop and AI meeting manager Circleback have both successfully secured Series A funding after receiving initial support from Phosphor. These examples highlight the fund’s ability to identify and nurture promising AI technologies that are poised for significant growth and impact. From Founder to Funder: A Masterclass in Startup Funding Kulveer Taggar’s journey from a two-time YC founder to a dedicated investor provides a unique perspective on Startup Funding . Unlike many emerging managers, Taggar experienced a relatively smooth capital-raising process for Phosphor Capital. His established relationships with previous investors, including those from Zeus Living, proved invaluable. “I had a relationship with them and a track record, so they knew me, and they knew how hard I work,” he explained. Beyond existing relationships, Phosphor’s limited partners (LPs) also include family offices and a large asset manager, who are betting on Taggar primarily due to his deep and long-standing ties to Y Combinator. YC partner Jared Friedman aptly described Taggar as an “OG alum from the early days of YC,” highlighting his close connections within the organization. This insider status provides Phosphor Capital with unparalleled access and insights into the YC ecosystem. Taggar’s background as a founder, complete with the challenges and triumphs of building a company like Zeus Living (which, at its peak, was valued over $200 million with an annual revenue run rate of about $120 million before facing headwinds and being sold), resonates deeply with the founders he now supports. Friedman noted, “Zeus was a really hard company to run. He has a tremendous number of battle scars from doing this hard thing in the physical world.” This firsthand experience fosters incredible empathy. “I hear this from founders that he has incredible empathy for what they are going through, because he went through it all himself,” Friedman added. This founder-centric approach makes Phosphor Capital a highly attractive partner for YC startups navigating their own growth journeys. Conclusion: A Focused Bet on the Future of Innovation Kulveer Taggar’s Phosphor Capital represents a compelling new chapter in the world of venture investment, particularly for the Y Combinator ecosystem. By leveraging deep insider knowledge, a proven track record, and the strategic backing of figures like Garry Tan, Phosphor is uniquely positioned to identify and nurture the next generation of successful startups, with a keen eye on transformative areas like artificial intelligence. This focused approach not only promises significant returns for investors but also provides invaluable support and empathy for founders building the future.

2025-07-04T10:07:33,"Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions, Recent Binance Changes, and More: Bits Recap July 4th","TL;DR Analysts remain bullish on XRP, with some eyeing a move to $2.65 or even $3, while others dream of a historic surge to $30. Binance added NEWT and SAHARA to its VIP Loan program, removed several trading pairs (impacting FIO the most), and launched new staking options for SOL-related tokens. After closing Q2 at a record $107,500, BTC hovers near $109K; while some foresee a rally toward $120K, Arthur Hayes warns of a short-term drop to $90K due to US liquidity shifts – though he stays bullish long term. XRP Forecasts Despite its daily decline of around 2.5%, the XRP price is up 6% on a weekly scale and remains the subject of bullish predictions. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Just a few days ago, the X user World of Charts argued that an XRP breakout and retest has already been confirmed , anticipating a pump above $3 sometime in July. For their part, Maxi thinks the token could mirror its impressive performance from the end of 2017 and experience a 1,200% rise in a matter of days. A jump of that type would push the price to a new historic peak of around $30, which, as of the moment, seems quite unlikely. Other popular analysts who made more realistic forecasts include Ali Martinez and Crypto Beast. The former claimed XRP could be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, “potentially setting the stage for a 15% breakout to $2.65.” Crypto Beast expects the price to make a 3x during the ongoing bull run. What’s New Around Binance? The world’s largest crypto exchange recently added Newton Protocol (NEWT) and Sahara AI (SAHARA) as new loanable assets on its VIP Loan program. Despite the support, the tokens witnessed substantial price corrections. Additionally, Binance scrapped the following spot trading pairs: ACT/EUR, FIO/BTC, TNSR/FDUSD, and TST/FDUS. Such actions usually have a negative effect on the involved coins due to reduced liquidity, less visibility, and reputational blow . FIO took the biggest blow, plunging by 8% after the announcement. Earlier today (July 4), Binance came up with another disclosure. It informed its users that they can stake their SOL, HODL BNSOL, sBNSOL, or bzSOL holdings and earn up to 6.5% APR, with boosted LAYER, ACE, and DYM airdrops distributed automatically. “But that’s not all , something new is launching soon,” the exchange teased. How’s BTC Doing? Last but not least, we will delve into the leading cryptocurrency and explore some interesting price forecasts. Bitcoin (BTC) made history in May, reaching a new all-time high of almost $112,000. In the weeks that followed, it saw a slight pullback but still closed Q2 at around $107,500 – the highest quarterly finish in its history. The crypto community remains quite bullish that the asset, currently trading just south of $109,000, could be on the verge of a rally toward a fresh peak. X user CRYPTOWZRD thinks a breakout above $110,500 could push the price to $120,000. On the other hand, Arthur Hayes (co-founder of BitMEX) predicted a short-term pullback to $90,000 due to a potential liquidity drain from the US Treasury issuing new debt following Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill. “ However, he remains a bull for the long term, viewing the possible pullback as just a temporary event.

2025-07-04T10:00:00,"Meta AI Unleashes Proactive Chatbots: A Groundbreaking Shift in User Engagement","BitcoinWorld Meta AI Unleashes Proactive Chatbots: A Groundbreaking Shift in User Engagement In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where blockchain innovations often grab headlines, another significant transformation is quietly underway: the rise of advanced artificial intelligence. Meta, a titan in the tech world, is once again pushing boundaries, introducing Meta AI chatbots designed to proactively engage users across its vast ecosystem. This move signals a profound shift in how we interact with technology, raising questions not just about convenience, but also privacy and the future of digital relationships. What Are Meta’s Proactive AI Chatbots? Imagine receiving an unsolicited message from an AI chatbot while using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. This is no longer a futuristic concept but a real development from Meta. For instance, a sample AI persona named “The Maestro of Movie Magic” might send a message like, “I hope you’re having a harmonious day! I wanted to check in and see if you’ve discovered any new favorite soundtracks or composers recently. Or perhaps you’d like some recommendations for your next movie night? Let me know, and I’ll be happy to help!” This is an example of what proactive messaging from AI chatbots could look like on Meta’s platforms. Leaked documents viewed by Business Insider revealed that Meta is working with data labeling firm Alignerr to train these customizable chatbots. These bots are designed to reach out to users unprompted and follow up on past conversations, remembering details about users. Users can create these bots within Meta’s AI Studio platform. Meta has confirmed that it is testing follow-up messaging with its AIs, with specific parameters: Chatbots will only send follow-ups within 14 days after a user initiates a conversation. The user must have sent at least five messages to the bot within that timeframe. If there is no response to the first follow-up, the chatbots will not continue messaging. Users will have the option to keep their bots private or share them through various channels, including stories, direct links, and even displaying them on their Facebook or Instagram profiles. A Meta spokesperson stated, “This allows you to continue exploring areas of interest and engage in more meaningful conversations with the AIs across our apps.” The Evolution of AI Companions and User Engagement The technology underpinning Meta’s proactive chatbots shares similarities with offerings from established AI startups like Character.AI and Replika. Both companies enable their chatbots to initiate conversations and ask questions, aiming to function as AI companions . Notably, Character.AI’s new CEO, Karandeep Anand, joined the company last month after serving as Meta’s VP of business products, highlighting the talent flow within the AI space. While Meta emphasizes the goal of fostering “meaningful conversations” and aiding Mark Zuckerberg’s quest to combat the “loneliness epidemic,” the company’s core business model remains rooted in advertising revenue. Meta has a history of leveraging algorithms to maximize user engagement , driving more eyes to advertisements through continuous scrolling, commenting, and liking. The introduction of proactive chatbots aligns with this strategy, creating new avenues for interaction and, potentially, future monetization. The Promise and Peril of Generative AI The financial implications of Meta’s ventures into generative AI are substantial. Unsealed court documents from April indicate Meta’s projection of securing $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue from its generative AI products by 2025, with an ambitious target of up to $1.4 trillion by 2035. A significant portion of this revenue is expected to come from Meta’s revenue-sharing agreements with companies hosting its open Llama collection of models. The company has also hinted that its AI assistant may eventually feature ads and offer a subscription option. However, increased engagement comes with inherent risks. Character.AI, a comparable platform, is currently facing an active lawsuit following allegations that one of its bots played a role in the death of a 14-year-old boy. When questioned about its safety protocols to prevent such incidents, Meta directed inquiries to a series of disclaimers: An AI’s response “may be inaccurate or inappropriate and should not be used to make important decisions.” AIs are not licensed professionals or experts trained to help people. “Chats with custom AIs can’t replace professional advice. You shouldn’t rely on AI chats for medical, psychological, financial, legal, or any other type of professional advice.” Regarding age limitations, Bitcoin World found no company-imposed age restrictions for using Meta AI, although laws in Tennessee and Puerto Rico do limit teen engagement with some AI services. Meta’s foray into proactive AI chatbots represents a significant leap in digital interaction, promising enhanced user engagement and personalized experiences. While the vision of helpful AI companions and substantial revenue from generative AI is compelling, the inherent risks—from data privacy to the potential for misuse and psychological impact—demand careful consideration. As these advanced Meta AI systems become more integrated into our daily lives, a critical balance must be struck between innovation and user safety, ensuring that the pursuit of engagement doesn’t compromise well-being.

The company said it processed 709 assistance requests, including 124 official freeze orders from law enforcement — many tied to transnational cybercrime investigations. In total, 41 cases led to successfully intercepted assets. MEXC also launched a $100 million Guardian Fund aimed at covering losses from protocol-level breaches. This move aligns with a broader trend among top exchanges offering user protection mechanisms, following high-profile incidents such as the $70 million hack of a DeFi aggregator in May. The report also highlights expanded risk monitoring infrastructure, with 46,311 suspicious accounts restricted and 6,184 fraud rings identified in the CIS, India, and Southeast Asia — regions seeing sharp rises in coordinated wallet fraud and account takeovers. Meanwhile, MEXC continues to update its Proof of Reserves (PoR) data, listing real-time wallet balances that exceed all user deposits. As of June 26, reserves included 4,083 BTC, 69,234 ETH, and 2.32 billion USDT. The release comes as the European Union finalizes MiCA implementation standards, and as multiple Asian regulators push for “verified solvency” policies for crypto exchanges.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events.

Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 WLD Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) is poised for potential price action as it aims to retest the $1.60 level. If optimistic momentum builds, a further bullish movement could lead to $2.12 level. However, if WLD fails to maintain its bullish trajectory, it risks dropping back to as low as $0.57. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) Worldcoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.57 1.60 2.12 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 In the first half of 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) continued its downward trend, particularly in Q1, where it hit an all-time low of $0.57. However, a glimmer of hope emerged in Q2 as the price attempted to rise from April onwards. Unfortunately, momentum faltered after reaching $1.62, and from the third week of May to the third week of June, the price fell to $0.79. Yet, the last week of June brought a positive shift, with improved geopolitical conditions helping the price surge to the $0.90 mark. This movement from April and June lows suggests a potential reawakening of bullish sentiment, as a slight upward trendline has taken support, hinting at a possible short-term rise. At this juncture, many are curious: what could propel Worldcoin higher? History shows that social sentiment often plays a crucial role in the crypto space. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s value. If optimistic momentum builds in the coming sessions, WLD might retest the $1.60 level in July. A further bullish movement could lead to a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure, breaking above the $2.12 level. Clearing this threshold and confirming a ChoCh could signal a breakout from its bearish pattern, potentially allowing Worldcoin to retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, caution is warranted. If WLD fails to maintain its bullish trajectory this year, it could drop as low as $0.57, reminding investors of the volatility inherent in the crypto market.

2025-07-04T09:45:35,"Nano Labs Begins BNB Accumulation with $50M Purchase","Chinese microchip manufacturer Nano Labs has officially started its ambitious plan to build a major treasury of BNB , the native token of Binance. On Thursday, the company confirmed it had acquired $50 million worth of BNB, marking the first step toward its goal of holding between 5% and 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply. Nano Labs reiterated its long-term target of spending up to $1 billion on BNB, with its latest purchase bringing its combined crypto holdings, including Bitcoin, to approximately $160 million. Founded in 2019 by Kong Jianping and Sun Qifeng following their tenure at hardware giant Canaan, Nano Labs went public in 2022 and specializes in high-performance computing chips and high-throughput computing solutions. While the company’s initial announcement to issue $500 million in convertible notes for its BNB treasury previously sent its stock soaring by over 106%, the latest purchase failed to generate similar enthusiasm. Nano Labs Aiming for 10% BNB Supply With BNB’s circulating supply at 145.8 million and a market capitalization of $93.4 billion, acquiring 10% at market rates would require around $926 million in additional purchases from Nano Labs. Binance’s ongoing token burns have steadily reduced BNB’s circulating supply, with Binance and its former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao reportedly holding a combined 71% of the circulating supply, according to a June 2024 Forbes report. A BNB Chain spokesperson acknowledged the increased institutional interest in BNB, stating, “We welcome all organic adoption that supports BNB and the sustainable growth of our ecosystem.” Crypto Treasuries Face Investor Scrutiny Despite a broader trend of companies adding crypto to their treasuries , some industry figures remain skeptical about the long-term appeal. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, told Bloomberg that while he remains bullish on Bitcoin, investors may question whether it makes sense to back a company holding crypto instead of purchasing the asset directly. “The question is, if you’re giving somebody $10 and they’re putting $8 into Bitcoin, are they going to do well? Yes. But you might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin,” Scaramucci said, emphasizing that investors must carefully evaluate the underlying costs tied to crypto treasury strategies.

2025-07-04T09:43:02,"Bitcoin is deep into its bull run, here’s what comes next: analyst","Bitcoin may be entering the final phase of its current bull cycle, with a potential market peak just months away, according to market analyst Rekt Capital. In a recent breakdown , the Bitcoin ( BTC ) analyst compared the current market structure to past halving cycles, using historical timeframes to estimate where Bitcoin stands. His analysis is based on a model where Bitcoin typically peaks between 518 and 550 days after halving, a pattern seen in both the 2016 and 2020 cycles. According to Rekt Capital, the market is roughly 88% through the typical post-halving period, now entering the later stages of the cycle. If the same trend holds, the next cycle top could fall within late September and mid-October 2025. #BTC Bull Market Progress: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 88.0% (Progress will speed up on Parabolic advances) $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/GPwGPR7Cz5 — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) July 1, 2025 While some market participants may expect the current cycle to stretch into 2026, Rekt Capital cautioned against extending expectations too far beyond historical patterns, saying that doing so could lead investors to miss the window of opportunity. One of the defining features of this cycle, according to Rekt Capital, is the longest post-halving reaccumulation period in Bitcoin’s history. For eight months after the April 2024 halving, BTC remained in a period of consolidation. You might also like: Bitcoin breaks through $107,000, is the stagnant period over? According to the analyst, this was necessary to offset the strong pre-halving upside that pushed the asset’s price significantly ahead of schedule and realign the cycle with historical trends. What comes next? With the crypto king still consolidating just below its all-time high, Rekt Capital explained that similar phases of slowing momentum or “price discovery corrections” occurred at this stage in both the 2017 and 2021 cycles. These periods often gave way to renewed momentum leading into the final phase of the bull market. However, he emphasized that as the cycle matures, the risk-to-reward ratio begins to shift. While some upside may remain, the scale of potential gains becomes smaller compared to the downside risk of a full-cycle correction. Rekt Capital cited historical drawdowns of 60–70% that followed prior bull market tops, underscoring the importance of managing risk and preparing for volatility. Rekt Capital also addressed the idea of cycle extensions, noting that while the current cycle could stretch slightly, as past ones have by around 30 days, using those assumptions to delay profit-taking carries risk. “The danger here is if we’re going to keep moving the goalpost, at some point we’re going to miss that bull market top,” he said. With that in mind, the analyst suggested sticking to past patterns, and that anything beyond the historical window should be treated as “bonus time” rather than a guarantee of further upside. The focus for investors, he said, should now shift toward preparing for that window, protecting gains, and not getting distracted by newer cycle narratives that lack historical backing. BTC has been in a steady climb over the past week, trading slightly over $108,840 at press time.

The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise.

July 2025 Price Action for HBAR As of the first week of July 2025, HBAR is trading near its upper boundary, following a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June. The price is inching closer to the $0.191 resistance level. If bullish momentum continues and HBAR achieves a daily close above this mark, it could potentially retest the resistance levels at $0.23 and $0.27 in July or the coming months. However, on the downside, failure to maintain multi-month support and rejection from the 200-day EMA could lead the price to drop toward $0.072. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High HBAR Price Prediction July 2025 $0.072 $0.191 $0.270 Hedera Price Projection 2025 Hedera experienced a volatile H1 2025. After peaking at $0.40 in mid-January, the HBAR price began a steady decline. External factors and waning investor engagement, evident in the Total Value Locked (TVL), pushed it into a converging falling wedge pattern, ultimately hitting a low of $0.125 in early April. However, the tide began to turn in the second week of April. A broader crypto rally provided a much-needed lift for HBAR. It broke free from the wedge, bouncing off a robust support zone that had previously fueled a rally in Q4 2024. This zone, validated by the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) indicator, indicated strong buying interest and set the stage for a sharp rebound. In a remarkable surge, HBAR climbed nearly 80%, rising from $0.125 to $0.228 between April and mid-May. Unfortunately, this momentum was short-lived. As geopolitical tensions escalated in mid-May, HBAR’s price retreated back to its April lows, forming a parallel declining wedge. As of the first week of July, HBAR is trading near its upper boundary. This movement follows a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June, inching closer to the $0.191 resistance level. If the bulls regain strength and achieve a daily close above this mark, HBAR could potentially retest the $0.23 and $0.27 resistance levels in July or the coming months. Looking ahead, a daily close above $0.27 in Q3 or Q4 could pave the way for a return to $0.40. If the momentum persists, HBAR might even reach $0.75 by year-end. On the downside, failing to maintain multi-month support and facing rejection from the 200-day EMA could see the price drop toward $0.072. Despite the muted price movement, Hedera’s internal developments tell a more promising story. The ecosystem continues to expand. In 2025, Hedera launched its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , along with an AI-based tool called the Hedera Agent Kit , which simplifies token creation. Another significant project, HashSphere, is set to launch in Q3 2025. This initiative aims to provide a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. Additionally, Hedera underwent a rebranding on May 15, with the HBAR Foundation now known as the “Hedera Foundation” and the Governing Council rebranded as the “Hedera Council.” This restructuring positions Hedera for a stronger future, signaling maturity within its ecosystem. In summary, while external pressures weigh on HBAR’s price, the internal progress of Hedera remains robust. If macro conditions improve, 2025 could still witness a significant turnaround for the platform.

Key Takeaways: Binance Institutional Loans let corporate clients borrow with up to 4x leverage. Borrowed funds are instantly deployed to dedicated margin accounts. Binance supports over 400 collateral assets and offers 0% interest opportunities. The product aims to boost capital efficiency for high-frequency and institutional traders who need rapid access to liquidity, the exchange said on Thursday . Unlike standard margin products tied to a single account, Institutional Loans let traders pool collateral from up to ten Spot, Cross Margin, and Portfolio Margin sub-accounts. Binance Loans Enable Instant Margin Access via Dedicated Accounts Borrowed funds are credited to a dedicated Portfolio Margin, Portfolio Margin Pro, or Cross Margin account, enabling instant deployment across Binance’s Margin and Futures markets. Borrowers can access loans between 1 to 10 million USDC or USDT, secured against net equity across their collateralized accounts. Binance’s program supports over 400 collateral assets, with major Spot tokens like BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, SOL, and BNB exempt from haircut ratios, giving clients greater borrowing power. An interest rebate program is also available, offering a path to 0% financing if performance criteria are met. To qualify, firms must complete corporate verification and meet VIP 5 trading volume thresholds or undergo a manual assessment. Once approved, they can pledge collateral, monitor loan-to-value ratios, and immediately deploy borrowed assets with spot-like latency. Introducing #Binance Institutional Loans.

As reported, Binance continues to demonstrate its appeal to large market participants through Bitcoin inflows. On May 22, when Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $112,000, the average Bitcoin deposit to Binance spiked to 7 BTC, the highest among all exchanges. For comparison, Bitfinex saw an average of 5 BTC, while OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase recorded lower figures — 1.23, 0.7, and 0.8 BTC, respectively. These numbers suggest Binance is the preferred venue for whales and high-volume traders. Binance Unveils AI-Powered Customizable Interface Last month, Binance launched “Binance UI Refined,” a new app interface offering AI-powered customization that lets its 275 million users tailor their trading homepages with drag-and-drop widgets suited to their experience level and regional preferences. The redesign, announced ahead of Binance’s eighth anniversary, aims to break away from a one-size-fits-all approach. New features include AI widgets like the Trending Widget, which scans posts from X and Binance Square to highlight coins gaining social media traction, alongside real-time sentiment analysis. Other widgets let users monitor spot and futures assets, track ETF flows, follow lead traders, and access yield products. Meanwhile, Binance is also expanding into newly reopened markets.

She directly addressed the frequent question of why she joined the company and responded by saying, “I joined the board of Ripple because XRP serves a purpose.” She clarified that XRP facilitates cross-border payments and differentiated it from digital assets that serve as arbitrary stores of value. She stated that XRP “is not some store of value kind of arbitrary value that is not pegged to anything.” Rios explained that XRP has a clear and defined utility within the financial sector, particularly in the area of international payments. “This is actually what legitimate financial institutions use specifically for cross-border payments,” she said. Rios described the innovation as transforming transactions from being measured in “days and dollars” to “seconds and cents,” which she described as the direction the financial world is moving toward. Blockchain, Government, and Institutional Lag During her remarks, Rios emphasized that blockchain and Bitcoin are here to stay. She noted that innovation often outpaces regulatory and governmental frameworks, attributing this lag to a lack of subject-matter experts within government institutions. “The unfortunate part about government traditionally is it doesn’t lead, it follows,” she said. She acknowledged the efforts of the current U.S. administration to address this gap by forming task forces and bringing expertise from the private sector into public discussions. Rios highlighted the missed opportunities of the last decade but suggested that momentum is now building, with increased regulatory clarity emerging. She suggested that, for the first time, there is a genuine convergence between regulatory interest and technological innovation.

She indicated that XRP is being utilized by serious financial players and institutions, stating it serves a “function that facilitates cross-border payments.” Her comments underscored that XRP has a clear use case grounded in improving legacy financial processes, offering a faster and more cost-effective solution. She also alluded to the regulatory green light that may happen soon, emphasizing that the landscape is shifting. “You know what four months make in terms of giving that green light for innovation to actually happen?” she asked rhetorically, suggesting that significant regulatory or institutional developments are imminent. The tweet by XRP Governor highlighted Rosie Rios’s public reaffirmation of her position on Ripple and XRP. Her perspective on the broader evolution of blockchain integration into global finance. Rios, leveraging her former role as U.S. Treasurer, framed XRP as an essential and functional component of financial modernization, not merely a digital asset among many.

Among the primary agenda for the week are the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC bill, and the US Senate’s GENIUS Act .A Full Week Dedicated to Driving Crypto InnovationAfter the US House of Representatives passed Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” on Thursday, their attention has now turned to crypto bills. Through a coordinated effort by the US House GOP, the lawmakers have dedicated a whole week to deliberating on and passing legislation specific to the digital assets industry. Crypto Week Agenda Notably, in hindsight, not many would have foreseen this week coming. Barely a year ago, the United States repelled cryptocurrencies under the Joe Biden administration, with former US SEC Chair Gary Gensler in power.Meanwhile, Trump is keeping to his promises of making America the crypto capital of the world. He recently called Bitcoin “amazing” and claimed he had built the crypto industry. Now, the latest US House announcement reflects that the crypto innovation push is now a national interest.US House to Approve Multiple Crypto Bills in July?The US House aims to pass the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed in the US Senate. The bill aims to establish clear guidelines for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, projected to attract trillions of dollars into the US economy. Notably, Trump has passionately called on the House to expedite the bill's delivery to him for final approval.Furthermore, the House would also attempt to pass the CLARITY Act and quickly move it to the Senate. Remarkably, the bill has already passed a vote from both the Agriculture and Financial Services Committees and now requires full House support to pass.Finally, the US House would deliberate on the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, a bill that aims to prohibit the Central Bank from establishing a digital currency. The House Financial Services Committee approved the legislation with a slim 27-22 vote in April, keeping the proposal alive.Meanwhile, several remarks followed the announcement, with several members of the House of Representatives expressing their optimism ahead of “Crypto Week.” Chairman Hill called the move a “historic step” to ensure that the United States remains the world’s leader in the crypto landscape. “We are advancing landmark legislation to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets that safeguards customers and investors,” he added.Additionally, Senator Cynthia Lummis lauded the effort of Congress to capitalize on Trump’s friendly stance on digital assets. “For the first time in US history, we have a president who sees the value in embracing digital assets,” she stated.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/04/the-us-house-designates-july-14-18-as-crypto-week/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-us-house-designates-july-14-18-as-crypto-week,"REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT","Market",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T09:30:00,"Best Altcoin to Invest in Now: These 2 Coins Will Have Bigger Gains Than Bitcoin (BTC) by the End of Q3","As Bitcoin (BTC) maintains a tight trading range at $106,900, investors are increasingly shifting their attention toward altcoins with more aggressive growth potential heading into Q3. While Solana (SOL) continues to chart a steady course in the $151 after recent volatility, it’s a new cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , that’s generating the loudest buzz across crypto forums and trading channels. Currently priced at $0.03 MUTM is moving fast through its presale phase. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 60% is already sold out because of huge demand. The project is priced at $0.03. Over $11.7 million has been raised to date and over 12,700 investors have joined. Unlike Bitcoin, whose upward potential may be tapering after its ETF-fueled highs earlier this year, these two altcoins, particularly Mutuum Finance are showing stronger upside potential through Q3 based on both sentiment and volume data. Solana Seizes Market Spotlight as BTC Trades Flat As Bitcoin lingers in the $106,000 zone, Solana (SOL) is turning heads with renewed bullish momentum, currently trading around $151.44. Recent optimism has been fueled by anticipation of the first Solana Staking ETF from Rex Shares and Osprey, which launched this week and gave SOL a roughly 5% jump to the $157–$158 range. On-chain data shows strong activity, with daily transactions at record highs and a breakout above the 200-day EMA signaling technical strength. Short-term forecasts now point toward potential upside to $165–$175 by Q3 if SOL holds support above $150. That said, it still risks dropping toward $136–$140 if bearish pressure returns. With its staking ETF debut and growing ecosystem utility, SOL is standing out among altcoins, even as some investors shift attention toward high-upside presale projects like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Reaches $11.7 Million in Funding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well on its path to being one of the hottest projects in DeFi. With an astonishing $11.7 million raised and over 12,700 investors already joining, the presale is gaining serious traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next round will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already determined official launch price of $0.06, early investors already enjoy a 100% profit before the token is even available for sale. Some even foresee a post-launch price bounce of more than $2.50 before the bull run of 2025 is finished. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users climb the ranks they will be rewarded in bonus tokens token holding fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. Mutuum Finance Announces $50,000 Bug Bounty In order to strengthen security, Mutuum Finance has already introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program together with CertiK, rewards such that every vulnerability will be rewarded in the four stages, the first level will be critical, second-level will be the major, third level will be minor, and fourth level will be low. Bitcoin may be slowing, but Solana and Mutuum Finance are gearing up for major moves. With SOL riding ETF momentum and Mutuum Finance’s presale flying past $11.7 million, these two altcoins are proving to be top contenders for outsized returns by the end of Q3. MUTM’s 100% guaranteed ROI at launch, rising token demand, and powerful DeFi model make it especially hard to ignore. If you’re looking to get ahead of the next wave of crypto growth, this may be your last chance to buy MUTM at $0.03 before the next price jump.

Origins of the wallets trace back to 2011 According to onchain data, the wallets can be traced back to a transaction on April 3, 2011, when Bitcoin address “1HqXB…gDwcK” transferred a total of 23,377.83 BTC to three different destinations. Two of those addresses—“12tLs…xj2me” and “1KbrS…AWJYm”—each received 10,000 BTC, while the remaining 3,377.83 BTC was sent to a third address, which later moved or spent the funds within the same year. Since that 2011 transfer, both 10,000 BTC wallets had remained untouched until this week. The addresses had no prior outgoing transactions until they were both activated within 30 minutes of each other, sending their entire holdings to new, unidentified addresses. The recipient wallets have not moved the funds since receiving them. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $108,800.78, down 0.61% in the last 24 hours. The trading volumes were also slightly down to $48.05 billion. Massive value appreciation Over the 14-year period of inactivity, the value of the 20,000 BTC increased dramatically, surging from $7,800 in 2011 to $2.18 billion as of early Friday morning—a staggering 13,982,800% appreciation. The original transfer took place when Bitcoin was trading at around $0.39 per coin. Despite the scale of the movement, the identity of the wallet owners remains unknown. It is also unclear whether the two addresses were controlled by the same entity or by different individuals. Bitcoin Pepe combines Bitcoin and Solana Bitcoin Pepe is carving out a distinct space within the cryptocurrency sector by combining the viral appeal of meme culture with a development focus anchored in Bitcoin infrastructure. Functioning as a Layer 2 solution, the project builds on Bitcoin’s security framework while aiming to offer scalability comparable to networks such as Solana. This combination sets Bitcoin Pepe apart from other meme-themed crypto assets. As a meme-centric Layer 2 network built on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe is broadening its reach through a series of strategic partnerships. These alliances span various sectors, including gaming, content creation, decentralised finance (DeFi), and fair launch infrastructure, to build an ecosystem where the BPEP token delivers both cultural relevance and cross-chain functionality. These efforts are expected to support wider adoption and enhance the project’s visibility. Interest from institutional participants and the broader crypto community is growing, particularly around the emerging PEP-20 token standard. Investor engagement is evident in the project’s ongoing presale, which has raised over $16.295 million to date. The token is currently available at $0.0437, and the price is set to jump to $0.0458. Further momentum is being driven by confirmed exchange listings on MEXC and BitMart, with the final listing announcement scheduled for July 31.

2025-07-04T09:23:27,"How may the heavy demand for Bitcoin impact the Bitcoin lending market?","On July 1, 2025, major lending platform Ledn stopped supporting Ether and turned into a 100% Bitcoin-focused company. While the move aligns well with the wave of Bitcoin-mania, the same focus on Bitcoin from corporations, institutions, and governments poses new threats for the Bitcoin lending business. Full focus on Bitcoin Ledn had plans to drop support for other cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin. While Bitcoin maximalists may see it as a manifestation of Bitcoin purism, the company explained the move differently: it aims to make its product simpler and focus on excelling in the only operation type–Bitcoin lending. Regardless of the reasoning, the move is well-received among those who don’t give credit to any cryptocurrency except for Bitcoin. This audience is getting increasingly visible in this cycle. now I can start recommending Ledn again. — Brad Mills 🔑⚡️ (@bradmillscan) July 2, 2025 Ledn co-founder Adam Reeds called this transition the return to the roots. Earlier, Ledn named risk management as the reason for a future halt on using clients’ assets for yield farming. The assets are kept by Ledn itself or via the company’s partners. Bitcoin-backed loans and the current market situation In the past, the Bitcoin lending sector saw turbulence. In 2022, Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, and Genius were shut down. Ledn looks in the future optimistically as the Trump Administration’s efforts to make the crypto business less restrictive are good for Bitcoin-backed loans ventures. One of the main moves benefiting Bitcoin lending was the repeal of the SAB 121, a controversial 2022 rule that made crypto custody really hard. Read more: SEC repeals SAB 121, easing crypto custody rules Another trend that can serve as a tailwind for Bitcoin lending is the accumulation of Bitcoin by Bitcoin treasury companies, although their activity can have a negative impact too (we’ll speak about it too). Companies like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Nakamoto, Metaplanet, and others are buying Bitcoin in bulk. Governments accumulate Bitcoin they got through seizing, mining, and other means. Institutional custodians like BlackRock or Fidelity rapidly grow their Bitcoin accounts, too. All of these lock huge amounts of bitcoins out of the market, which leads to stabilizing the lower edge of the Bitcoin price, which is the perfect climate for Bitcoin lending companies. The increase in the number of Bitcoin allies among institutional investors is also vital for companies like Ledn, as lending ventures need more dollars in the sector to let more operations for more people. Even in February 2025, Reeds was stating that the lending sector is “incredibly short dollars” and needs more institutional investors to allow more people to take Bitcoin-backed mortgages, etc. Bitcoin derivatives markets (that cannot exist without Bitcoin lending) cement the BTC price stability, too. Ledn co-founder Mauricio Di Bartolomeo outlined it in his essay on responsible yield on digital assets. He writes that Bitcoin lending crushes down price volatility, makes spreads tighter, and improves the health of the spot short markets that are used as a hedge. Therefore, the market needs Bitcoin lending, and it’s another reason for companies like Ledn to come up. New threats for Bitcoin lending Everyone’s focus on Bitcoin may play a mean role for the lending sector. In the current cycle, individuals and institutions are reluctant to sell their bitcoins. Instead, everybody seems to try to accumulate as much as possible, and Bitcoin treasury companies, huge asset management companies, and governments lock up more Bitcoin than miners produce, effectively devouring liquidity. At some point, lending companies may face a situation of a Bitcoin deficit available for lending out. This, in turn, may lead to an increase in borrow rates on spot short markets, a shrinkage in short interest (it may get barely profitable), and less value clarity in the market as bearish sentiment won’t be reflected adequately on the derivatives market. This means that the price will behave less predictably, and the volatility will increase. Shorting on futures markets becomes unprofitable and riskier, too. As the Bitcoin price goes up, Bitcoin bears may lose billions in liquidations. $6,000,000,000 worth of #Bitcoin shorts to be liquidated at $120,000 👀 LET’S LIQUIDATE THEM ALL 🚀 pic.twitter.com/6lzCOud4FV — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) July 3, 2025 As the short market is shrinking and borrowing Bitcoin becomes too expensive, the options market liquidity will drop. Arbitrage trading will become less flexible, which may lead to distortion in the futures market prices as they may face higher discrepancies from the spot market. On the individual side, these problems open up more exposure to counterparty risk, trust-reliance, and the need for leverage. Ironically, all of these risks are what Bitcoin was intended to fight in the first place. Conclusion The crypto market and the broader financial market have complex structures, and every action contributes to various impacts, both positive and negative ones. Heavy demand for Bitcoin by institutions, corporations, and governments may make it hard to borrow Bitcoin. It, in turn, may negatively impact the derivatives markets and lead to price volatility and liquidations on spot short markets. This may make things worse for the actor, depending on Bitcoin reserves; that’s how this circle closes. However, as the Bitcoin price stabilizes and the regulation may get friendlier, there is hope for a positive scenario.

2025-07-04T09:20:27,"Best crypto presales to buy as the US House sets mid-July as ‘Crypto Week’","Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) are showing renewed strength heading into the weekend, with price action suggesting further upside could be on the horizon. Bitcoin broke above the upper boundary of its recent consolidation range at $108,355 on Wednesday and extended its rally by 3.64% through Thursday. As of Friday, it hovers near the $109,000 mark. If bullish momentum continues, BTC could make another attempt at its all-time high of $111,980 set on May 22. The cryptocurrency has remained above the $100,000 level since June 22, when it briefly dipped to $98,900 during heightened geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. The continued strength is also seen in the early-stage project Bitcoin Pepe . US House sets mid-July as ‘Crypto Week’ Following the passage of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill , House Republicans have slated the week of July 14 as “Crypto Week,” during which lawmakers will consider a trio of major digital asset proposals. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill (R-Ark.), and Agriculture Committee Chair GT Thompson confirmed on Thursday that the House will take up legislation addressing stablecoins, broader crypto market structure, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Financial Services GOP @FinancialCmte · Follow 🚨NEW: Chairman @RepFrenchHill , @HouseAgGOP Chairman @CongressmanGT , and House Leadership announced that the week of July 14th will be “Crypto Week,” where the CLARITY Act, Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and GENIUS Act will be considered. @SpeakerJohnson @SteveScalise 2:09 am · 4 Jul 2025 1.3K Reply Copy link Read 82 replies “House Republicans are taking decisive steps to deliver the full scope of President Trump’s digital assets and cryptocurrency agenda,” Johnson said in a statement . While there had been speculation that the House would introduce its own stablecoin bill—informally dubbed the STABLE Act—lawmakers now appear focused on advancing the Senate-approved GENIUS Act. President Trump has called for stablecoin legislation to reach his desk by August, and aligning with the Senate version could accelerate that timeline. Bitcoin Pepe stands to gain from regulatory clarity Improving regulatory clarity in the US is expected to bring greater transparency to altcoins and meme coins, potentially reshaping investor perceptions across the digital asset ecosystem. As oversight strengthens, the market may gradually pivot from speculative trading toward utility-driven narratives, creating room for technically ambitious projects that combine cultural relevance with real-world functionality. Among these is Bitcoin Pepe, a project positioned as the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network. It aims to merge Bitcoin’s base-layer security with Solana-like scalability, offering a more durable use case compared to typical meme tokens that rely solely on social momentum. Launched in February, the Bitcoin Pepe presale has continued to attract high-risk, high-reward capital and has so far raised over $16.2 million. The BPEP token is currently priced at $0.0437, with a price increase expected once contributions surpass $17.07 million. The token is set to list on BitMart and MEXC, with a final listing announcement slated for July 31. These upcoming milestones continue to drive investor attention as the presale enters its final phase.

2025-07-04T09:15:49,"Billionaire Ray Dalio Says US Unlikely To Change Debt Trajectory and Avoid a Financial Crash – Here’s Why","Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio says the US could be headed to a financial crash because political leaders are cautious against taking aggressive actions to address America’s budget deficit. In a post on the social media platform X, the billionaire says senior members of both the Democratic and Republican parties agree that the US needs to reduce its deficit to 3% of the GDP (g ross domestic product). But he says the so-called absolutist policies prevent the adoption of measures such as tax increases and cuts to benefits that can address the debt problem. “They explained the absolutist policies that must exist and those are that you must make statements like I will absolutely pledge not to raise your taxes or I will absolutely pledge not to reduce your benefits.” Dalio says it is clear that the US is unlikely to change its debt trajectory and could face painful consequences. He says political leaders may be thrown out by their constituents and face pressure from their parties, so they find it impossible to make compromising statements and actions that can balance the revenue and expenses to produce a good budget. “That’s the equivalent of saying I will absolutely pledge not to change the trajectory we’re on in order to have a better set of circumstances than the likely financial crash that we’re going to have.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-04T09:11:06,"Dogecoin to Jump to $0.42, $1.46, and $4 This Cycle: Expert","A top market analyst has suggested that Dogecoin could repeat the success of its past cycle, pushing prices to higher prices. Dogecoin, the largest meme coin by market cap, has yet to find its footing this cycle. With a stellar 5,000% and 20,000% price uptick in the previous two cycles, DOGE has been below par so far, according to its standards.Meanwhile, Dogecoin has declined 13% over the past month and corrected by 14% in June. Despite a mild 4% gain over the past seven days, the meme coin leader has declined by a staggering 46% year-to-date, a clear sign that it is well within bearish territory despite Bitcoin’s success.History Suggests a Rebound Is on CourseNonetheless, Dogecoin enthusiasts have remained optimistic that it can still post a staggering upside this cycle. Fueling this expectation is a recurring pattern on its monthly chart that shows a glimpse of its previous price development.Top analyst Trader Tardigrade highlighted this repeating pattern in a recent X post , asserting that it would significantly impact Dogecoin’s price. Specifically, he projected a rally to finally surpass the one-dollar price mark and reach new highs.Importantly, an accompanying chart highlights this recurring pattern. According to the chart, Dogecoin trended atop an ascending trendline between 2015 and late 2017 before breaking out to price levels not previously seen. Dogecoin to $4/Trader Tardigrade Dogecoin made higher highs and higher lows with the trend, moving from $0.0001 to $0.0003, then broke out to reach $0.0026. Subsequently, DOGE consolidated from the high before a final push to close at $0.009 in December 2017.Pattern Set to Push Dogecoin to $4Trader Tardigrade highlighted that a similar pattern is forming on Dogecoin’s 1M timeframe. Notably, DOGE is currently trending along the ascending trendline after forming two sets of higher highs and higher lows, ranging from $0.059 to as high as $0.4846, before retracing to its current price of $0.167. Notably, all these happened from August 2023 up until now.Meanwhile, the analyst expects the breakout phase to begin soon and highlighted three targets for Dogecoin. First, he predicts a price increment to $0.42, which is 151% away from the current price.Next, he expects a jump to $1.46, marking a new all-time high for Dogecoin. From the current price, this represents a 774% increase.Ultimately, he predicts that Dogecoin would reach an ambitious $4 by the end of this cycle, taking its market cap to approximately $600 billion. This represents a 2,295% uptick from DOGE's present market price.Interestingly, the analyst's chart suggests that Dogecoin could continue its upward trend, similar to its performance in 2021, after completing the current pattern. His chart shows DOGE can reach a ridiculous $240 price per coin.Remarkably, Trader Tardoigrade has a history of predicting ambitious targets for Dogecoin. He projected a rise to $4.5 and above in June and highlighted another recurring historical pattern on the DOGE chart that could propel a rally to $12.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/04/dogecoin-to-jump-to-0-42-1-46-and-4-this-cycle-expert/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dogecoin-to-jump-to-0-42-1-46-and-4-this-cycle-expert,"DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BTC","Market|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T09:09:35,"26,000 New Bitcoin Millionaires in 2025, But Why Is Trump Losing Money?","The post 26,000 New Bitcoin Millionaires in 2025, But Why Is Trump Losing Money? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News More than 26,000 new Bitcoin millionaires were added in the first half of 2025. But while the crypto market pushed many into the millionaire club, President Donald Trump saw his personal crypto portfolio take a massive hit – dropping over 78% in just six months. Yes, we have the same question. How is that possible? Here’s a deep dive. Bitcoin’s Bull Run Creates 26,000+ Millionaires According to data from Finbold, 26,758 Bitcoin wallets crossed the $1 million mark between January and June this year. That brings the total number of Bitcoin millionaires to 182,327 as of June 30. Over 26,000 new Bitcoin millionaires added in first half of 2025 https://t.co/xZ5MUtFukM $BTC — Finbold (@finbold) July 2, 2025 A strong second quarter and Bitcoin’s halving in April played a major role in this spike. The halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, pushing supply pressure and sending Bitcoin prices soaring. On May 22, Bitcoin hit a high of $111,970, creating a wave of fresh wealth for long-term holders and institutional investors who bought during the dips. Trump’s Portfolio Drops While Bitcoin was climbing, President Trump’s crypto portfolio went the other way. He started the year with around $10.16 million in crypto assets. By the end of June, that figure had dropped to just $2.20 million – a loss of over 78%. Ouch. Most of the damage happened in the first quarter, with his holdings falling to $1.96 million by March. A minor recovery added back around $240,000 in Q2. But overall, the decline was sharp. A tweet by John Morgan summed it up: “Donald Trump’s crypto portfolio loses 78% of value in first half of 2025.” The biggest holding in Trump’s wallet was the meme coin TROG, worth over $800,000. Other tokens included MAGA (TRUMP), MATIC, and USDC – all considered riskier bets, especially in a market that’s shifting toward fundamentals. WLFI, Linked to Trump’s Family, Sees 115% Growth In contrast, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi platform backed by Trump’s family, has been on the rise. The platform’s value grew from $72.82 million to $178.15 million in the same six-month period, marking a gain of over 115%. WLFI’s performance was supported by institutional interest and momentum from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approvals earlier this year. Unlike Trump’s personal portfolio, WLFI appears to follow a more structured investment strategy, and it’s paying off. Hmm, interesting. New Crypto Law Could Tighten the Rules On June 23, Senator Adam Schiff introduced the COIN Act, which aims to stop government officials and their families from profiting off crypto investments. The bill would also make it mandatory for them to disclose all digital assets in their financial filings. If passed, this law could directly impact Trump and his family’s involvement in WLFI – adding regulatory pressure to the financial setback. The bill has been co-sponsored by nine Senate Democrats, which means it’s gaining the kind of momentum it needs. Strategy Over Hype The first half of 2025 has made one thing clear: structured crypto strategies are winning, while speculative meme coin plays are getting wiped out. As Bitcoin continues to mature and regulation tightens, investors, even high-profile ones, may need to rethink how they play the game.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/26000-new-bitcoin-millionaires-in-2025-but-why-is-trump-losing-money/,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T09:08:00,"Here’s How High Shiba Inu Price Could Rise If It Becomes Half as Big as Ethereum","If Shiba Inu grows to half the size of Ethereum, its price could soar to a new all-time high, offering significant returns for early investors. Since its launch in August 2020, Shiba Inu has had close ties to the Ethereum blockchain. Specifically, SHIB is an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum, meaning it could benefit directly from any increase in ETH’s value.This relationship is evident in the recent price movements of both assets. IntoTheBlock's data shows that Shiba Inu has maintained a 78% correlation with Ethereum over the past 30 days. This is significantly higher than its 41% correlation with Bitcoin during the same period. Shiba Inu correlation with Ethereum Shiba Inu correlation with EthereumIn the last 24 hours, both Ethereum and Shiba Inu have experienced price declines. ETH has dropped by 1.59%, while SHIB has fallen by 2.01%.Shiba Inu’s Price If It Becomes Half the Size of EthereumGiven Shiba Inu’s connection to Ethereum, The Crypto Basic estimated SHIB’s price if it were to grow to half the size of ETH. This scenario assumes that Shiba Inu’s market capitalization reaches 50% of Ethereum’s current value.As of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,561 with a market cap of $309.27 billion. Half of this valuation equates to approximately $154.64 billion.Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has a market capitalization of $6.9 billion and ranks as the 19th-largest cryptocurrency. SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001172, posting negative returns over the past day.Meanwhile, if Shiba Inu’s market cap were to rise to $154.64 billion, it would represent a 2,141% increase from its current valuation. This would also surpass Jake Gagain’s $100 billion projection for Shiba Inu by 54.64%.At a $154.64 billion market cap, SHIB’s price would reach $0.0002624, setting a new all-time high. At that price, 100 million SHIB tokens bought today for $1,172 would be worth $26,240, representing an ROI of approximately $25,000.Potential Timeline for SHIB to Hit $0.00026Reaching a $154 billion market cap or a unit price of $0.0002624 could be challenging for Shiba Inu due to its massive supply of 589.25 trillion tokens. Many critics argue that burning a significant portion of the supply is necessary for SHIB to reach such high price targets.Nevertheless, some market analysts have disregarded these concerns and continue to forecast SHIB’s climb toward the $0.0002 range.Crypto exchange Changelly predicts SHIB will hit $0.0002624 by April 2032, seven years from now. Meanwhile, the prediction platform Telegaon expects this target to materialize by 2028, two years earlier than Changelly’s estimate.Notably, Telegaon’s forecast aligns with one made by ChatGPT. It also agrees that Shiba Inu could reach the $0.00026 mark by 2028, coinciding with the next Bitcoin halving.Interestingly, a 2024 Forbes article suggested that Shiba Inu would climb to $0.0002624 this year, with a maximum target set at $0.0003. Additionally, analysts have speculated that SHIB could rise to $0.0002649 if it surpasses Tether (USDT) in global crypto rankings.While this analysis presents an optimistic scenario for SHIB, it is intended solely to illustrate the token’s potential if it were to grow to half the size of Ethereum. There is no guarantee that Shiba Inu will achieve this milestone.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/04/heres-how-high-shiba-inu-price-could-rise-if-it-becomes-half-as-big-as-ethereum/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-high-shiba-inu-price-could-rise-if-it-becomes-half-as-big-as-ethereum,"SHIB|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC","Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction",cryptocompare

According to his analysis, the cycle may top out roughly 550 days after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. “That’s already two to three months potentially that we have left in this bull market,” he added. Debate Over Halving Cycle Relevance While Rekt Capital emphasizes the importance of sticking to time-tested halving models, others are more skeptical. He criticized the growing trend of abandoning the halving narrative in favor of newer metrics like Bitcoin’s correlation with global M2 money supply. “Many people are happy to throw away time-tested principles… whereas it’s really important to rely on these sorts of metrics,” he said. He also called the shift an emotional move that clouds sound judgment. Alternative Views Highlight Institutional Impact Some analysts argue that traditional halving cycles are less relevant today due to rising institutional interest. Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick said on Thursday that, “Thanks to increased investor flows, we believe BTC has moved beyond the previous dynamic whereby prices fell 18 months after a ‘halving’ cycle.” In May, Standard Chartered forecast Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by year-end, while Bernstein made a similar prediction. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes remains even more bullish, expecting Bitcoin to hit $250,000. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $109,155, just 2.5% below its all-time high of $111,970. Crypto analyst Crypto Auris also commented recently that, “As global money supply expands, Bitcoin’s next target sits around ~$170K, following the flow.” Analyst Emphasizes Caution Over Hype Despite the bullish sentiment from others, Rekt Capital cautions against ignoring the halving-based cycle. “It’s an emotional thing as well, and you don’t want emotional things clouding your judgement,” he reiterated.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-analyst-warns-bull-market-may-end-by-october/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

Some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency’s imminent rally could target significantly higher levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Key Resistance As Price Reclaims $2,550 – Here Are The Levels To Watch SUI Eyes Key Area Reclaim On Thursday, SUI has surged more than 10% from its $2.70 support toward the crucial $3.00 barrier. The cryptocurrency has been attempting to reclaim this area throughout Thursday, hovering between the $2.95 and $3.08 levels. Notably, the altcoin ended its multi-month downtrend after breaking above its descending resistance at the end of March, fueling its rally toward the $4.29 high in May. Since the Q2 breakout, SUI has been trading within the $2.33-$4.10 range. Nonetheless, the June pullbacks, driven by the global geopolitical tensions, sent the token below the $3.00 mid-range support to its local low of $2.22 nearly two weeks ago, before reclaiming the $2.80-$2.90 area. Amid the start-of-month retracement, the altcoin briefly lost its local range, but the Wednesday pump reignited bullish sentiment and potentially set the stage for a rally continuation. Analyst Alex Clay noted that SUI is currently testing the confluence of the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) resistances alongside its bullish flag resistance. According to the chart, the cryptocurrency has been trading within a bullish flag formation since May, and lost the technical indicators throughout the June pullbacks. Now, the indicators and the patterns’ upper boundary sit as resistance around the $3.00-$3.10 area. If the altcoin reclaims these key levels, the analyst considers that a rally to the $5.00 resistance would be “an easy trade.” Is A Breakout To $10 Nearby? Analyst Marcus pointed out that SUI “just snapped back from the 0.786 Fib zone sharp, clean and confident.” He added that the cryptocurrency’s structure held despite the correction, which confirmed a “healthy pullback, not a breakdown.” To the analyst, the current bounce could be the higher low that sets the stage for SUI’s next major move, as “all signs point to a setup that’s not done yet.” Meanwhile, market Watcher Crypto Yhodda affirmed that SUI is “in a big accumulation right now,” pointing to an eight-month triangle formation. According to the analyst, a breakout from this pattern “can help it reach the dream target of $10.” Similarly, Kaleo highlighted SUI’s bounce on its trading pairs against Bitcoin (BTC) and USD. He explained that there are many similarities between the base the altcoin is currently building and the base from the April lows that propelled the token to its local high. The cryptocurrency bounced off the High timeframe (HTF) ascending support line on both occasions, suggesting a massive rally could be ahead. To the analyst, the $10 target is “a magnet.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Level Amid $108,000 Rejection, But Analysts Suggest Caution This Quarter Crypto Batman also highlighted this ascending support, noting that the recent pullback marks the third time the cryptocurrency has bounced from it since August. Following the previous two retests, the token rallied for weeks toward higher levels, signaling that a breakout could be nearby. Additionally, he considers that SUI displays a “solid-looking setup,” as it is trading above the key $2.30-$2.40 area that has served as resistance and support on the weekly chart. As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.09, a 15% increase in the weekly timeframe.

2025-07-04T09:00:00,"DeFi Development Corp Stock Soars After New Solana Purchase","This latest purchase brought its total SOL holdings to nearly $98 million. The company’s stock surged 17% on Thursday and 30% over two days, thanks to the bullish investor sentiment around its staking plans and a $112.5 million capital raise. Meanwhile, Chinese chipmaker Nano Labs revealed a $50 million BNB acquisition. The company also plans to eventually hold up to 10% of the token’s circulating supply. However, its stock dipped 4.7% despite the move. Additionally design software firm Figma revealed it holds $70 million in Bitcoin ETFs and has reserved an additional $30 million in USDC for future Bitcoin buys. This could mean that the company has a strong conviction in BTC’s long-term value. Together, these developments prove that there is a growing trend of corporate adoption of crypto assets, despite volatility fears, scrutiny from certain industry players, and mixed reactions from investors. DeFi Development Corp Shares Extend Rally DeFi Development Corp. experienced a sharp 17% rally in its stock price on Thursday after announcing a strategic $2.7 million purchase of Solana (SOL) tokens. The company revealed that it bought 17,760 SOL at an average price of $153.10 per token, bringing its total Solana reserves to 640,585 SOL—valued at nearly $98 million. DeFi Development Corp. also clarified that it plans to hold the newly acquired tokens for the long term and will stake them to generate yield. This latest surge in investor interest follows a series of strategic disclosures by the company. On Wednesday, the firm already gained market attention after releasing its June business update, which included plans to raise $112.5 million through private placements. The stock, which trades under the ticker DFDV, rose from a low of $18.47 on Wednesday to $23.80 by the close of trading Thursday. This was a 30% increase over two days. It gained an additional 0.8% in after-hours trading, ending the session at $24, according to Google Finance . While the stock is up over 2,733% year-to-date, it is still down 33% from its all-time high of $35.53 that was reached in May. DeFi Development Corp share price over the past 5 days (Source: Google Finance ) The company has some ambitious plans for the capital raised. Approximately $75.6 million will go toward funding a prepaid forward stock purchase transaction, while the remaining funds are earmarked for general corporate purposes, including additional Solana acquisitions. Although DeFi Development Corp. initially announced in April that it plans to raise $1 billion for Solana-related investments, those plans were temporarily shelved in June after a withdrawal of its SEC filing due to the late submission of a required management report. In a shareholder letter dated July 2, the company addressed the concerns about financial resilience, and explained that its balance sheet is structured to withstand prolonged market drawdowns and ensure long-term NAV/share stability. While the firm reported a 30% year-over-year decline in net revenue and a 15.5% drop in net profit margin for the March quarter, it is still committed to maintaining capital flexibility and minimizing short-term liquidation risks to protect investor value. Nano Labs Buys $50M in BNB Another company is also planning on stocking upon crypto. Nano Labs recently took its first major step toward a bold treasury strategy by purchasing $50 million worth of BNB. This forms part of its long-term plan to eventually hold between 5% and 10% of the asset’s total circulating supply. The Chinese microchip manufacturer said it plans to allocate up to $1 billion into BNB over time, and its recent acquisition brings its combined holdings in BNB and Bitcoin to approximately $160 million. Nano Labs was founded in 2019 by Kong Jianping and Sun Qifeng after their departure from the board of directors at Singapore-based hardware firm Canaan. The company went public in 2022 and specializes in high-throughput and high-performance computing chips. Despite the high-profile nature of the BNB purchase, investor enthusiasm was absent. Nano Labs’ stock dropped more than 4.7% during Thursday's regular trading session, followed by an additional 2% decline in after-hours trading, closing at $8.21. This downturn comes in contrast to the stock’s earlier 106% rally when the company first revealed plans to issue $500 million in convertible notes to fund the BNB treasury. Nano Labs stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Nano Labs has a long way to go if it wants to own 10% of BNB’s supply. The circulating supply stands at roughly 145.9 million coins with a market cap of $93.4 billion. Acquiring 10% at current prices would cost approximately $926 million. Complicating things even more, Binance’s ongoing token burns are gradually decreasing the supply, which was initially set at 200 million. A Forbes report from June also revealed that Binance and its former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao still control about 71% of the circulating BNB. Additionally, the trend of companies holding crypto in their treasuries is under increasing scrutiny. Anthony Scaramucci , founder of SkyBridge Capital, recently questioned the long-term appeal of such strategies. While Scaramucci acknowledged his bullish stance on Bitcoin, he argued that investors might ultimately prefer direct exposure to the assets rather than investing in firms that hold them. “You might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin,” he said. Figma Holds $70M in Bitcoin ETFs Earlier this week, design software company Figma disclosed in a regulatory filing that it holds close to $70 million in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and earmarked an additional $30 million in stablecoins for future Bitcoin purchases. The company submitted paperwork to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “FIG.” Figma's SEC filing (Source: SEC ) Figma reported investing $55 million into the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) on March 3, 2024. By the end of the quarter on March 31, the investment appreciated to $69.5 million, WHICH IS an unrealized gain of 26%. In addition to its ETF exposure, Figma revealed that it holds $30 million worth of the stablecoin USDC. The company’s board approved the allocation on May 8, 2025, explicitly stating that the stablecoins were acquired to be converted into Bitcoin at a later date. The filing reads that the company bought 30 million USDC at $1 per token, with the intention of reinvesting those funds into Bitcoin in the future. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley praised Figma’s strategy, and pointed out that the company now holds approximately 5% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin. He also believes that more corporations are likely to follow suit by incorporating Bitcoin into their treasury reserves.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9803/de-fi-development-corp-stock-soars-after-new-solana-purchase,"BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|BNB|SOL","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

The $300 de minimis rule eliminates taxation on small digital asset transactions. Mining and staking income are deferred until the actual sale of produced assets occurs. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has introduced comprehensive digital asset tax legislation aimed at creating practical rules for cryptocurrency users while generating $600 million in federal revenue over the next decade. The bill addresses multiple taxation issues that have created compliance burdens for ordinary digital asset users. The bill sets a $300 de minimis rule for digital asset transactions, consistent with foreign exchange regulations. The provision eliminates the tax reporting requirement for small buys such as buying coffee with Bitcoin, as long as transactions do not exceed the level or involve cash equivalents. The bill permits annual caps that limit total excluded gains to $5,000 per taxpayer, adjusted for inflation after 2026. Related transactions need to be aggregated under the draft rules to prevent abuse without diminishing the rules’ practical applicability to ordinary digital asset cos… The post Sen.

According to a July 4 X post from digital asset infrastructure company Fireblocks, the bank is collaborating with Fireblocks, Solana Japan, and Japanese tech firm TIS on a joint study assessing the viability of stablecoins in everyday financial services. Japan’s first digital bank is taking the next step in real-world crypto adoption. Minna Bank (""Minna no Ginko"") is launching a joint study with Fireblocks, @SolanaJapan , and TIS Inc to explore stablecoins and Web3 wallets for everyday payments. pic.twitter.com/codSZ58Wrd — Fireblocks (@FireblocksHQ) July 4, 2025 In a statement shared with Decrypt, bank officials have also disclosed plans to run tests around the feasibility of issuing stablecoins via Solana and evaluate how Web3 wallets can support user-friendly financial experiences. Japan’s banking sector is placing “a bigger and heavier emphasis” on areas like corporate finance and international trade, Fireblocks Chief Strategy Officer Stephen Richardson explained in a separate statement to the publisher. Richardson said Japan has “a lot of trade,” and that it is made “more effective by the easy and efficient movement of money,” pointing to stablecoins as a potential way to streamline existing processes that are usually limited by traditional banking rails. All across the globe, stablecoins are gaining traction as governments and financial institutions explore their use in payments, settlements, and trade.

Both firms have also announced plans to issue Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoins , in line with the city’s incoming regulatory framework set to take effect on August 1. Across Europe, stablecoins already play a significant role in crypto payments. A June report from Oobit showed that more than 75% of crypto transactions on its platform involved stablecoins, with retail and travel spending leading adoption in countries like Poland, Lithuania, and Germany. South Korean banks have also entered the sector, launching stablecoin initiatives through regulated channels, while in the United States, lawmakers have been pushing to finalize a federal regulatory framework as dollar-backed stablecoins continue to dominate global usage. Japan, which has recently fast-tracked efforts to regulate its cryptocurrency sector , has already seen major financial institutions begin developing stablecoin solutions of their own. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the country’s second-largest banking group, is also preparing to trial a stablecoin in partnership with Avalanche developer Ava Labs, alongside Fireblocks and TIS. According to an April report from Nikkei, SMBC’s pilot is expected to begin in late 2025 or early 2026, with full issuance planned later that year.

2025-07-04T08:51:48,"Massive Whale Transfer Sparks Buzz as Bitcoin Eyes New ATH—Will BTC Break Records This Weekend?","The post Massive Whale Transfer Sparks Buzz as Bitcoin Eyes New ATH—Will BTC Break Records This Weekend? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price is trading around $109,100, close to its recent peaks above $110,300, as it attempts to rise above the latest selling pressure. Over the past 24 hours, the crypto has fluctuated between $108,800 and $110,550, reflecting modest but sustained volatility. Its weekly move is positive, up about 1.4%, driven by renewed institutional interest via US spot Bitcoin ETFs that attracted over $400 million in inflows, led by Fidelity’s FBTC. Along with the institutions, the whales are also seen preparing for a massive move, which could deeply impact the BTC price rally. Dormant Whale Wakes Up As A Billion USDT Ready to Flood Into the Markets As the Bitcoin price is displaying acute strength despite all the odds, the market conditions and sentiments are changing very often. The market participants continue to remain unsure of the price stability after the BTC price marks new highs, and as a result, the sentiments remain neutral. Meanwhile, some interesting transfers, minting and burning have occurred in the past 24 hours, which point towards an incoming volatility. Whale Alert has been posting a series of such transactions that could change the course of the rally in the coming days. Over 200 million USDC have been minted at the treasury, and more than 300 million have been transferred to Coinbase. Besides, a billion USDT has been minted at the Tether treasury, while 500 million XRP has been unlocked from the escrow to an unknown wallet. However, the main transfer that raised many eyebrows was the BTC whale waking up after a decade. After 14 years and 3 months, a dormant address with over 10,000 BTC has transferred all the cryptos to an unknown account. Whenever long-dormant BTC wallets suddenly move, traders brace for potential volatility. Moves to the exchanges can trigger panic and selling, while on the contrary, spikes in the old wallet activity often line up with major bull runs, signalling cycle transitions or profit-taking by early adopters. What’s Next for the BTC Price Rally? Will it $110,500 Resistance This Week? The short-term price action suggests the bulls are falling weak as they approach the final resistance zone before the ATH. The token has been trying hard to pierce through the zone, but the bears are taking out the profit, causing the price to drop, preventing the breach. Now that the upward pressure has mounted, the BTC price is now feared to drop back to the local support below $107,000. In the 4-hr chart, a clear rejection can be seen from the resistance zone between $110,025 and $110,563. Besides, the MACD is about to turn bearish as the levels are close to validating a bearish crossover. Meanwhile, the Stochastic RSI has already deviated lower, substantiating the bearish claim. Therefore, even though the price attempts a rebound, the lack of bullish strength could prevent a strong and sustained breakout above the range. Hence, considering the current chart patterns and market conditions, forming a new ATH this week could be a tedious job for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally. However, changes in the sentiment occur suddenly in the crypto space, which could squash the bearish dominance over the rally.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/massive-whale-transfer-sparks-buzz-as-bitcoin-eyes-new-ath-will-btc-break-records-this-weekend/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|USDT|REGULATION","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
