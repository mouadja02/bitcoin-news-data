The company said it processed 709 assistance requests, including 124 official freeze orders from law enforcement — many tied to transnational cybercrime investigations. In total, 41 cases led to successfully intercepted assets. MEXC also launched a $100 million Guardian Fund aimed at covering losses from protocol-level breaches. This move aligns with a broader trend among top exchanges offering user protection mechanisms, following high-profile incidents such as the $70 million hack of a DeFi aggregator in May. The report also highlights expanded risk monitoring infrastructure, with 46,311 suspicious accounts restricted and 6,184 fraud rings identified in the CIS, India, and Southeast Asia — regions seeing sharp rises in coordinated wallet fraud and account takeovers. Meanwhile, MEXC continues to update its Proof of Reserves (PoR) data, listing real-time wallet balances that exceed all user deposits. As of June 26, reserves included 4,083 BTC, 69,234 ETH, and 2.32 billion USDT. The release comes as the European Union finalizes MiCA implementation standards, and as multiple Asian regulators push for “verified solvency” policies for crypto exchanges. MEXC’s transparency effort may help insulate the firm ahead of pending compliance waves. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz.

Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 WLD Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) is poised for potential price action as it aims to retest the $1.60 level. If optimistic momentum builds, a further bullish movement could lead to $2.12 level. However, if WLD fails to maintain its bullish trajectory, it risks dropping back to as low as $0.57. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) Worldcoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.57 1.60 2.12 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 In the first half of 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) continued its downward trend, particularly in Q1, where it hit an all-time low of $0.57. However, a glimmer of hope emerged in Q2 as the price attempted to rise from April onwards. Unfortunately, momentum faltered after reaching $1.62, and from the third week of May to the third week of June, the price fell to $0.79. Yet, the last week of June brought a positive shift, with improved geopolitical conditions helping the price surge to the $0.90 mark. This movement from April and June lows suggests a potential reawakening of bullish sentiment, as a slight upward trendline has taken support, hinting at a possible short-term rise. At this juncture, many are curious: what could propel Worldcoin higher? History shows that social sentiment often plays a crucial role in the crypto space. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s value. If optimistic momentum builds in the coming sessions, WLD might retest the $1.60 level in July. A further bullish movement could lead to a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure, breaking above the $2.12 level. Clearing this threshold and confirming a ChoCh could signal a breakout from its bearish pattern, potentially allowing Worldcoin to retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, caution is warranted. If WLD fails to maintain its bullish trajectory this year, it could drop as low as $0.57, reminding investors of the volatility inherent in the crypto market.

2025-07-04T09:45:35,"Nano Labs Begins BNB Accumulation with $50M Purchase","Chinese microchip manufacturer Nano Labs has officially started its ambitious plan to build a major treasury of BNB , the native token of Binance. On Thursday, the company confirmed it had acquired $50 million worth of BNB, marking the first step toward its goal of holding between 5% and 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply. Nano Labs reiterated its long-term target of spending up to $1 billion on BNB, with its latest purchase bringing its combined crypto holdings, including Bitcoin, to approximately $160 million. Founded in 2019 by Kong Jianping and Sun Qifeng following their tenure at hardware giant Canaan, Nano Labs went public in 2022 and specializes in high-performance computing chips and high-throughput computing solutions. While the company’s initial announcement to issue $500 million in convertible notes for its BNB treasury previously sent its stock soaring by over 106%, the latest purchase failed to generate similar enthusiasm. Nano Labs Aiming for 10% BNB Supply With BNB’s circulating supply at 145.8 million and a market capitalization of $93.4 billion, acquiring 10% at market rates would require around $926 million in additional purchases from Nano Labs. Binance’s ongoing token burns have steadily reduced BNB’s circulating supply, with Binance and its former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao reportedly holding a combined 71% of the circulating supply, according to a June 2024 Forbes report. A BNB Chain spokesperson acknowledged the increased institutional interest in BNB, stating, “We welcome all organic adoption that supports BNB and the sustainable growth of our ecosystem.” Crypto Treasuries Face Investor Scrutiny Despite a broader trend of companies adding crypto to their treasuries , some industry figures remain skeptical about the long-term appeal. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, told Bloomberg that while he remains bullish on Bitcoin, investors may question whether it makes sense to back a company holding crypto instead of purchasing the asset directly. “The question is, if you’re giving somebody $10 and they’re putting $8 into Bitcoin, are they going to do well? Yes. But you might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin,” Scaramucci said, emphasizing that investors must carefully evaluate the underlying costs tied to crypto treasury strategies.

2025-07-04T09:43:02,"Bitcoin is deep into its bull run, here’s what comes next: analyst","Bitcoin may be entering the final phase of its current bull cycle, with a potential market peak just months away, according to market analyst Rekt Capital. In a recent breakdown , the Bitcoin ( BTC ) analyst compared the current market structure to past halving cycles, using historical timeframes to estimate where Bitcoin stands. His analysis is based on a model where Bitcoin typically peaks between 518 and 550 days after halving, a pattern seen in both the 2016 and 2020 cycles. According to Rekt Capital, the market is roughly 88% through the typical post-halving period, now entering the later stages of the cycle. If the same trend holds, the next cycle top could fall within late September and mid-October 2025. #BTC Bull Market Progress: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 88.0% (Progress will speed up on Parabolic advances) $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/GPwGPR7Cz5 — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) July 1, 2025 While some market participants may expect the current cycle to stretch into 2026, Rekt Capital cautioned against extending expectations too far beyond historical patterns, saying that doing so could lead investors to miss the window of opportunity. One of the defining features of this cycle, according to Rekt Capital, is the longest post-halving reaccumulation period in Bitcoin’s history. For eight months after the April 2024 halving, BTC remained in a period of consolidation. You might also like: Bitcoin breaks through $107,000, is the stagnant period over? According to the analyst, this was necessary to offset the strong pre-halving upside that pushed the asset’s price significantly ahead of schedule and realign the cycle with historical trends. What comes next? With the crypto king still consolidating just below its all-time high, Rekt Capital explained that similar phases of slowing momentum or “price discovery corrections” occurred at this stage in both the 2017 and 2021 cycles. These periods often gave way to renewed momentum leading into the final phase of the bull market. However, he emphasized that as the cycle matures, the risk-to-reward ratio begins to shift. While some upside may remain, the scale of potential gains becomes smaller compared to the downside risk of a full-cycle correction. Rekt Capital cited historical drawdowns of 60–70% that followed prior bull market tops, underscoring the importance of managing risk and preparing for volatility. Rekt Capital also addressed the idea of cycle extensions, noting that while the current cycle could stretch slightly, as past ones have by around 30 days, using those assumptions to delay profit-taking carries risk. “The danger here is if we’re going to keep moving the goalpost, at some point we’re going to miss that bull market top,” he said. With that in mind, the analyst suggested sticking to past patterns, and that anything beyond the historical window should be treated as “bonus time” rather than a guarantee of further upside. The focus for investors, he said, should now shift toward preparing for that window, protecting gains, and not getting distracted by newer cycle narratives that lack historical backing. BTC has been in a steady climb over the past week, trading slightly over $108,840 at press time.

The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise.

July 2025 Price Action for HBAR As of the first week of July 2025, HBAR is trading near its upper boundary, following a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June. The price is inching closer to the $0.191 resistance level. If bullish momentum continues and HBAR achieves a daily close above this mark, it could potentially retest the resistance levels at $0.23 and $0.27 in July or the coming months. However, on the downside, failure to maintain multi-month support and rejection from the 200-day EMA could lead the price to drop toward $0.072. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High HBAR Price Prediction July 2025 $0.072 $0.191 $0.270 Hedera Price Projection 2025 Hedera experienced a volatile H1 2025. After peaking at $0.40 in mid-January, the HBAR price began a steady decline. External factors and waning investor engagement, evident in the Total Value Locked (TVL), pushed it into a converging falling wedge pattern, ultimately hitting a low of $0.125 in early April. However, the tide began to turn in the second week of April. A broader crypto rally provided a much-needed lift for HBAR. It broke free from the wedge, bouncing off a robust support zone that had previously fueled a rally in Q4 2024. This zone, validated by the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) indicator, indicated strong buying interest and set the stage for a sharp rebound. In a remarkable surge, HBAR climbed nearly 80%, rising from $0.125 to $0.228 between April and mid-May. Unfortunately, this momentum was short-lived. As geopolitical tensions escalated in mid-May, HBAR’s price retreated back to its April lows, forming a parallel declining wedge. As of the first week of July, HBAR is trading near its upper boundary. This movement follows a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June, inching closer to the $0.191 resistance level. If the bulls regain strength and achieve a daily close above this mark, HBAR could potentially retest the $0.23 and $0.27 resistance levels in July or the coming months. Looking ahead, a daily close above $0.27 in Q3 or Q4 could pave the way for a return to $0.40. If the momentum persists, HBAR might even reach $0.75 by year-end. On the downside, failing to maintain multi-month support and facing rejection from the 200-day EMA could see the price drop toward $0.072. Despite the muted price movement, Hedera’s internal developments tell a more promising story. The ecosystem continues to expand. In 2025, Hedera launched its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , along with an AI-based tool called the Hedera Agent Kit , which simplifies token creation. Another significant project, HashSphere, is set to launch in Q3 2025. This initiative aims to provide a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. Additionally, Hedera underwent a rebranding on May 15, with the HBAR Foundation now known as the “Hedera Foundation” and the Governing Council rebranded as the “Hedera Council.” This restructuring positions Hedera for a stronger future, signaling maturity within its ecosystem. In summary, while external pressures weigh on HBAR’s price, the internal progress of Hedera remains robust. If macro conditions improve, 2025 could still witness a significant turnaround for the platform.

Key Takeaways: Binance Institutional Loans let corporate clients borrow with up to 4x leverage. Borrowed funds are instantly deployed to dedicated margin accounts. Binance supports over 400 collateral assets and offers 0% interest opportunities. The product aims to boost capital efficiency for high-frequency and institutional traders who need rapid access to liquidity, the exchange said on Thursday . Unlike standard margin products tied to a single account, Institutional Loans let traders pool collateral from up to ten Spot, Cross Margin, and Portfolio Margin sub-accounts. Binance Loans Enable Instant Margin Access via Dedicated Accounts Borrowed funds are credited to a dedicated Portfolio Margin, Portfolio Margin Pro, or Cross Margin account, enabling instant deployment across Binance’s Margin and Futures markets. Borrowers can access loans between 1 to 10 million USDC or USDT, secured against net equity across their collateralized accounts. Binance’s program supports over 400 collateral assets, with major Spot tokens like BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, SOL, and BNB exempt from haircut ratios, giving clients greater borrowing power. An interest rebate program is also available, offering a path to 0% financing if performance criteria are met. To qualify, firms must complete corporate verification and meet VIP 5 trading volume thresholds or undergo a manual assessment. Once approved, they can pledge collateral, monitor loan-to-value ratios, and immediately deploy borrowed assets with spot-like latency. Introducing #Binance Institutional Loans. A cross-collateralized credit line offering up to 4x leverage across accounts to maximize capital efficiency, with interest rates that can be reduced to zero through an interest rebate program.

As reported, Binance continues to demonstrate its appeal to large market participants through Bitcoin inflows. On May 22, when Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $112,000, the average Bitcoin deposit to Binance spiked to 7 BTC, the highest among all exchanges. For comparison, Bitfinex saw an average of 5 BTC, while OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase recorded lower figures — 1.23, 0.7, and 0.8 BTC, respectively. These numbers suggest Binance is the preferred venue for whales and high-volume traders. Binance Unveils AI-Powered Customizable Interface Last month, Binance launched “Binance UI Refined,” a new app interface offering AI-powered customization that lets its 275 million users tailor their trading homepages with drag-and-drop widgets suited to their experience level and regional preferences. The redesign, announced ahead of Binance’s eighth anniversary, aims to break away from a one-size-fits-all approach. New features include AI widgets like the Trending Widget, which scans posts from X and Binance Square to highlight coins gaining social media traction, alongside real-time sentiment analysis. Other widgets let users monitor spot and futures assets, track ETF flows, follow lead traders, and access yield products. Meanwhile, Binance is also expanding into newly reopened markets.

The tweet asserted that her words go beyond speculation, describing the current developments as a “blueprint” for what is coming. XRP Governor concluded the post by suggesting that the XRP Ledger is evolving into a next-generation global financial system, with a pointed remark that the “next 12 hours” should be expected to bring significant activity, described by the influencer as “fireworks.” BREAKING: Rosie Rios, former U.S. Treasurer, just confirmed she joined Ripple specifically because of #XRP , and declared: “The government will follow.” This isn't speculation.

She directly addressed the frequent question of why she joined the company and responded by saying, “I joined the board of Ripple because XRP serves a purpose.” She clarified that XRP facilitates cross-border payments and differentiated it from digital assets that serve as arbitrary stores of value. She stated that XRP “is not some store of value kind of arbitrary value that is not pegged to anything.” Rios explained that XRP has a clear and defined utility within the financial sector, particularly in the area of international payments. “This is actually what legitimate financial institutions use specifically for cross-border payments,” she said. Rios described the innovation as transforming transactions from being measured in “days and dollars” to “seconds and cents,” which she described as the direction the financial world is moving toward. Blockchain, Government, and Institutional Lag During her remarks, Rios emphasized that blockchain and Bitcoin are here to stay. She noted that innovation often outpaces regulatory and governmental frameworks, attributing this lag to a lack of subject-matter experts within government institutions. “The unfortunate part about government traditionally is it doesn’t lead, it follows,” she said. She acknowledged the efforts of the current U.S. administration to address this gap by forming task forces and bringing expertise from the private sector into public discussions. Rios highlighted the missed opportunities of the last decade but suggested that momentum is now building, with increased regulatory clarity emerging. She suggested that, for the first time, there is a genuine convergence between regulatory interest and technological innovation.

She indicated that XRP is being utilized by serious financial players and institutions, stating it serves a “function that facilitates cross-border payments.” Her comments underscored that XRP has a clear use case grounded in improving legacy financial processes, offering a faster and more cost-effective solution. She also alluded to the regulatory green light that may happen soon, emphasizing that the landscape is shifting. “You know what four months make in terms of giving that green light for innovation to actually happen?” she asked rhetorically, suggesting that significant regulatory or institutional developments are imminent. The tweet by XRP Governor highlighted Rosie Rios’s public reaffirmation of her position on Ripple and XRP. Her perspective on the broader evolution of blockchain integration into global finance. Rios, leveraging her former role as U.S. Treasurer, framed XRP as an essential and functional component of financial modernization, not merely a digital asset among many. Her commentary stressed the accelerating pace of institutional adoption and regulatory engagement, positioning XRP and the XRP Ledger as key components in the next phase of financial system transformation.

2025-07-04T09:35:21,"The US House Designates July 14-18 as “Crypto Week”","The US House members have declared the week of July 14 as “Crypto Week,” another pro-crypto act focused on driving digital asset innovation in America French Hill, the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, and GT Thompson, the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, along with other key House leadership, endorsed this pro-innovation move on Thursday, July 3.Consequently, the US House dedicated the week spanning from July 14 to 18 to comprehensively tackling crypto-related legislation. Among the primary agenda for the week are the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC bill, and the US Senate’s GENIUS Act .A Full Week Dedicated to Driving Crypto InnovationAfter the US House of Representatives passed Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” on Thursday, their attention has now turned to crypto bills. Through a coordinated effort by the US House GOP, the lawmakers have dedicated a whole week to deliberating on and passing legislation specific to the digital assets industry. Crypto Week Agenda Notably, in hindsight, not many would have foreseen this week coming. Barely a year ago, the United States repelled cryptocurrencies under the Joe Biden administration, with former US SEC Chair Gary Gensler in power.Meanwhile, Trump is keeping to his promises of making America the crypto capital of the world. He recently called Bitcoin “amazing” and claimed he had built the crypto industry. Now, the latest US House announcement reflects that the crypto innovation push is now a national interest.US House to Approve Multiple Crypto Bills in July?The US House aims to pass the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed in the US Senate. The bill aims to establish clear guidelines for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, projected to attract trillions of dollars into the US economy. Notably, Trump has passionately called on the House to expedite the bill's delivery to him for final approval.Furthermore, the House would also attempt to pass the CLARITY Act and quickly move it to the Senate. Remarkably, the bill has already passed a vote from both the Agriculture and Financial Services Committees and now requires full House support to pass.Finally, the US House would deliberate on the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, a bill that aims to prohibit the Central Bank from establishing a digital currency. The House Financial Services Committee approved the legislation with a slim 27-22 vote in April, keeping the proposal alive.Meanwhile, several remarks followed the announcement, with several members of the House of Representatives expressing their optimism ahead of “Crypto Week.” Chairman Hill called the move a “historic step” to ensure that the United States remains the world’s leader in the crypto landscape. “We are advancing landmark legislation to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets that safeguards customers and investors,” he added.Additionally, Senator Cynthia Lummis lauded the effort of Congress to capitalize on Trump’s friendly stance on digital assets. “For the first time in US history, we have a president who sees the value in embracing digital assets,” she stated.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/04/the-us-house-designates-july-14-18-as-crypto-week/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-us-house-designates-july-14-18-as-crypto-week,"REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT","Market",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T09:30:00,"Best Altcoin to Invest in Now: These 2 Coins Will Have Bigger Gains Than Bitcoin (BTC) by the End of Q3","As Bitcoin (BTC) maintains a tight trading range at $106,900, investors are increasingly shifting their attention toward altcoins with more aggressive growth potential heading into Q3. While Solana (SOL) continues to chart a steady course in the $151 after recent volatility, it’s a new cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , that’s generating the loudest buzz across crypto forums and trading channels. Currently priced at $0.03 MUTM is moving fast through its presale phase. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 60% is already sold out because of huge demand. The project is priced at $0.03. Over $11.7 million has been raised to date and over 12,700 investors have joined. Unlike Bitcoin, whose upward potential may be tapering after its ETF-fueled highs earlier this year, these two altcoins, particularly Mutuum Finance are showing stronger upside potential through Q3 based on both sentiment and volume data. Solana Seizes Market Spotlight as BTC Trades Flat As Bitcoin lingers in the $106,000 zone, Solana (SOL) is turning heads with renewed bullish momentum, currently trading around $151.44. Recent optimism has been fueled by anticipation of the first Solana Staking ETF from Rex Shares and Osprey, which launched this week and gave SOL a roughly 5% jump to the $157–$158 range. On-chain data shows strong activity, with daily transactions at record highs and a breakout above the 200-day EMA signaling technical strength. Short-term forecasts now point toward potential upside to $165–$175 by Q3 if SOL holds support above $150. That said, it still risks dropping toward $136–$140 if bearish pressure returns. With its staking ETF debut and growing ecosystem utility, SOL is standing out among altcoins, even as some investors shift attention toward high-upside presale projects like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Reaches $11.7 Million in Funding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well on its path to being one of the hottest projects in DeFi. With an astonishing $11.7 million raised and over 12,700 investors already joining, the presale is gaining serious traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next round will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already determined official launch price of $0.06, early investors already enjoy a 100% profit before the token is even available for sale. Some even foresee a post-launch price bounce of more than $2.50 before the bull run of 2025 is finished. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users climb the ranks they will be rewarded in bonus tokens token holding fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. Mutuum Finance Announces $50,000 Bug Bounty In order to strengthen security, Mutuum Finance has already introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program together with CertiK, rewards such that every vulnerability will be rewarded in the four stages, the first level will be critical, second-level will be the major, third level will be minor, and fourth level will be low. Bitcoin may be slowing, but Solana and Mutuum Finance are gearing up for major moves. With SOL riding ETF momentum and Mutuum Finance’s presale flying past $11.7 million, these two altcoins are proving to be top contenders for outsized returns by the end of Q3. MUTM’s 100% guaranteed ROI at launch, rising token demand, and powerful DeFi model make it especially hard to ignore. If you’re looking to get ahead of the next wave of crypto growth, this may be your last chance to buy MUTM at $0.03 before the next price jump. Don’t miss out on what could be 2025’s biggest DeFi success story.

2025-07-04T09:27:27,"Where is Bitcoin Pepe headed as two dormant bitcoin wallets move BTC after 14 years","Two Bitcoin wallets that had remained inactive for over 14 years were reactivated late Thursday night, collectively transferring 20,000 BTC, worth approximately $2.18 billion at current prices. The unexpected movement of these long-dormant funds has drawn widespread attention across the cryptocurrency community. As the crypto market sees increased activity following Bitcoin’s rise past $110,000 and other new developments, several projects are gaining momentum and raising funds through presales. Bitcoin Pepe is one such project, currently in the final stage of its presale, with major exchange listings and partnerships already confirmed. Origins of the wallets trace back to 2011 According to onchain data, the wallets can be traced back to a transaction on April 3, 2011, when Bitcoin address “1HqXB…gDwcK” transferred a total of 23,377.83 BTC to three different destinations. Two of those addresses—“12tLs…xj2me” and “1KbrS…AWJYm”—each received 10,000 BTC, while the remaining 3,377.83 BTC was sent to a third address, which later moved or spent the funds within the same year. Since that 2011 transfer, both 10,000 BTC wallets had remained untouched until this week. The addresses had no prior outgoing transactions until they were both activated within 30 minutes of each other, sending their entire holdings to new, unidentified addresses. The recipient wallets have not moved the funds since receiving them. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $108,800.78, down 0.61% in the last 24 hours. The trading volumes were also slightly down to $48.05 billion. Massive value appreciation Over the 14-year period of inactivity, the value of the 20,000 BTC increased dramatically, surging from $7,800 in 2011 to $2.18 billion as of early Friday morning—a staggering 13,982,800% appreciation. The original transfer took place when Bitcoin was trading at around $0.39 per coin. Despite the scale of the movement, the identity of the wallet owners remains unknown. It is also unclear whether the two addresses were controlled by the same entity or by different individuals. Bitcoin Pepe combines Bitcoin and Solana Bitcoin Pepe is carving out a distinct space within the cryptocurrency sector by combining the viral appeal of meme culture with a development focus anchored in Bitcoin infrastructure. Functioning as a Layer 2 solution, the project builds on Bitcoin’s security framework while aiming to offer scalability comparable to networks such as Solana. This combination sets Bitcoin Pepe apart from other meme-themed crypto assets. As a meme-centric Layer 2 network built on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe is broadening its reach through a series of strategic partnerships. These alliances span various sectors, including gaming, content creation, decentralised finance (DeFi), and fair launch infrastructure, to build an ecosystem where the BPEP token delivers both cultural relevance and cross-chain functionality. These efforts are expected to support wider adoption and enhance the project’s visibility. Interest from institutional participants and the broader crypto community is growing, particularly around the emerging PEP-20 token standard. Investor engagement is evident in the project’s ongoing presale, which has raised over $16.295 million to date. The token is currently available at $0.0437, and the price is set to jump to $0.0458. Further momentum is being driven by confirmed exchange listings on MEXC and BitMart, with the final listing announcement scheduled for July 31.

2025-07-04T09:23:27,"How may the heavy demand for Bitcoin impact the Bitcoin lending market?","On July 1, 2025, major lending platform Ledn stopped supporting Ether and turned into a 100% Bitcoin-focused company. While the move aligns well with the wave of Bitcoin-mania, the same focus on Bitcoin from corporations, institutions, and governments poses new threats for the Bitcoin lending business. Full focus on Bitcoin Ledn had plans to drop support for other cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin. While Bitcoin maximalists may see it as a manifestation of Bitcoin purism, the company explained the move differently: it aims to make its product simpler and focus on excelling in the only operation type–Bitcoin lending. Regardless of the reasoning, the move is well-received among those who don’t give credit to any cryptocurrency except for Bitcoin. This audience is getting increasingly visible in this cycle. now I can start recommending Ledn again. — Brad Mills 🔑⚡️ (@bradmillscan) July 2, 2025 Ledn co-founder Adam Reeds called this transition the return to the roots. Earlier, Ledn named risk management as the reason for a future halt on using clients’ assets for yield farming. The assets are kept by Ledn itself or via the company’s partners. Bitcoin-backed loans and the current market situation In the past, the Bitcoin lending sector saw turbulence. In 2022, Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, and Genius were shut down. Ledn looks in the future optimistically as the Trump Administration’s efforts to make the crypto business less restrictive are good for Bitcoin-backed loans ventures. One of the main moves benefiting Bitcoin lending was the repeal of the SAB 121, a controversial 2022 rule that made crypto custody really hard. Read more: SEC repeals SAB 121, easing crypto custody rules Another trend that can serve as a tailwind for Bitcoin lending is the accumulation of Bitcoin by Bitcoin treasury companies, although their activity can have a negative impact too (we’ll speak about it too). Companies like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Nakamoto, Metaplanet, and others are buying Bitcoin in bulk. Governments accumulate Bitcoin they got through seizing, mining, and other means. Institutional custodians like BlackRock or Fidelity rapidly grow their Bitcoin accounts, too. All of these lock huge amounts of bitcoins out of the market, which leads to stabilizing the lower edge of the Bitcoin price, which is the perfect climate for Bitcoin lending companies. The increase in the number of Bitcoin allies among institutional investors is also vital for companies like Ledn, as lending ventures need more dollars in the sector to let more operations for more people. Even in February 2025, Reeds was stating that the lending sector is “incredibly short dollars” and needs more institutional investors to allow more people to take Bitcoin-backed mortgages, etc. Bitcoin derivatives markets (that cannot exist without Bitcoin lending) cement the BTC price stability, too. Ledn co-founder Mauricio Di Bartolomeo outlined it in his essay on responsible yield on digital assets. He writes that Bitcoin lending crushes down price volatility, makes spreads tighter, and improves the health of the spot short markets that are used as a hedge. Therefore, the market needs Bitcoin lending, and it’s another reason for companies like Ledn to come up. New threats for Bitcoin lending Everyone’s focus on Bitcoin may play a mean role for the lending sector. In the current cycle, individuals and institutions are reluctant to sell their bitcoins. Instead, everybody seems to try to accumulate as much as possible, and Bitcoin treasury companies, huge asset management companies, and governments lock up more Bitcoin than miners produce, effectively devouring liquidity. At some point, lending companies may face a situation of a Bitcoin deficit available for lending out. This, in turn, may lead to an increase in borrow rates on spot short markets, a shrinkage in short interest (it may get barely profitable), and less value clarity in the market as bearish sentiment won’t be reflected adequately on the derivatives market. This means that the price will behave less predictably, and the volatility will increase. Shorting on futures markets becomes unprofitable and riskier, too. As the Bitcoin price goes up, Bitcoin bears may lose billions in liquidations. $6,000,000,000 worth of #Bitcoin shorts to be liquidated at $120,000 👀 LET’S LIQUIDATE THEM ALL 🚀 pic.twitter.com/6lzCOud4FV — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) July 3, 2025 As the short market is shrinking and borrowing Bitcoin becomes too expensive, the options market liquidity will drop. Arbitrage trading will become less flexible, which may lead to distortion in the futures market prices as they may face higher discrepancies from the spot market. On the individual side, these problems open up more exposure to counterparty risk, trust-reliance, and the need for leverage. Ironically, all of these risks are what Bitcoin was intended to fight in the first place. Conclusion The crypto market and the broader financial market have complex structures, and every action contributes to various impacts, both positive and negative ones. Heavy demand for Bitcoin by institutions, corporations, and governments may make it hard to borrow Bitcoin. It, in turn, may negatively impact the derivatives markets and lead to price volatility and liquidations on spot short markets. This may make things worse for the actor, depending on Bitcoin reserves; that’s how this circle closes. However, as the Bitcoin price stabilizes and the regulation may get friendlier, there is hope for a positive scenario.

2025-07-04T09:20:27,"Best crypto presales to buy as the US House sets mid-July as ‘Crypto Week’","Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) are showing renewed strength heading into the weekend, with price action suggesting further upside could be on the horizon. Bitcoin broke above the upper boundary of its recent consolidation range at $108,355 on Wednesday and extended its rally by 3.64% through Thursday. As of Friday, it hovers near the $109,000 mark. If bullish momentum continues, BTC could make another attempt at its all-time high of $111,980 set on May 22. The cryptocurrency has remained above the $100,000 level since June 22, when it briefly dipped to $98,900 during heightened geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. The continued strength is also seen in the early-stage project Bitcoin Pepe . US House sets mid-July as ‘Crypto Week’ Following the passage of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill , House Republicans have slated the week of July 14 as “Crypto Week,” during which lawmakers will consider a trio of major digital asset proposals. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill (R-Ark.), and Agriculture Committee Chair GT Thompson confirmed on Thursday that the House will take up legislation addressing stablecoins, broader crypto market structure, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Financial Services GOP @FinancialCmte · Follow 🚨NEW: Chairman @RepFrenchHill , @HouseAgGOP Chairman @CongressmanGT , and House Leadership announced that the week of July 14th will be “Crypto Week,” where the CLARITY Act, Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and GENIUS Act will be considered. @SpeakerJohnson @SteveScalise 2:09 am · 4 Jul 2025 1.3K Reply Copy link Read 82 replies “House Republicans are taking decisive steps to deliver the full scope of President Trump’s digital assets and cryptocurrency agenda,” Johnson said in a statement . While there had been speculation that the House would introduce its own stablecoin bill—informally dubbed the STABLE Act—lawmakers now appear focused on advancing the Senate-approved GENIUS Act. President Trump has called for stablecoin legislation to reach his desk by August, and aligning with the Senate version could accelerate that timeline. Bitcoin Pepe stands to gain from regulatory clarity Improving regulatory clarity in the US is expected to bring greater transparency to altcoins and meme coins, potentially reshaping investor perceptions across the digital asset ecosystem. As oversight strengthens, the market may gradually pivot from speculative trading toward utility-driven narratives, creating room for technically ambitious projects that combine cultural relevance with real-world functionality. Among these is Bitcoin Pepe, a project positioned as the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network. It aims to merge Bitcoin’s base-layer security with Solana-like scalability, offering a more durable use case compared to typical meme tokens that rely solely on social momentum. Launched in February, the Bitcoin Pepe presale has continued to attract high-risk, high-reward capital and has so far raised over $16.2 million. The BPEP token is currently priced at $0.0437, with a price increase expected once contributions surpass $17.07 million. The token is set to list on BitMart and MEXC, with a final listing announcement slated for July 31. These upcoming milestones continue to drive investor attention as the presale enters its final phase.

2025-07-04T09:15:49,"Billionaire Ray Dalio Says US Unlikely To Change Debt Trajectory and Avoid a Financial Crash – Here’s Why","Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio says the US could be headed to a financial crash because political leaders are cautious against taking aggressive actions to address America’s budget deficit. In a post on the social media platform X, the billionaire says senior members of both the Democratic and Republican parties agree that the US needs to reduce its deficit to 3% of the GDP (g ross domestic product). But he says the so-called absolutist policies prevent the adoption of measures such as tax increases and cuts to benefits that can address the debt problem. “They explained the absolutist policies that must exist and those are that you must make statements like I will absolutely pledge not to raise your taxes or I will absolutely pledge not to reduce your benefits.” Dalio says it is clear that the US is unlikely to change its debt trajectory and could face painful consequences. He says political leaders may be thrown out by their constituents and face pressure from their parties, so they find it impossible to make compromising statements and actions that can balance the revenue and expenses to produce a good budget. “That’s the equivalent of saying I will absolutely pledge not to change the trajectory we’re on in order to have a better set of circumstances than the likely financial crash that we’re going to have.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-04T09:11:06,"Dogecoin to Jump to $0.42, $1.46, and $4 This Cycle: Expert","A top market analyst has suggested that Dogecoin could repeat the success of its past cycle, pushing prices to higher prices. Dogecoin, the largest meme coin by market cap, has yet to find its footing this cycle. With a stellar 5,000% and 20,000% price uptick in the previous two cycles, DOGE has been below par so far, according to its standards.Meanwhile, Dogecoin has declined 13% over the past month and corrected by 14% in June. Despite a mild 4% gain over the past seven days, the meme coin leader has declined by a staggering 46% year-to-date, a clear sign that it is well within bearish territory despite Bitcoin’s success.History Suggests a Rebound Is on CourseNonetheless, Dogecoin enthusiasts have remained optimistic that it can still post a staggering upside this cycle. Fueling this expectation is a recurring pattern on its monthly chart that shows a glimpse of its previous price development.Top analyst Trader Tardigrade highlighted this repeating pattern in a recent X post , asserting that it would significantly impact Dogecoin’s price. Specifically, he projected a rally to finally surpass the one-dollar price mark and reach new highs.Importantly, an accompanying chart highlights this recurring pattern. According to the chart, Dogecoin trended atop an ascending trendline between 2015 and late 2017 before breaking out to price levels not previously seen. Dogecoin to $4/Trader Tardigrade Dogecoin made higher highs and higher lows with the trend, moving from $0.0001 to $0.0003, then broke out to reach $0.0026. Subsequently, DOGE consolidated from the high before a final push to close at $0.009 in December 2017.Pattern Set to Push Dogecoin to $4Trader Tardigrade highlighted that a similar pattern is forming on Dogecoin’s 1M timeframe. Notably, DOGE is currently trending along the ascending trendline after forming two sets of higher highs and higher lows, ranging from $0.059 to as high as $0.4846, before retracing to its current price of $0.167. Notably, all these happened from August 2023 up until now.Meanwhile, the analyst expects the breakout phase to begin soon and highlighted three targets for Dogecoin. First, he predicts a price increment to $0.42, which is 151% away from the current price.Next, he expects a jump to $1.46, marking a new all-time high for Dogecoin. From the current price, this represents a 774% increase.Ultimately, he predicts that Dogecoin would reach an ambitious $4 by the end of this cycle, taking its market cap to approximately $600 billion. This represents a 2,295% uptick from DOGE's present market price.Interestingly, the analyst's chart suggests that Dogecoin could continue its upward trend, similar to its performance in 2021, after completing the current pattern. His chart shows DOGE can reach a ridiculous $240 price per coin.Remarkably, Trader Tardoigrade has a history of predicting ambitious targets for Dogecoin. He projected a rise to $4.5 and above in June and highlighted another recurring historical pattern on the DOGE chart that could propel a rally to $12.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/04/dogecoin-to-jump-to-0-42-1-46-and-4-this-cycle-expert/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dogecoin-to-jump-to-0-42-1-46-and-4-this-cycle-expert,"DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BTC","Market|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today",cryptocompare

Over 26,000 new Bitcoin millionaires added in first half of 2025 https://t.co/xZ5MUtFukM $BTC — Finbold (@finbold) July 2, 2025 A strong second quarter and Bitcoin’s halving in April played a major role in this spike. The halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, pushing supply pressure and sending Bitcoin prices soaring. On May 22, Bitcoin hit a high of $111,970, creating a wave of fresh wealth for long-term holders and institutional investors who bought during the dips. Trump’s Portfolio Drops While Bitcoin was climbing, President Trump’s crypto portfolio went the other way. He started the year with around $10.16 million in crypto assets. By the end of June, that figure had dropped to just $2.20 million – a loss of over 78%. Ouch. Most of the damage happened in the first quarter, with his holdings falling to $1.96 million by March. A minor recovery added back around $240,000 in Q2. But overall, the decline was sharp. A tweet by John Morgan summed it up: “Donald Trump’s crypto portfolio loses 78% of value in first half of 2025.” The biggest holding in Trump’s wallet was the meme coin TROG, worth over $800,000. Other tokens included MAGA (TRUMP), MATIC, and USDC – all considered riskier bets, especially in a market that’s shifting toward fundamentals. WLFI, Linked to Trump’s Family, Sees 115% Growth In contrast, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi platform backed by Trump’s family, has been on the rise. The platform’s value grew from $72.82 million to $178.15 million in the same six-month period, marking a gain of over 115%. WLFI’s performance was supported by institutional interest and momentum from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approvals earlier this year. Unlike Trump’s personal portfolio, WLFI appears to follow a more structured investment strategy, and it’s paying off. Hmm, interesting. New Crypto Law Could Tighten the Rules On June 23, Senator Adam Schiff introduced the COIN Act, which aims to stop government officials and their families from profiting off crypto investments. The bill would also make it mandatory for them to disclose all digital assets in their financial filings. If passed, this law could directly impact Trump and his family’s involvement in WLFI – adding regulatory pressure to the financial setback. The bill has been co-sponsored by nine Senate Democrats, which means it’s gaining the kind of momentum it needs. Strategy Over Hype The first half of 2025 has made one thing clear: structured crypto strategies are winning, while speculative meme coin plays are getting wiped out. As Bitcoin continues to mature and regulation tightens, investors, even high-profile ones, may need to rethink how they play the game.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/26000-new-bitcoin-millionaires-in-2025-but-why-is-trump-losing-money/,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T09:08:00,"Here’s How High Shiba Inu Price Could Rise If It Becomes Half as Big as Ethereum","If Shiba Inu grows to half the size of Ethereum, its price could soar to a new all-time high, offering significant returns for early investors. Since its launch in August 2020, Shiba Inu has had close ties to the Ethereum blockchain. Specifically, SHIB is an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum, meaning it could benefit directly from any increase in ETH’s value.This relationship is evident in the recent price movements of both assets. IntoTheBlock's data shows that Shiba Inu has maintained a 78% correlation with Ethereum over the past 30 days. This is significantly higher than its 41% correlation with Bitcoin during the same period. Shiba Inu correlation with Ethereum Shiba Inu correlation with EthereumIn the last 24 hours, both Ethereum and Shiba Inu have experienced price declines. ETH has dropped by 1.59%, while SHIB has fallen by 2.01%.Shiba Inu’s Price If It Becomes Half the Size of EthereumGiven Shiba Inu’s connection to Ethereum, The Crypto Basic estimated SHIB’s price if it were to grow to half the size of ETH. This scenario assumes that Shiba Inu’s market capitalization reaches 50% of Ethereum’s current value.As of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,561 with a market cap of $309.27 billion. Half of this valuation equates to approximately $154.64 billion.Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has a market capitalization of $6.9 billion and ranks as the 19th-largest cryptocurrency. SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001172, posting negative returns over the past day.Meanwhile, if Shiba Inu’s market cap were to rise to $154.64 billion, it would represent a 2,141% increase from its current valuation. This would also surpass Jake Gagain’s $100 billion projection for Shiba Inu by 54.64%.At a $154.64 billion market cap, SHIB’s price would reach $0.0002624, setting a new all-time high. At that price, 100 million SHIB tokens bought today for $1,172 would be worth $26,240, representing an ROI of approximately $25,000.Potential Timeline for SHIB to Hit $0.00026Reaching a $154 billion market cap or a unit price of $0.0002624 could be challenging for Shiba Inu due to its massive supply of 589.25 trillion tokens. Many critics argue that burning a significant portion of the supply is necessary for SHIB to reach such high price targets.Nevertheless, some market analysts have disregarded these concerns and continue to forecast SHIB’s climb toward the $0.0002 range.Crypto exchange Changelly predicts SHIB will hit $0.0002624 by April 2032, seven years from now. Meanwhile, the prediction platform Telegaon expects this target to materialize by 2028, two years earlier than Changelly’s estimate.Notably, Telegaon’s forecast aligns with one made by ChatGPT. It also agrees that Shiba Inu could reach the $0.00026 mark by 2028, coinciding with the next Bitcoin halving.Interestingly, a 2024 Forbes article suggested that Shiba Inu would climb to $0.0002624 this year, with a maximum target set at $0.0003. Additionally, analysts have speculated that SHIB could rise to $0.0002649 if it surpasses Tether (USDT) in global crypto rankings.While this analysis presents an optimistic scenario for SHIB, it is intended solely to illustrate the token’s potential if it were to grow to half the size of Ethereum. There is no guarantee that Shiba Inu will achieve this milestone.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/04/heres-how-high-shiba-inu-price-could-rise-if-it-becomes-half-as-big-as-ethereum/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-high-shiba-inu-price-could-rise-if-it-becomes-half-as-big-as-ethereum,"SHIB|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC","Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T09:01:14,"Bitcoin Analyst Warns Bull Market May End by October","Crypto analyst Rekt Capital believes Bitcoin’s current bull market could be nearing its end, predicting that a price peak may come as early as October. “We have a very small sliver of time and price expansion left,” Rekt Capital said on Thursday, comparing the current cycle to the 2020 rally. According to his analysis, the cycle may top out roughly 550 days after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. “That’s already two to three months potentially that we have left in this bull market,” he added. Debate Over Halving Cycle Relevance While Rekt Capital emphasizes the importance of sticking to time-tested halving models, others are more skeptical. He criticized the growing trend of abandoning the halving narrative in favor of newer metrics like Bitcoin’s correlation with global M2 money supply. “Many people are happy to throw away time-tested principles… whereas it’s really important to rely on these sorts of metrics,” he said. He also called the shift an emotional move that clouds sound judgment. Alternative Views Highlight Institutional Impact Some analysts argue that traditional halving cycles are less relevant today due to rising institutional interest. Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick said on Thursday that, “Thanks to increased investor flows, we believe BTC has moved beyond the previous dynamic whereby prices fell 18 months after a ‘halving’ cycle.” In May, Standard Chartered forecast Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by year-end, while Bernstein made a similar prediction. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes remains even more bullish, expecting Bitcoin to hit $250,000. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $109,155, just 2.5% below its all-time high of $111,970. Crypto analyst Crypto Auris also commented recently that, “As global money supply expands, Bitcoin’s next target sits around ~$170K, following the flow.” Analyst Emphasizes Caution Over Hype Despite the bullish sentiment from others, Rekt Capital cautions against ignoring the halving-based cycle. “It’s an emotional thing as well, and you don’t want emotional things clouding your judgement,” he reiterated.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-analyst-warns-bull-market-may-end-by-october/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T09:00:27,"Bitcoin Under Pressure As US Job Growth Slashes Fed Rate Cut Hopes – Is The Rally Over?","Bitcoin (BTC) recorded slight losses following the release of the US June employment report, which showed unemployment falling to 4.1%, compared to the consensus forecast of 4.3%. The drop in the unemployment rate is likely to prompt the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to keep interest rates unchanged, a scenario that could weigh on risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. Strong Employment Data May Hurt Bitcoin The lower-than-expected unemployment rate complicates the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions. This comes amid ongoing pressure from US President Donald Trump to implement rate cuts quickly. The robust labor market data, released today, highlights continued strength in the US economy, reducing the likelihood of an imminent rate cut. Notably, nonfarm payrolls (NFP) rose by 147,000 in June, significantly surpassing analysts’ expectations of 118,000 new jobs. With the unemployment rate falling to its lowest level since February 2025 and NFP growth exceeding forecasts, the Fed is likely to maintain elevated interest rates for longer to ensure inflation continues to trend downward. Data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) FedWatch Tool now shows a 95.3% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady at its July 30 meeting. This is substantially up from 75% before the jobs report. In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, contributor Amr Taha noted that a strong job market could hurt Bitcoin in the near term. He explained: A resilient jobs market supports a stronger US dollar, since expectations for a delayed or reduced pace of interest rate cuts make the greenback more attractive relative to other currencies. Historically, strong NFP readings and hawkish Fed expectations tend to pressure risk assets, including Bitcoin. Binance Sees Aggressive BTC Buying Activity Meanwhile, Taha also highlighted a sharp spike in Binance’s Net Taker Volume just before the release of the employment data. The metric surpassed $100 million, signaling a surge in aggressive buying activity. The jump in Net Taker Volume on Binance reflects strong bullish sentiment among Bitcoin investors and traders. For context, Net Taker Volume measures the difference between aggressive buy and sell orders on an exchange, indicating which side – buyers or sellers – is dominating market activity. Some analysts believe Bitcoin could see more upside due to its sustained positive price momentum in recent weeks. For example, BTC’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to move toward its upper trendline, a pattern that has historically preceded new all-time highs (ATHs). That said, not everyone shares the bullish view. In a recent post on X, veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez warned that Bitcoin has flashed a rare bearish signal that could push the price down to $40,000. At press time, BTC trades at $109,114, up 0.6% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-under-pressure-as-us-job-growth-slashes-fed-rate-cut-hopes-is-the-rally-over/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Donald Trump|employment data|interest rate|nonfarm payroll|US Federal Reserve",cryptocompare

Some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency’s imminent rally could target significantly higher levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Key Resistance As Price Reclaims $2,550 – Here Are The Levels To Watch SUI Eyes Key Area Reclaim On Thursday, SUI has surged more than 10% from its $2.70 support toward the crucial $3.00 barrier. The cryptocurrency has been attempting to reclaim this area throughout Thursday, hovering between the $2.95 and $3.08 levels. Notably, the altcoin ended its multi-month downtrend after breaking above its descending resistance at the end of March, fueling its rally toward the $4.29 high in May. Since the Q2 breakout, SUI has been trading within the $2.33-$4.10 range. Nonetheless, the June pullbacks, driven by the global geopolitical tensions, sent the token below the $3.00 mid-range support to its local low of $2.22 nearly two weeks ago, before reclaiming the $2.80-$2.90 area. Amid the start-of-month retracement, the altcoin briefly lost its local range, but the Wednesday pump reignited bullish sentiment and potentially set the stage for a rally continuation. Analyst Alex Clay noted that SUI is currently testing the confluence of the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) resistances alongside its bullish flag resistance. According to the chart, the cryptocurrency has been trading within a bullish flag formation since May, and lost the technical indicators throughout the June pullbacks. Now, the indicators and the patterns’ upper boundary sit as resistance around the $3.00-$3.10 area. If the altcoin reclaims these key levels, the analyst considers that a rally to the $5.00 resistance would be “an easy trade.” Is A Breakout To $10 Nearby? Analyst Marcus pointed out that SUI “just snapped back from the 0.786 Fib zone sharp, clean and confident.” He added that the cryptocurrency’s structure held despite the correction, which confirmed a “healthy pullback, not a breakdown.” To the analyst, the current bounce could be the higher low that sets the stage for SUI’s next major move, as “all signs point to a setup that’s not done yet.” Meanwhile, market Watcher Crypto Yhodda affirmed that SUI is “in a big accumulation right now,” pointing to an eight-month triangle formation. According to the analyst, a breakout from this pattern “can help it reach the dream target of $10.” Similarly, Kaleo highlighted SUI’s bounce on its trading pairs against Bitcoin (BTC) and USD. He explained that there are many similarities between the base the altcoin is currently building and the base from the April lows that propelled the token to its local high. The cryptocurrency bounced off the High timeframe (HTF) ascending support line on both occasions, suggesting a massive rally could be ahead. To the analyst, the $10 target is “a magnet.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Level Amid $108,000 Rejection, But Analysts Suggest Caution This Quarter Crypto Batman also highlighted this ascending support, noting that the recent pullback marks the third time the cryptocurrency has bounced from it since August. Following the previous two retests, the token rallied for weeks toward higher levels, signaling that a breakout could be nearby. Additionally, he considers that SUI displays a “solid-looking setup,” as it is trading above the key $2.30-$2.40 area that has served as resistance and support on the weekly chart. As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.09, a 15% increase in the weekly timeframe.

2025-07-04T09:00:00,"DeFi Development Corp Stock Soars After New Solana Purchase","This latest purchase brought its total SOL holdings to nearly $98 million. The company’s stock surged 17% on Thursday and 30% over two days, thanks to the bullish investor sentiment around its staking plans and a $112.5 million capital raise. Meanwhile, Chinese chipmaker Nano Labs revealed a $50 million BNB acquisition. The company also plans to eventually hold up to 10% of the token’s circulating supply. However, its stock dipped 4.7% despite the move. Additionally design software firm Figma revealed it holds $70 million in Bitcoin ETFs and has reserved an additional $30 million in USDC for future Bitcoin buys. This could mean that the company has a strong conviction in BTC’s long-term value. Together, these developments prove that there is a growing trend of corporate adoption of crypto assets, despite volatility fears, scrutiny from certain industry players, and mixed reactions from investors. DeFi Development Corp Shares Extend Rally DeFi Development Corp. experienced a sharp 17% rally in its stock price on Thursday after announcing a strategic $2.7 million purchase of Solana (SOL) tokens. The company revealed that it bought 17,760 SOL at an average price of $153.10 per token, bringing its total Solana reserves to 640,585 SOL—valued at nearly $98 million. DeFi Development Corp. also clarified that it plans to hold the newly acquired tokens for the long term and will stake them to generate yield. This latest surge in investor interest follows a series of strategic disclosures by the company. On Wednesday, the firm already gained market attention after releasing its June business update, which included plans to raise $112.5 million through private placements. The stock, which trades under the ticker DFDV, rose from a low of $18.47 on Wednesday to $23.80 by the close of trading Thursday. This was a 30% increase over two days. It gained an additional 0.8% in after-hours trading, ending the session at $24, according to Google Finance . While the stock is up over 2,733% year-to-date, it is still down 33% from its all-time high of $35.53 that was reached in May. DeFi Development Corp share price over the past 5 days (Source: Google Finance ) The company has some ambitious plans for the capital raised. Approximately $75.6 million will go toward funding a prepaid forward stock purchase transaction, while the remaining funds are earmarked for general corporate purposes, including additional Solana acquisitions. Although DeFi Development Corp. initially announced in April that it plans to raise $1 billion for Solana-related investments, those plans were temporarily shelved in June after a withdrawal of its SEC filing due to the late submission of a required management report. In a shareholder letter dated July 2, the company addressed the concerns about financial resilience, and explained that its balance sheet is structured to withstand prolonged market drawdowns and ensure long-term NAV/share stability. While the firm reported a 30% year-over-year decline in net revenue and a 15.5% drop in net profit margin for the March quarter, it is still committed to maintaining capital flexibility and minimizing short-term liquidation risks to protect investor value. Nano Labs Buys $50M in BNB Another company is also planning on stocking upon crypto. Nano Labs recently took its first major step toward a bold treasury strategy by purchasing $50 million worth of BNB. This forms part of its long-term plan to eventually hold between 5% and 10% of the asset’s total circulating supply. The Chinese microchip manufacturer said it plans to allocate up to $1 billion into BNB over time, and its recent acquisition brings its combined holdings in BNB and Bitcoin to approximately $160 million. Nano Labs was founded in 2019 by Kong Jianping and Sun Qifeng after their departure from the board of directors at Singapore-based hardware firm Canaan. The company went public in 2022 and specializes in high-throughput and high-performance computing chips. Despite the high-profile nature of the BNB purchase, investor enthusiasm was absent. Nano Labs’ stock dropped more than 4.7% during Thursday's regular trading session, followed by an additional 2% decline in after-hours trading, closing at $8.21. This downturn comes in contrast to the stock’s earlier 106% rally when the company first revealed plans to issue $500 million in convertible notes to fund the BNB treasury. Nano Labs stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Nano Labs has a long way to go if it wants to own 10% of BNB’s supply. The circulating supply stands at roughly 145.9 million coins with a market cap of $93.4 billion. Acquiring 10% at current prices would cost approximately $926 million. Complicating things even more, Binance’s ongoing token burns are gradually decreasing the supply, which was initially set at 200 million. A Forbes report from June also revealed that Binance and its former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao still control about 71% of the circulating BNB. Additionally, the trend of companies holding crypto in their treasuries is under increasing scrutiny. Anthony Scaramucci , founder of SkyBridge Capital, recently questioned the long-term appeal of such strategies. While Scaramucci acknowledged his bullish stance on Bitcoin, he argued that investors might ultimately prefer direct exposure to the assets rather than investing in firms that hold them. “You might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin,” he said. Figma Holds $70M in Bitcoin ETFs Earlier this week, design software company Figma disclosed in a regulatory filing that it holds close to $70 million in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and earmarked an additional $30 million in stablecoins for future Bitcoin purchases. The company submitted paperwork to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “FIG.” Figma's SEC filing (Source: SEC ) Figma reported investing $55 million into the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) on March 3, 2024. By the end of the quarter on March 31, the investment appreciated to $69.5 million, WHICH IS an unrealized gain of 26%. In addition to its ETF exposure, Figma revealed that it holds $30 million worth of the stablecoin USDC. The company’s board approved the allocation on May 8, 2025, explicitly stating that the stablecoins were acquired to be converted into Bitcoin at a later date. The filing reads that the company bought 30 million USDC at $1 per token, with the intention of reinvesting those funds into Bitcoin in the future. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley praised Figma’s strategy, and pointed out that the company now holds approximately 5% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin. He also believes that more corporations are likely to follow suit by incorporating Bitcoin into their treasury reserves.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9803/de-fi-development-corp-stock-soars-after-new-solana-purchase,"BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|BNB|SOL","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Japan’s banking sector is placing “a bigger and heavier emphasis” on areas like corporate finance and international trade, Fireblocks Chief Strategy Officer Stephen Richardson explained in a separate statement to the publisher. Richardson said Japan has “a lot of trade,” and that it is made “more effective by the easy and efficient movement of money,” pointing to stablecoins as a potential way to streamline existing processes that are usually limited by traditional banking rails.

South Korean banks have also entered the sector, launching stablecoin initiatives through regulated channels, while in the United States, lawmakers have been pushing to finalize a federal regulatory framework as dollar-backed stablecoins continue to dominate global usage. Japan, which has recently fast-tracked efforts to regulate its cryptocurrency sector , has already seen major financial institutions begin developing stablecoin solutions of their own. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the country’s second-largest banking group, is also preparing to trial a stablecoin in partnership with Avalanche developer Ava Labs, alongside Fireblocks and TIS.

Dormant Whale Wakes Up As A Billion USDT Ready to Flood Into the Markets As the Bitcoin price is displaying acute strength despite all the odds, the market conditions and sentiments are changing very often. The market participants continue to remain unsure of the price stability after the BTC price marks new highs, and as a result, the sentiments remain neutral. Meanwhile, some interesting transfers, minting and burning have occurred in the past 24 hours, which point towards an incoming volatility. Whale Alert has been posting a series of such transactions that could change the course of the rally in the coming days. Over 200 million USDC have been minted at the treasury, and more than 300 million have been transferred to Coinbase. Besides, a billion USDT has been minted at the Tether treasury, while 500 million XRP has been unlocked from the escrow to an unknown wallet. However, the main transfer that raised many eyebrows was the BTC whale waking up after a decade. After 14 years and 3 months, a dormant address with over 10,000 BTC has transferred all the cryptos to an unknown account. Whenever long-dormant BTC wallets suddenly move, traders brace for potential volatility. Moves to the exchanges can trigger panic and selling, while on the contrary, spikes in the old wallet activity often line up with major bull runs, signalling cycle transitions or profit-taking by early adopters. What’s Next for the BTC Price Rally? Will it $110,500 Resistance This Week? The short-term price action suggests the bulls are falling weak as they approach the final resistance zone before the ATH. The token has been trying hard to pierce through the zone, but the bears are taking out the profit, causing the price to drop, preventing the breach. Now that the upward pressure has mounted, the BTC price is now feared to drop back to the local support below $107,000. In the 4-hr chart, a clear rejection can be seen from the resistance zone between $110,025 and $110,563. Besides, the MACD is about to turn bearish as the levels are close to validating a bearish crossover. Meanwhile, the Stochastic RSI has already deviated lower, substantiating the bearish claim. Therefore, even though the price attempts a rebound, the lack of bullish strength could prevent a strong and sustained breakout above the range. Hence, considering the current chart patterns and market conditions, forming a new ATH this week could be a tedious job for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally. However, changes in the sentiment occur suddenly in the crypto space, which could squash the bearish dominance over the rally.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/massive-whale-transfer-sparks-buzz-as-bitcoin-eyes-new-ath-will-btc-break-records-this-weekend/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|USDT|REGULATION","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T08:50:44,"Here’s Why Bitcoin’s Price Doesn’t go up Despite Massive ETF and Corporate Buys","Early Bitcoin (BTC) whales have reportedly offloaded more than 500,000 BTC, worth about $50 billion at current rates, in the past year, an exit matched by institutional inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries. The churn, detailed in a recent Bloomberg piece, has kept the king cryptocurrency near its record highs while suppressing its more volatile nature, signaling a fundamental shift from speculative asset to institutional holding. The Great Bitcoin Handover According to Bloomberg, the BTC sales by early holders in the last year mirror net inflows into American spot BTC ETFs, indicating a near one-to-one handover. These sellers include miners, offshore funds, and anonymous wallets, many of whom accumulated their holdings when Bitcoin traded for mere hundreds. Some are now reportedly offloading their BTC for stock-linked financing deals, effectively exiting the crypto market through “in-kind” transfers. Meanwhile, institutional buyers, led by the ETFs, Michael Saylor’s Strategy, and a host of corporate imitators, are said to have accumulated nearly 900,000 BTC, pushing their combined holdings to 4.8 million BTC. This represents about one-quarter of the cryptocurrency’s 19.8 million circulating supply. Interestingly, a recent CNBC report revealed that corporate treasuries have been amassing more Bitcoin than their ETF counterparts for three straight quarters. Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows that Strategy alone holds 597,323 BTC worth over $65 billion, way more than the 527,648 BTC in the custody of governments around the world, but dwarfed by the 848,608 BTC collectively owned by public companies. Volatility Vanishing The Bitcoin sales in the past 12 months mark a dramatic powershift considering a study by Flipside Crypto estimated that five years ago, just 2% of anonymous accounts controlled 95% of Bitcoin. As DRW’s Rob Strebel told Bloomberg, “Crypto is becoming less of an outlier,” adding that the reduced volatility is a reflection of BTC’s growing status as a stable, long-term asset class. Strebel’s take on Bitcoin’s volatility wasn’t pulled out of thin air. Deribit’s BTC Volatility Index, which measures 30-day forward-looking annualized volatility expectations, has dropped to its lowest level in the last two years, potentially making Bitcoin “an attractive retirement asset,” as Arca CIO Jeff Dorman stated. BTC has displayed this steadiness at the markets recently, with a narrow 24-hour range between $108,871 and $110,386. It was trading at $109,155 at the time of this writing, reflecting a 3.5% rise in the last 30 days and a smaller 1.5% improvement over the past week to edge the broader crypto market, which went up 1.4% in that period.

2025-07-04T08:48:02,"Satoshi-era Bitcoin address moves $1 billion of BTC after 14 years","A long-dormant Bitcoin wallet dating back to the early days of the cryptocurrency has just moved 10,000 BTC , worth approximately $1.09 billion at the time of the transfer, marking one of the largest and most historically significant transactions of 2025. According to on-chain data, the wallet address 12tLs9c9RsALt4ockxa1hB4iTCTSmxj2me received exactly 10,000 BTC on April 3, 2011, when the price of Bitcoin was just $0.78 per coin. At the time, the total transaction was worth only $7,805. Bitcoin wallet address moves $1.09 billion in Bitcoin. BitInfoCharts After remaining inactive for 14 years, the coins were finally moved on July 4, 2025, when Bitcoin was trading at roughly $109,246 per BTC, netting a profit of $1,092,456,394 from price appreciation alone. The wallet has now been emptied entirely, with all 10,000 BTC transferred in a single transaction. It’s worth noting that this address had remained untouched for so long that it predates many key developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem, including the launch of major exchanges, institutional involvement, and even the creation of Ethereum. Who could own the Bitcoin wallet? While the wallet’s owner has not been identified, transactions of this size and vintage often spark speculation around Satoshi Nakamoto , Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator. However, blockchain analysts have previously mapped Satoshi’s coins and this address is not among the ones linked to the original miner. Still, the movement of such a massive amount of “virgin” Bitcoin is rare and tends to capture the attention of both the crypto community and regulators. Why now? The motive behind the transfer remains unknown, but timing may be key. Bitcoin has recently returned to above $100,000, and liquidity conditions have improved following the rollout of multiple Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. It’s possible the owner timed the move to take advantage of favorable market conditions, or to finally cash in on a decade-old investment. Interestingly, this comes just as the number of Bitcoin millionaire wallets has surged, over 26,000 new addresses holding $1 million or more in BTC were added in the first half of 2025 alone. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Despite the massive dollar value, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable in the immediate aftermath, suggesting the transaction may have been OTC (over-the-counter) or to another personal wallet, rather than for immediate sale on an exchange.

2025-07-04T08:47:09,"Strategy: Unusual Insider Purchases Support Rating Upgrade","Summary Recent insider purchases surrounding Strategy caught my attention. These purchases are unusual considering the dominating insider selling both for MSTR and also the overall market. They signal a potential shift in insiders' sentiment and outlook for MSTR. But despite the record bitcoin price, MSTR still trades at a large premium to its bitcoin holdings and book value. MSTR stock’s recent insiders’ activities I last wrote on Strategy Incorporated (MSTR) stock about 1 year ago in May 2024 with an article titled ""MicroStrategy Stock: Sell With The Insiders”. Note that the company has changed its name to Strategy recently. That article focused on the near-term risks I saw at that time, in particular the insiders’ selling activities, and concluded with a sell rating. Since then, there have been a few material changes for the stock. In the remainder of this article, I will elaborate on the top 2 on my radar: the changes in insider activities and also the new outlook in bitcoin prices. These changes lead me to see an improvement in the return/risk ratio for MSTR and an upgrade rating to hold. Let me start with the insiders’ latest disclosures. The table below summarizes the insider transactions disclosed in the past 3 months. As you can see, the transactions were still dominated by selling activities, totaling more than $40.3 million. However, a few unusual purchases caught my attention. The most recent insider purchases were disclosed by Patten Jarrod on June 9, 2025. The director of MSTR bought 5,000 of MSTR’s preferred shares at a price of ~$85 per share for a total of $425k. Shao Wei-Ming, an EVP of MSTR, also disclosed a similar purchase with a sizable total of around $300k. Overall, insiders’ purchases in the past 3 months totaled more than $2.3 million. DataRoma MSTR stock: insider purchases in focus The above transactions were unusual in my mind for a couple of reasons. First, as just mentioned, MSTR’s insider transactions used to be completely dominated by sellers as detailed in my last article. Thus, the recent insider purchases could signal of a change of sentiment among the insiders. Second, the insider activities in the overall stock market have also been dominated by insider sales lately. For instance, the next chart displays the net buy/sell transactions in the overall market in the 2 months. As seen, the picture is heavily dominated by sales shown by the red bars. Insider purchases (shown by the green bars) are so dwarfed in comparison. Although, note that the above insider purchases were for MSTR’s preferred shares. As a background, MSTR recently issued three preferred stocks, a 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (NASDAQ: STRK ), a 10% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (NASDAQ: STRF ), and a 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (NASDAQ: STRD ). Preferred shares, of course, have different characteristics when compared to the common shares. However, my view is that the preferred and the common shares are based on the same business fundamentals. As such, I consider the purchase of the preferred shares disclosed by the insiders as a reflection of improved business fundamentals for MSTR, as detailed next. Insider transactions MSTR stock: bitcoin holdings The preferred shares, together with other sources of funds (to be detailed more later), provide more financial resources for MSTR to continue to acquire Bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) and also invest in its infrastructure. Of course, such a strategy is sustainable in the long term only if BTC shows sufficient price appreciation. The developments surrounding BTC since my last writing, especially the potential policy changes from the Trump administration, have led me to feel more optimistic about the long-term potential of BTC. Thanks to the improved prospects of BTC and also the large price rally since my last writing, MSTR’s bitcoin holdings have enjoyed a drastic expansion in valuation. As seen, the company has held Bitcoin since 2020 and continued to add to its position. It currently holds 597,325 BTC with an average cost of around $70,982. With the current BTC price, this results in a significant gain of close to 55%. The current market value of these Bitcoin holdings is $65.64 billion. Source: bitcointreasuries.net Despite this substantial rise in its Bitcoin valuation, MSTR’s current overall market capitalization of $114.4 billion still is at a large premium over its direct Bitcoin holdings and/or its book value. As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin's value accounts for only about 57.4% of its market cap. In terms of book value, the current stock price represents a ratio of more than 3.55x as you can see from the following chart. Seeking Alpha Other risks and final thoughts There are certainly some reasons that could help to justify the above premium over its BTC holdings and/or book value. To start, I consider MSTR a leveraged play on BTC due to its ability to raise capital via debt, the preferred shares mentioned above, and also equity offerings. This ability to raise capital, combined with the company’s expertise to use various strategies, certainly justifies some premium. Secondly, while MSTR is almost synonymous with Bitcoin in many investors’ mind, it is fundamentally an enterprise software company with organic operating income. Its operation segments, even if overshadowed by Bitcoin, still generate revenue and profits and should, of course, add to the company’s valuation. In terms of downside risks, MSTR's cash flow from operations has seen quite small and very unstable though as you can see from its following cash flow statement. Over the past 2 years, the company reported a positive cash flow for 3 of them. In the past quarters since June 2024, the company has been reporting negative cash from operations of in the range of -$23.3 million to -$2.4 million in the most recent quarters. In the meantime, Capital expenditure has risen substantially. It totaled $1.1 million for the June and Sept quarters of 2024 but rose to $10.8 million in the December 2024 quarter and $8.7 million in the March quarter of 2025. Seeking Alpha As a result, the company has been relying heavily on debt financing. As shown in its following balance sheet, MSTR's long-term debt has surged considerably. In the past two years alone, its long-term debt has dramatically increased to the current level of $8,140 million from about $2,182 by the end of 2023. As just mentioned, such a leverage strategy is only sustainable for the long run if BTC prices keep appreciating in my model. To recap, this reexamination on MSTR (and also its associated preferred shares) is motivated primarily by changes since my last writing: the changes in insider activities and also the new outlook for bitcoin prices. After weighing these changes, I now see a better balance between its upside potential and downside risks, leading to a rating upgrade to hold.

2025-07-04T08:44:08,"Whales Are Selling Bitcoin, Companies Are Snapping Up All the Sales – What Does This Mean? Analysts Are Warning","There is a silent but effective power shift taking place in the Bitcoin market. While whales that have been holding large amounts of BTC for a long time in the $2.1 trillion BTC ecosystem are selling their assets, institutional investors such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate treasuries and asset managers are covering the majority of these sales. According to data from 10x Research, whales have dumped over 500,000 Bitcoins in the past year. That’s almost equal to the net amount of BTC flowing into U.S.-approved ETFs and very close to the roughly $65 billion BTC portfolio that MicroStrategy (now “Strategy”) has amassed over the past five years. But the sell-off has kept Bitcoin’s price stuck at $110,000. Despite rising institutional demand, volatility is gradually decreasing and Bitcoin is transforming from a speculative asset with high-yield prospects to an allocation vehicle for long-term portfolios. “We are seeing a movement at the bottom,” said Edward Chin, co-founder of Parataxis Capital, adding that this transformation is due to some whales using their BTC as collateral in direct stock-related transactions. According to Flipside Crypto, 95% of Bitcoin in 2020 was held by just 2% of wallets. But today, institutions ranging from ETFs to MicroStrategy and other institutional firms hold 4.8 million of the approximately 20 million Bitcoins in circulation, or nearly a quarter. According to Rob Strebel, director of Cumberland, DRW’s crypto arm, this development is turning crypto into a mainstream asset class and bringing with it lower volatility. In fact, Deribit’s 30-day BTC Volatility Index has fallen to its lowest levels in two years. Related News: Pantera Capital and Unexpected Altcoin Announce New Joint Investment of $250 Million But experts warn that this poses risks. The long-standing goal was to provide liquidity and an exit route for whales through institutional investors, according to Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University Washington College of Law. “That exit may now have been provided,” Allen says. Despite more than doubling the price of Bitcoin in the last two years, it has remained stagnant since entering 2025. Even US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric was not enough to push the price up. Some analysts now predict that Bitcoin's annual earnings potential could be capped at 10-20%. Arca CIO Jeff Dorman says, “Bitcoin could end up being a boring dividend stock over time. It's going up a little bit every year, but the rate of return is going down.” However, the picture is not completely clear. Not every whale movement can be tracked on-chain, and a new catalyst that could cause sudden changes in the market could emerge at any time. According to 10x Research, in the past, when whale sales were at 2% (2018) and 9% (2022), there were major crashes of 74% and 64% respectively. In a similar scenario today, the market could be thrown into disequilibrium once institutional demand stalls. “The market may be approaching its peak,” says Fred Thiel, CEO of bitcoin miner MARA Holdings. But he believes there is a different dynamic today. Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, says the transformation is long-term: “This process can take years. Bitcoin is now becoming an asset with a 10-20% return. Its nature is changing.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T08:31:32,"Time Traveler: XRP Making Millionaires and Billionaires Will Spread Quickly","In a bold post that has captured the imagination of the XRP community, prominent X user Time Traveler made a striking prediction: XRP’s rise will not only create millionaires and billionaires but will do so faster than anyone expects. “I think you underestimate how quickly XRP making millionaires and billionaires is going to spread,” he wrote. “The news and podcasts will explode talking about early investors… Conspiracies about us will spread. They will never know who we are, but they’ll know we exist. The underground syndicate of XRP.” This statement taps into a powerful and growing belief among XRP holders—that the token is on the verge of a monumental breakout that will turn early adopters into legends of the digital finance era. I think you underestimate how quickly XRP making millionaires and billionaires is going to spread. The news and podcasts will explode talking about early investors, and how could they have known? Conspiracies about us will spread. They will never know who we are, but they’ll know… — Time Traveler (@Traveler2236) July 2, 2025 From Legal Limbo to Launchpad XRP’s journey has been anything but smooth. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a prolonged legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since the agency filed a lawsuit in 2020. More recently, in June 2025, Judge Torres rejected the proposed settlement between Ripple and the SEC. Ripple would drop its counter-appeal, and it’s anticipated that the SEC will follow suit by dropping its appeal. Though the case technically remains open, the legal cloud that once hovered over XRP has largely lifted, clearing the path for broader adoption. The Early Believers Time Traveler’s message reflects the deep conviction among XRP’s earliest investors, people who have held firm through price suppression, regulatory fear, and public skepticism. Like early investors in Bitcoin or Ethereum, XRP supporters believe their patience and foresight will ultimately pay off with significant rewards. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The numbers support their optimism. Ripple has secured over 400 institutional partnerships, from central banks to global remittance firms. In Japan, XRP is already considered a financial standard, thanks in part to Ripple’s deep ties with SBI Holdings. And with XRP now listed in Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF , the asset is gaining exposure to traditional investors in regulated markets. The Hidden Wealth Class Time Traveler’s reference to the “underground syndicate” of XRP speaks to a broader cultural phenomenon in the crypto space, a quiet, decentralized wealth class that operates outside traditional financial systems. These investors are not celebrities or public figures. They’re everyday individuals who believed early, held through doubt, and are now positioned for generational wealth. As mainstream media and financial podcasts catch on to XRP’s rise, stories of overnight millionaires and early accumulators will flood the airwaves. Questions will arise: Who are these people? How did they know? Were they part of something secret? But, as Time Traveler suggests, the truth may never be fully revealed. Their identities will remain anonymous. Their foresight is undeniable, and their wealth is very real. The world will know they exist. But they’ll never know who they are.

2025-07-04T08:21:29,"Nano Labs acquired 74,315 BNB tokens worth $50 million","Nano Labs, a Nasdaq-listed company, has formally announced the start of its $1 billion Binance Coin (BNB) accumulation strategy with a $50 million over-the-counter purchase of 74,315 BNB tokens. The sale occurred at the average rate of $672.45 per token. This China-based chipmaker specializing in high-throughput computing chips used through Bitcoin mining and AI systems now has an estimated $160 million in digital assets, divided into Bitcoin and BNB. The company aims to ultimately own 5% to 10% of the total circulating supply of BNB, which will be financed using convertible notes and private placement. The BNB strategy also makes Nano the first U.S.-listed publicly traded company to regard Binance Coin as a treasury anchor. This strategy is unlike the general trend of most companies storing funds in either Bitcoin or Ethereum. As per Nano, the future purchase of BNB will be supported by zero-interest notes that can be paid in fiat or crypto, and the initial fundraising limit will be up to 500 million dollars. BNB buying spree backed by BTC liquidity The company announced that Nano Labs has raised 600 BTC or $63.6 million in its first convertible notes offering. Some of this reserve was rapidly yet strategically reflected into BNB, a reflection of a careful transition towards platform-native utility tokens. The treasury policy of the company became publicly visible when it disclosed that it had been harboring an unaccounted 400 BTC deposits in its coffers, which it had acquired at the price of $40 million. That earlier purchase predated the BNB pivot and has since grown vigorously through the new acquisition. The company said it would be making extra purchases, and its investors will get new types of convertible debt linked to Nano’s accumulation of crypto reserves. In addition to the arbitrary buildup, the shift by Nano is also positioned as its survival tool. The company recorded only $2.2 million in revenue in the second half of 2024, representing a 39% decrease compared to the previous year. The operating losses stood at $8.4 million. Still, during cost reduction programs, the losses were reduced partly by a 62% decrease in R&D. BNB price strengthens on treasury momentum BNB is performing well following the purchase by Nano Labs. The token is now emerging from a small, pinched consolidation range of $640 to $650, boosted by corporate purchases and a favorable Maxwell hard fork that brought BNB Smart Chain transaction throughput. BNB is currently trading at about $657 with its daily range of $657.85 to $664.79 at the time of press. The trading volume has declined by 5% in the last 24 hours. Technical indicators aid further upside. BNB has crossed the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has soared to 55.48, indicating moderate bullish momentum. On the weekly chart, the margin trader, The Boss, found a parallel ascending channel that BNB is still tracking. Once the breakout is confirmed, the price may go up to reach $900. Source: X Although the token is already up 18% year-to-date, it trails competitors such as Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX), which have posted a 45% and 121% increase, respectively. However, that gap can soon be filled by institutional interest. Ex-Coral Capital leaders are planning a $100 million round in a Nasdaq-traded vehicle to buy BNB to build corporate treasuries—mirroring what Nano Labs does.

It formed a double-bottom pattern with a neckline at $5.40, which coincided with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. A double-bottom pattern is one of the most bullish signs in technical analysis. Therefore, it will likely rebound and retest the neckline at $5.39, up by 56% from the current level. A move above the neckline will point to more gains, potentially to the 50% retracement point at $7.3, up by 110% from the current level. Quant price forecast QNT price chart | Source: TradingView Quant is another top crypto to buy for substantial gains. QNT has already jumped by 85% from the lowest level this year, making it one of the top tokens in the industry. Quant has jumped because of its partners, who include blue-chip companies like Oracle and Hitachi, and organizations like the European Central Bank (ECB). It has jumped above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, and is nearing the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $125.30, its highest point on June 10. A break above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $150.

It has strong technicals and fundamentals that could push it much higher. Technically, Solana has formed a bullish flag pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a descending channel. It has already moved above the upper side of the channel, confirming a breakout. Solana price has also formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, and is now attempting to move above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. A breakout will push the token to the next key resistance level at $186.7, up by 25% above the current level. A move above that level will boost the hopes of it rising to $200. Fundamentally, Solana is the second-biggest chain in the crypto industry after Ethereum. It is also a notable player in the meme coin and stablecoin industries. Chainlink LINK price chart | Source: TradingView Like Solana, Chainlink has strong fundamentals and technicals. It is the largest oracle network in the crypto industry, surpassing its top competitors, such as Chronicle and Band Protocol. It is also a major player in industries like Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization through its cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP). Chainlink also has major partnerships with companies like JPMorgan, UBS, and Swift. These companies are all building tokenized solutions using its technology. The token has also formed a bullish flag and an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, pointing to an eventual rebound, potentially to the key resistance at $18, up by 35% from the current level.

2025-07-04T08:00:34,"Analyst Sees a Bitcoin Market Shift — Here’s What’s Happening","The Bitcoin market now appears to be seeing a notable surge in its momentum, with the asset finally breaching the $110,000 mark to inch really close to its all-time high. The asset has so far registered a 24-hour high of $110,117, less than 3% increase away from its all-time high of $111,814 registered in May. At the time of writing, BTC trades back at $109,000 levels, marking a 1.3% increase in the past day. While the price action alone has fueled speculation of an imminent breakout, several analysts suggest that deeper structural shifts within the market are at play. On-chain data particularly reveals changes in whale activity, exchange flows, and stablecoin dynamics that could offer clues about the market’s next move. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm—Bitcoin Could Explode Soon Signs of Reduced Bitcoin Selling Pressure and Upward Bias CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan shared a detailed view of the current state of Bitcoin’s price structure, emphasizing a broader directional change in the market that began in April. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s recent price resilience can be attributed to a noticeable decline in selling pressure from US-based institutional investors and whales. These large players, who were previously offloading significant holdings, have shifted into accumulation mode in recent months. Dan explained that Bitcoin appears to be in a transitional phase. He observed a gradual fade in sell-side activity from major US wallets since April, and that drop has been met with stable buying pressure. This suggests that institutions are no longer offloading positions but are maintaining or adding to their holdings. Dan added that the current consolidation, marked by Bitcoin’s price hovering above the $100,000 range, is allowing short-term overheated indicators to cool down. Dan noted: While the possibility of a correction remains, the broader market direction continues to be upward, so I will maintain my perspective and look forward to the second half of 2025. Overall, this could mean that the ongoing price action in the market may be the calm before a longer-term move upward, assuming macro conditions remain supportive. Exchange Outflows and Liquidity Trends Paint a Risk-On Picture Adding further context, another CryptoQuant contributor, Novaque Research, pointed to recent shifts in on-chain flows and broader liquidity conditions. According to their data, exchange outflows have picked up notably since late June, with some days seeing over 10,000 BTC withdrawn. Such behavior typically signals long-term investor confidence and a reduced likelihood of near-term sell pressure. Additionally, the report noted that miners have remained largely inactive in terms of selling despite BTC trading above $100,000. Related Reading: Whales Are Quietly Repositioning, Here’s What Bitcoin’s $107K Price Isn’t Telling You This suggests confidence in price sustainability and possible anticipation of more favorable financial conditions. Meanwhile, stablecoin activity has also shown key changes. Both USDC and USDT supply ratios on exchanges have been trending downward since mid-June, indicating capital is sitting idle rather than flowing into spot markets. Novaque noted that investors may be on the sidelines waiting for confirmation, but the structural behavior is leaning toward accumulation.

2025-07-04T07:58:55,"$1B in Bitcoin moves from Satoshi-era wallet after 14 years of inactivity","More than $1 billion in BTC was moved from a long-dormant “Satoshi era” wallet, reactivated just as Bitcoin edges toward a new all-time high. According to blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain, the wallet moved 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.09 billion, to a new address after lying untouched for 14.3 years. On-chain records indicate that the BTC was originally acquired on April 3, 2011, for just $109,246, translating to an average acquisition price of $0.78 per coin. As such, the whale is looking at returns of over 140,000x on the initial investment. While the exact motivations behind the massive transfer remain unclear, it comes at a time when Bitcoin ( BTC ) appears poised to reach a new all-time high, with analysts anticipating the milestone could be hit by the end of this week. Currently priced at $109,100, the leading cryptocurrency is just less than 3% away from surpassing its previous high. Such movements often precede selling activity, as large investors tend to accumulate at lows and realise gains near highs. It’s possible that the whale may be moving funds from a cold wallet to an exchange or a hot wallet. You might also like: No crypto wins in Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill,’ but market eyes liquidity boost In the meantime, sentiment among large Bitcoin holders appears to be shifting more broadly. On-chain analytics from Sentora reveal that whales holding over 1,000 BTC have gradually reduced their balances in recent weeks. While such distribution could exert short-term selling pressure, Sentora analysts argue this trend may represent a positive structural shift. “Rather than signaling weakness, this redistribution reflects a maturing market,” stated Sentora. “Older ‘whale’ coins are dispersing, a dynamic that should ultimately strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.” However, data from Glassnode offers a more nuanced counterpoint. The platform’s “Liveliness” metric, which measures the degree to which BTC holders are spending versus holding, has continued to trend downward. Source: Glassnode Unlike previous cycles where profit-taking surged as prices reached new highs, current behavior suggests long-term investors are maintaining their positions, even near peak valuations. Supporting this trend, the total BTC held by long-term holders , defined as those who have held for over 155 days, has reached a record high of 14.7 million coins. Notably, most BTC that were acquired near the $100,000 breakout threshold remain unmoved, reflecting growing conviction and reduced speculative pressure among investors. Institutions ramp up their BTC buying While long-term whale holders could be positioning their holdings for a sell-off, institutional investors have been steadily increasing their exposure to Bitcoin. Over the past week, multiple companies have announced ambitious plans to establish or expand Bitcoin treasuries. These include Fragbite Group , whose stock surged 64% after revealing its intention to allocate part of its balance sheet to BTC, and Vanadi Coffee , which gained over 240% in a month following shareholder approval to invest up to $1.1 billion in Bitcoin. Other firms that are jumping in include Belgravia Hartford , which disclosed it had secured $1 million in funding to grow its BTC treasury, while Norway-based Green Minerals announced a plan to raise $1.2 billion for the same purpose. The uptick in corporate interest shows growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, especially as it edges closer to price discovery territory. It comes as a growing number of analysts project even higher targets for BTC in the months ahead. According to crypto trader CryptoFayz, if Bitcoin breaks its current all-time high of $111,960, a continuation to $116,000 is likely, citing technical chart structures. Meanwhile, long-term projections remain even more bullish. Standard Chartered and Bernstein both forecast Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, while BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has set an even higher year-end target of $250,000.

At this point, companies prefer cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and XRP for their treasury reserves. Amber Group, the crypto company that announced its $100 million reserve plan, announced that it has raised $25.5 million through a private placement to expand its Crypto Ecosystem Reserve strategy, The Block reported. The fund, raised by Amber Group subsidiary Amber International, was joined by major institutional investors including Pantera Capital, CMAG Fund and Kingkey Financial International. Amber International issued more than 12 million shares of Class A common stock on Nasdaq to raise capital. Since establishing the crypto reserve last May, Amber International has invested in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). With this capital expansion, the company plans to expand its portfolio to include Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), and Sui (SUI). “With this strategy, we aim to meet institutional demand for tokenized real-world assets (RWA) and pioneer blockchain-based financial innovation,” a spokesperson from Amber International said. *This is not investment advice.

The company has unlocked a 3,000% rally after announcing its $250M facility to build an ETH treasury. Bitmine was one of the latest treasury companies to unlock a stock rally. In the past two days alone, Bitmine rallied by more than 100%, reaching a price of $135 for the first time since April 2021. The latest stock rally launched after Bitmine announced a $250M private placement with the goal of acquiring and holding ETH. The price jumped additionally after the closing of the private placement on July 3. Bitmine rallied in the past day, following the closing of a $250M private placement deal with the goal of building an ETH treasury. | Source: Google Finance Bitmine started out from all-time lows, rising from a $1 mining stock to over $135 in the span of a week. Bitmine continues to rally as the leader to the pack of Ethereum treasury stocks , which joined the Bitcoin trend in the past few weeks. The growth trend also boosted the shares of Sharplink Gaming, rising further from $9.50 to over $12.60. SBET share prices are still down from their peak, but the recent recovery shows enthusiasm for ETH treasuries remains high. BitDigital, Inc. also rose to a one-month high of $2.94. ETH treasuries also allow companies to stake the tokens for additional passive income. Sharplink Gaming has already staked 95% of its ETH valued at over $450M. Bitmine plans dual BTC-ETH strategy Bitmine already holds 154.2 BTC, acquired at prices above $106,000 since June 16. The company has also hidden hashrate that would produce additional BTC inflows in the coming six months. Bitmine aims to use its private placement proceeds, along with BTC, to acquire more ETH and build its treasury. The company aims to acquire crypto for long-term holding, from a mix of BTC mining operations or from raising additional capital. Bitmine has direct mining operations, contracts in synthetic market, and hashrate as a financial product. Bitmine also works as a mining consultant, while also owning data centers in low-cost locations in Texas. Can Bitmine reawaken ETH? Demand for ETH has risen, based on ETF buying. The recent announcement of corporate treasuries is still not making a dent on the market. ETH remains a speculatively traded asset, with deliberate trading against long positions, leading to a depressed market price trading within a range around $2,500. ETH traded at $2,557.21, far from the exuberance of treasury company shares. The token stalled just under $2,700, falling on selling pressure. For bullish traders, ETH was supposed to make a hike to $3,000, though for now the rallies are cut short. Ethereum has seen increased staking and on-chain activity, with growing demand for DeFi. The network is slowly regaining its activity, mostly based on stablecoin usage. USDT and USDC drive traffic on Ethereum, as part of both centralized and decentralized activity. The recent treasuries are still not buying at the scale of Strategy, which is already affecting the BTC market. However, the appearance of a new wave of altcoin treasury companies may extend the 2025 crypto rally. Companies have already announced SOL and BNB treasuries, but ETH may be a prime candidate for reserves with guaranteed staking rewards. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The legislation, which promises deep tax cuts and sweeping spending reforms, is set to be signed into law on July 4 in a high-profile Independence Day ceremony. Republican Pushback Falls Short Despite Republican leadership rallying support, the bill faced opposition from within Trump’s party. GOP lawmakers Thomas Massie and Brian Fitzpatrick voted against it in the House, joining Senate Republicans Rand Paul, Susan Collins, and Thom Tillis, who opposed the bill earlier. Their concerns revolved around steep cuts to Medicaid, expanded tax breaks for the wealthy, and fears that the package could explode the national deficit. Yet, House Republicans managed to hold the line, persuading holdout Ralph Norman to flip his stance. With Vice President J.D. Vance previously casting the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, the path was cleared for the bill’s final approval. Economists Raised a Red Flag Economic analysts are sounding alarms. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the bill could add a massive $5.5 trillion to the national debt if the provisions become permanent. The U.S. debt, currently near 100% of GDP, could soar to 127% by 2034. Moody’s has also warned of growing investor unease and bond market volatility triggered by the legislation’s long-term fiscal risks. American Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unleashed a scathing attack on #DonaldTrump 's Big Beautiful Bill, warning it would strip coverage from 17 million Americans while raising taxes on those earning less than $50, 000. #BBB pic.twitter.com/U8YTkrkGzu — Good Point (@the_Good_Point) July 4, 2025 Whereas, the democrats, led by former President Joe Biden, labeled the bill “reckless and cruel,” warning it could strip healthcare from millions of Americans due to the proposed Medicaid cuts. Biden emphasized the bill favors the rich while threatening the social safety net. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, a one-time Trump ally, has voiced strong disapproval, signaling plans to campaign against lawmakers who backed it. What Comes Next? With the bill’s signing imminent, attention now turns to its implementation and its political fallout. As Trump pushes forward with his economic vision, critics are preparing for a fierce battle over the nation’s fiscal future, and voters will likely have the final say in 2026.

The founder asked how this was possible in a tweet on Thursday, joining a heated debate between Bitcoin maximalists and altcoin enthusiasts. He was particularly drawn to the conversation when a user remarked that the government can censor or seize assets on Cardano through him.“I’d love someone to explain to me” Hoskinson sought further clarification on what the user meant when he claimed that the founder can censor or freeze assets on Cardano with a directive from the government. “I’ll wait,” he added.Notably, the Bitcoin maxi’s comment came despite Cardano’s shift into a fully decentralized network in September. For context, the layer one blockchain implemented the Chang upgrade last September and entered the Voltaire era, a phase in its roadmap where power shifted to every Cardano holder, represented by stake pool operators (SPOs) and delegated representatives (dReps).Prior to the upgrade, Hoskinson and other major stakeholders of the Cardano network burned their genesis key, which offered them unique access to the blockchain. As a result, Hoskinson’s reaction expressed his surprise that someone with an understanding of blockchain technology could make such comments.Nonetheless, Hoskinson had earlier noted that it would take time for people to understand what had really happened on Cardano. He made the remark when a similar comment circulated in March. According to him, it would take years and strong media publicity for people to finally understand that Cardano is fully decentralized.How It All Came AboutThe comment originated from a clip where Robinhood’s CEO, Vlad Tenev, noted it is time to move beyond Bitcoin and meme coins to real-world asset tokenization on the blockchain. This came after Robinhood launched a protocol that allows European users to trade American stocks directly on its platform.A Bitcoin proponent, Breeadman, posted the video, triggering a debate within the crypto community. A user claimed that if RWA tokenization gains momentum, there would be no use for Bitcoin again.Meanwhile, the debate on whether governments can seize Bitcoin emerged after Breadman claimed that governments can seize tokenized stocks but cannot confiscate self-custodied BTC. When some altcoin proponents clarified that the feature applies to all other cryptocurrencies, a comment emerged that the government could pressure Hoskinson and other founders to censor or confiscate users’ assets.However, this is not possible on Cardano, following its fully decentralized feature. Hoskinson also clarified that there is no backdoor to Midnight , the forthcoming privacy-focused sidechain on the Cardano network.Remarkably, several misconceptions are widespread regarding Midnight, particularly its data-privacy claims. Some speculate that law enforcement can access users' information as part of Midnight's regulatory compliance clause and can freeze users' assets using the obtained details.In truth, Midnight can provide enforcement agencies with access to data, but only after they follow the necessary legal processes. Nonetheless, this would be a selective disclosure that does not involve confiscating users' assets.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/04/hoskinson-founder-reacts-to-claims-of-a-cardano-backdoor-that-allows-government-to-seize-users-tokens/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hoskinson-founder-reacts-to-claims-of-a-cardano-backdoor-that-allows-government-to-seize-users-tokens,"ADA|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ALTCOIN|MARKET","Market|Charles Hoskinson News|Latest Cardano (ADA) Crypto News Today",cryptocompare

According to Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service that flagged the movement, the address last saw activity in 2011 when the balance was worth just $7,793. From Forgotten to Billion-Dollar Wallet The reactivation of such an old wallet is an extraordinary occurrence. The address likely dates back to the earliest era of Bitcoin, when the cryptocurrency was trading below $1 and mining was accessible to anyone with a basic computer. Over a decade later, this same stash now commands a fortune, illustrating the remarkable trajectory of Bitcoin’s rise. The transaction did not simply signal wallet access. The 10,000 BTC was moved out of the address in an outgoing transaction, confirming that the holder either recovered access to the wallet or had been deliberately holding it this entire time. On-chain data reveals that the coins weren’t transferred to an exchange, but rather redistributed to multiple new addresses, a common practice used to enhance privacy and obscure transaction trails. A dormant address containing 10,000 #BTC (1,092,973,486 USD) has just been activated after 14.3 years (worth 7,793 USD in 2011)! https://t.co/hzeryv3B5t — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 4, 2025 Speculation and Theories Erupt The crypto community reacted swiftly to the news, with many taking to X to share theories, concerns, and jokes. Calvin Weight questioned whether movements like this are why Bitcoin doesn’t rise despite major institutional purchases, posting: “Is this why BTC doesn’t go up in price when companies are buying billions of dollars?” Pablo Heman, known as Plan A, reignited the ever-present mystery of Bitcoin’s origins, asking: “What if this is Satoshi dumping?”—a theory that gains traction every time ancient coins begin to move. Others speculated the wallet owner may have only recently found the long-lost seed phrase. Chris commented, “They finally found the seed phrase, or we are all in trouble.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adding a touch of humor, user @Clearingkarma wrote: “Ross turned into a billionaire. Much wow!”—a tongue-in-cheek reference to Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road fame, though no evidence connects him to the address. Market Reaction and Broader Implications Surprisingly, the activation had little to no immediate impact on Bitcoin’s market price . This suggests that the BTC wasn’t sold, and reflects the market’s growing maturity. Historically, when old coins are moved, it often leads to market volatility. However, with current liquidity levels, the market appears better equipped to handle such movements without significant price swings. Still, the event highlights the ongoing mystery and legacy of Bitcoin’s early adopters. Whether this was a lost key finally recovered or a long-held strategic move, the sheer scale of the fortune involved serves as a stark reminder of the wealth still locked away in the blockchain’s early blocks. For now, the identity of the wallet owner remains unknown, but the crypto world is once again reminded that Bitcoin never forgets.

According to a July 4 analysis published on CryptoQuant by contributor Axel Adler, Chainlink ( LINK ) wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million LINK, often categorized as whale addresses, have now accumulated more than 85 million tokens. Since late 2022, this is the highest amount of whale-held supply. In contrast, retail holders have remained largely inactive, creating what Adler calls a “standoff” between deep-pocketed investors and smaller participants. This quiet accumulation phase has not yet translated into significant price movement. At press time, LINK is trading at $13.48, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours and about 7% lower over the past month. Over the last seven days, it has moved within a tight range between $12.76 and $13.96.

The relative strength index is near 50, indicating neutral momentum, and the MACD is slightly bullish. LINK is displaying some short-term strength, currently trading slightly above both its 10-day and 20-day moving averages. However, it remains below longer-term averages such as the 100-day and 200-day, indicating that the market is still hesitant . LINK may move toward $15 if it breaks above $14.10 with strong volume. On the other hand, it might fall towards he $12.50 level if it falls below $13.00. For now, the market appears to be waiting to see if retail traders or whales will determine the next move.

This new financial product could reshape Japan’s fixed-income market. With interest rates in Japan staying historically low, MetaPlanet plans to offer yen-denominated securities with high annual yields of 9 to 10 percent, using Bitcoin as collateral. The Problem in Japan’s Financial Market Crypto expert Adam Livingston explains that Japanese households hold over 2,200 trillion yen in financial assets. A large portion of this money is sitting in cash or deposits that earn less than 0.23 percent interest. Meanwhile, Japan’s annual inflation rate stands around 3.5 percent. In October 2024, it was 2.3 percent. It peaked at 4 percent in January 2025 and then stayed between 3.6 and 3.7 percent in the following months. This means most savings are losing value in real terms. The yield on Japan’s 10-year government bond is currently at 1.45 percent. In March, it was slightly higher at 1.63 percent. Japanese life insurers, who manage about 390 trillion yen, are now seeking better returns to meet long-term obligations. Livingston also notes that regulators in Japan are encouraging the development of new financial products that offer higher returns without adding foreign currency risks. MetaPlanet’s Solution: Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Stock MetaPlanet aims to address this issue by launching a preferred stock backed by Bitcoin. The stock will be issued in Japanese yen and offer high yields of 9 to 10 percent annually. Bitcoin is known for its long-term price appreciation and is often seen as a hedge against inflation. This makes it an attractive asset to back fixed-income securities. [post_titles_links postid=”478498″] Strategic Growth and Bitcoin Accumulation MetaPlanet is already a major Bitcoin holder, with at least 13,350 BTC, valued at over $ 1.45 billion. Livingston says the company can use funds raised through these preferred stocks to buy more Bitcoin. As their Bitcoin holdings grow, the value of the collateral increases. This could allow MetaPlanet to reduce coupon rates in future offerings and lower its capital costs. The company’s long-term goal is to accumulate 210,000 BTC , which would comprise approximately 1% of the total Bitcoin supply . A Major Shift in Japan’s Financial System Livingston believes this new offering is not just another product. It represents a major shift in Japan’s financial system. A yen-denominated, Bitcoin-backed investment could provide better yields for savers, modernize capital markets, and avoid the risks of foreign currency exposure. This move could set a new standard for fixed income investments in Japan. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs Why is MetaPlanet launching Bitcoin-backed preferred stock in Japan? MetaPlanet is addressing Japan’s financial market issues, where over 2,200 trillion yen in savings earn less than 0.23% interest while inflation runs around 3.5%. This new product offers significantly higher returns (9-10%) and is encouraged by regulators seeking new, higher-yielding, non-foreign currency risk financial products. How much Bitcoin does MetaPlanet currently hold? MetaPlanet is a significant Bitcoin holder, currently possessing at least 13,350 BTC, valued at over $1.45 billion. The company aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC, which would represent approximately 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, using funds raised from these preferred stocks to expand its holdings. How will MetaPlanet’s Bitcoin-backed preferred stock benefit Japanese savers and the financial system? This new offering provides Japanese savers with much higher yields than traditional deposits or government bonds. It’s expected to modernize Japan’s capital markets by introducing a yen-denominated, Bitcoin-backed investment, offering better returns while avoiding foreign currency exposure, potentially setting a new standard for fixed-income investments.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/metaplanet-to-launch-bitcoin-backed-stock-offering-10-yield-in-japan/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN","News|Fintech Company",cryptocompare
