2025-07-04T18:45:05,"US Dollar Primed To Weaken Further Amid the Worst First-Half-Year Performance Since 1973: S&P Global","The US dollar just had the worst first-half-year performance in over 50 years and is likely to weaken even more, according to the financial data and analytics firm S&P Global. In a new report, S&P Global says the US dollar is rapidly weakening due to tariffs, threats to the Federal Reserve’s independence, rising US debt and inflation fears. “The US dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of its currency peers, has fallen about 10.8% since the start of the year. That marks its worst first six months of a year since 1973. The greenback now sits at its lowest levels since February 2022 and stands to weaken further, according to currency strategists.” The US dollar’s plummeting began after US President Donald Trump took office in January. Says Derek Halpenny, managing director and head of research with MUFG Bank, “The trigger for the move may have been uncertainties over the policy outlook, on trade in particular, but the erratic nature of policy formation as well.” Elias Haddad, a global macro strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman, says that the US dollar is suffering from various factors that are likely to cause “structural drag” over the long term. “By all measures, the dollar dominates on the international stage as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. However, loss of confidence in US trade, fiscal, and security policies, and political meddling with the Fed’s independence threaten to accelerate the dollar’s declining role as the primary reserve currency.” The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading at 97.03 at time of writing.

After years of dedicated work in Congress on digital assets, we are advancing landmark legislation to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets that safeguards consumers and investors, provides rules for the issuance and operation of dollar-backed payment stablecoins, and permanently blocks the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to safeguard Americans’ financial privacy. I thank my colleagues in Congress and the Trump Administration for their partnership and leadership and stand ready to work alongside the Senate as they work to advance standalone market structure legislation by the end of September.” Added Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, “House Republicans are taking decisive steps to deliver the full scope of President Trump’s digital assets and cryptocurrency agenda. During ‘Crypto Week,’ the House looks forward to the timely consideration of three landmark pieces of legislation: the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the Senate’s GENIUS Act.

Quant ( QNT ) was trading at $105 on July 4, up over 75% from its lowest level this year. This rally has brought its market capitalization to over $1.2 billion, ranking it as the 60th largest coin in the industry. Quant Network gained traction earlier this year when Oracle launched the Oracle Blockchain Platform Digital Assets Edition using its technology. OBP DA is an enterprise-grade solution designed to streamline the development and deployment of digital asset applications. It simplifies and accelerates tokenization efforts by integrating a robust distributed ledger infrastructure with pre-packaged smart contracts. Oracle utilizes Quant’s Overledger solution in this product.

There is optimism that the ECB may also adopt Quant’s Overledger solution. Overledger is a blockchain-agnostic operating system that enables interoperability between blockchain networks and traditional systems. Quant’s price may also benefit from the development of Fusion, a framework designed to secure assets, data, and logic across both public and permissioned distributed ledgers. Fusion’s Devnet launched last week, with the testnet scheduled for release this month. The mainnet is expected “within months,” to be followed by the mainnet+. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows that the supply of QNT tokens on exchanges has dropped to 1.64 million, its lowest level since May 25, a sign that investors are moving their tokens into self-custody wallets. QNT exchage balances | Source: Santiment Quant price technical analysis QNT price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart indicates that QNT bottomed at $59.25 in April and rebounded to $120 in June. It has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, characterized by two distinct swings and a rounded bottom. The recent retreat represents the handle portion of this formation. The distance between the cup’s upper and lower bounds is approximately 50%. Projecting this same distance from the upper boundary points to a potential rally toward $180, representing a 71% gain from the current level. However, this bullish forecast would be invalidated if the token drops below the support level at $85.78.

2025-07-04T18:18:57,"This Critical Binance Metric Suggests Incoming Surprises for Bitcoin: What You Need to Know","Binance’s net taker volume surged past $100 million just ahead of the latest US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report. Such a trend points to aggressive buying as traders position for a key macroeconomic catalyst. Binance Sees Aggressive Buy Orders In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant revealed thaft this spike reflects large market buy orders on Binance, indicating strong bullish sentiment or speculative bets on continued market momentum. The US labor market report, released shortly after, showed Nonfarm Payrolls increasing by 147,000 in June. This figure exceeded analysts’ expectations of 110,000-118,000. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1% from 4.2% in May and was the lowest level since February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The stronger-than-expected employment data reduces the chances of near-term rate cuts, ultimately backing the Fed’s plan to maintain higher rates to control inflation. Market-implied probabilities now reveal a 95% chance the Fed will hold rates steady at its July meeting, as it rose from 75% before the jobs report was released. A resilient jobs market has strengthened the US dollar, as expectations of delayed or reduced interest rate cuts make the currency more attractive relative to others. Historically, strong NFP data and hawkish Fed expectations have weighed on risk assets, including Bitcoin, as a firmer dollar environment tends to reduce the relative appeal of alternative assets. The combination of Binance’s aggressive buy-side activity and the strong jobs report could pave the way for potential volatility in crypto markets as traders assess the Fed’s policy outlook and the broader macro environment. After US jobs data beat forecasts, Bitcoin briefly climbed above $110K before retreating to $108.8K. July Seasonality Fuel Optimism As per crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades’ observation, holding above $108K is critical for the leading crypto asset to avoid a downward spiral. He considers a close near the $110K region a healthy sign. Meanwhile, Matrixport noted that July has historically been a strong month for Bitcoin, as 7 out of the last 10 Julys have closed positively and have an average return of over 9.1%. Supported by the improving Fed outlook and post-July 4 optimism, the next few weeks could offer a final push higher before another round of consolidation. The Greed & Fear Index is also bottoming out, a signal that often precedes upward momentum in Bitcoin’s price.

2025-07-04T18:10:45,"Bitcoin Whales Splash $3.8 Billion During Market Dip While Small Traders Flee in Panic","Bitcoin (BTC) traded relatively flat on Friday, extending its week-long consolidation as the market grappled with mixed signals. Adding to market uncertainty, reports emerged that Binance was offloading Bitcoin . On February 10, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan further flagged a dormant Bitcoin wallet that moved 14,000 BTC after being inactive for 7 to 10 years. This development raised speculation about potential sell-offs. However, Julio Moreno, another analyst at CryptoQuant, refuted these claims, stating that on-chain data did not indicate any unusual activity in Binance’s reserves. “Some talk about Binance moving its assets. Looking into our on-chain data, the exchange’s reserves don’t show any odd behavior. Bitcoin reserves drawdown is in line with what other exchanges are experiencing,” wrote Moreno. Despite these bearish signals, Bitcoin whales have taken advantage of the dip to accumulate significant amounts of BTC. On-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock reported that large investors purchased nearly $3.8 billion worth of Bitcoin during the recent downturn. Notably, on February 5, a net inflow of approximately 40,000 BTC was recorded, indicating strong accumulation by deep-pocketed entities. This trend aligns with a sharp decline in Bitcoin Over the Counter (OTC) desk balances, as noted by CryptoQuant analyst Darkforst. According to Pundit, institutional investors, such as hedge funds and governments, have increasingly turned to OTC desks to acquire Bitcoin without influencing market prices. This surge in demand has driven OTC balances down from approximately 480,000 BTC in September 2021 to just 146,000 BTC today. The ongoing depletion of OTC reserves indicates a sustained interest in Bitcoin among institutional investors. If this trend persists, buying pressure may shift directly to exchanges, positively influencing Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Meanwhile, on-chain data from Santiment has revealed notable divergences in network activity among major cryptocurrencies. On Thursday, the firm noted that while Ethereum and XRP continue to see wallet growth, Bitcoin has experienced a decline of 277,240 non-empty wallets over the past three weeks. According to the firm, this drop appears to be driven by small traders exiting the market amid concerns about further price declines across the cryptocurrency sector. It, however, noted that historically, such downturns in retail participation have signaled strong mid- to long-term price performance, as whales and sharks accumulate coins and strategically drive markets higher when fear and uncertainty peak. However, cautionary signals remain that could hinder Bitcoin’s immediate recovery. Analysts at IntoTheBlock identified a significant resistance level formed by 1.6 million addresses collectively holding around 1.57 million BTC at an average purchase price of $97,200. With many of these holders currently at a loss, the analysts warned that this cohort may opt to sell near breakeven, introducing additional selling pressure and complicating any decisive bullish breakout. At press time, BTC was trading at $107,900, reflecting a 1.78% drop in the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-whales-splash-3-8-billion-during-market-dip-while-small-traders-flee-in-panic/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T18:00:39,"Macro Meets Crypto: Predicting Prices with CPI, Fed Rates & BTC Dominance","Institutional money has changed how crypto trades. Bitcoin and Ethereum now respond to economic news in ways that mirror traditional assets. Reports on the CPI, inflation, and interest rates move prices. This shift means macroeconomic indicators are no longer optional for crypto traders. They are part of the core playbook. This article explains how official data on inflation, central bank rates, and crypto-specific indicators like Bitcoin dominance can help anticipate market trends. The analysis draws on macro releases, crypto charts, and research from large trading desks. The goal is not to predict exact moves but to offer a practical guide to understanding how broader economic trends shape crypto performance. Inflation and Bitcoin: CPI’s Growing Grip on Crypto Inflation started rising sharply in early 2022. The Consumer Price Index , reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, reached nine percent year-over-year in June. Bitcoin fell six percent within three days of that release. Investors moved out of risk assets, expecting tighter financial conditions. This pattern continued through 2023 and 2024. When CPI came in lower than forecasts, Bitcoin often rebounded. For example, in November 2022, the month-over-month print was 0.1 percent against a forecast of 0.3 percent. Bitcoin gained nearly four percent within two days. CPI for all items rises 0.1% in May; shelter up #BLSData https://t.co/dJyJeKmvth — BLS-Labor Statistics (@BLS_gov) June 11, 2025 This repeated reaction suggests Bitcoin now trades more like tech stocks. It does not act like a hedge against inflation in the short term. Instead, it follows interest rate expectations. If inflation readings push the Federal Reserve toward cuts, traders often rotate into crypto. If inflation jumps, traders exit fast. CPI for May 2025 showed price growth slowing toward the Federal Reserve’s target. If that trend continues, investors may add risk again. However, if energy costs or wages lift inflation above forecasts, expectations may shift back toward tightening. Traders will likely adjust positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum based on these releases. CPI releases now act as drivers of short-term price direction. Fed Rates and Ethereum: Liquidity Cycles in Action The Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in March 2022. That cycle lasted until mid-2023, with the target range reaching 5.25 to 5.5 percent. Each increase indicated tighter liquidity. Ethereum often fell in the days following these announcements, mirroring declines in growth-focused equities. Ethereum Price 2022 (Source: CoinMarketCap) Ethereum’s sensitivity to rate decisions became clear in several key moments. After the June 2022 hike of 75 basis points, ETH dropped by over eight percent within 48 hours. The same pattern repeated in September. By contrast, when the Fed paused in July 2023, ETH rebounded by nearly five percent over the next three trading sessions. However, one exception came in March 2023. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic in financial markets. The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points but indicated it might stop soon. That shift helped ETH recover as it climbed from under $1,400 to over $1,800 within three weeks. These events show Ethereum’s link to monetary policy. Rate hikes tighten conditions and push ETH down. Pauses or signs of easing often lead to sharp rebounds. Ethereum trades like a proxy for risk appetite in a liquidity-driven market. Bitcoin Dominance: Crypto’s Own Macro Gauge Bitcoin dominance tracks the percentage of total crypto market value held in Bitcoin. When dominance rises, it often reflects a retreat to safety. During periods of macro tightening, investors reduce exposure to smaller tokens and move capital into Bitcoin. This behavior mirrors broader risk-off patterns. U.S. Interest Rate 2015-2025 (Federal Reserve Bank) From late 2021 through 2022, Bitcoin dominance climbed from under 40 percent to nearly 48 percent. That move came during sharp inflation spikes, and a series of Fed rate increases as the market pulled back from speculative assets. Dominance rose again in mid-2023, just before the Fed indicated a pause, and fell shortly after. This pattern supports a familiar cycle. In early risk-on phases, Bitcoin leads. Once it stabilizes, capital rotates into Ethereum, then into altcoins with lower market value. Drops in dominance often mark the beginning of these rotations. The index can act as a sign of changing sentiment within the market. Bitcoin dominance reflects how crypto investors respond to broader economic shifts. It can function like a barometer—trending upward when uncertainty grows and falling when conditions favor higher risk exposure. Institutional Macro Forecasts and the Next 90 Days Institutional research over the past year has increasingly tied macro indicators to digital asset performance. In an October 2024 report, Crypto.com Research stated: “Economic growth may generally indicate a more favourable environment for cryptocurrencies, but the impact will vary depending on other market conditions.” They noted that “increasing correlation between traditional markets and cryptocurrencies means that stock market performance may potentially provide valuable insights into potential crypto trends.” Looking ahead, the next 90 days include several macro events that could affect crypto direction. The July CPI data is due on August 12, with consensus forecasting a YoY increase of 2.8 percent. The next FOMC meeting is on September 17, where markets currently price a 25 basis point cut. The August nonfarm payroll report (due September 6) and Q2 GDP revision (August 29) also stand out as volatility triggers. These dates offer key decision points. A lower CPI print could reinforce Fed easing expectations and push capital into risk assets. On the other hand, a stronger-than-expected payroll may reduce those expectations. ETF-related flows and crypto-native reactions will likely hinge on these cues, reinforcing the case that macro indicators now drive the broader crypto narrative. Conclusion: A Macro-Informed Strategy Macroeconomic indicators now play a measurable role in shaping the crypto market direction. Inflation data, central bank policy , and internal metrics like Bitcoin dominance have shown clear relationships with past price shifts in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. These signs, when aligned, can offer a grounded framework for interpreting future moves. While no model captures every turn, tracking CPI releases, FOMC decisions, and market reactions allows for more informed positioning. Macro data will not replace crypto-native analysis, but it adds a broader context that is becoming harder to ignore. Keeping an economic calendar in view may prove as useful as any technical chart.

2025-07-04T18:00:04,"Bitcoin Whale Activity Heating Up As Big Investors Load Up On Long Positions","Just when the crypto market seemed like the bear market phase was about to begin, Bitcoin , the largest digital asset, has rallied hard, revisiting key price levels such as the $110,000 mark . As BTC’s price has surged sharply, whale investors are exhibiting significant optimism about the asset’s short-term prospects. A Sign Of Bold Bets Among Bitcoin Whales Bitcoin is riding a bullish wave following a renewed bullish market sentiment, causing its price to rise above the $109,000 level. Presently, whales are once again taking risks and increasing their long bets as the price of BTC undergoes a spectacular ascent. This bullish behavior among whales or big investors was announced on the X platform by Alphractal, an advanced on-chain data analytics and investment platform. According to the on-chain platform, BTC whales are in full force of the trend. The expert highlighted that these big investors’ aggressive long positions are constantly piling up while short positions are getting liquidated. Specifically, the aggressive positioning of major investors suggests that they have rekindled their belief in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory and are placing bets on even higher valuations in the future. With BTC’s price rising and whales ramping up long positions, this paints a positive outlook for the flagship asset in the short term. In the meantime, a strong undercurrent of confidence is added to the market as these big players stack leveraged bets in favor of further gains, which might pave the way for the next explosive leg-up for Bitcoin. Alphractal observed the development after examining the Whale Position Setiment metric. BTC Whale Position Sentiment is a key metric that monitors orders totaling more than $1 million. Also, the metric is considered one of the most powerful and alpha-rich indicators in the broader derivatives market . The on-chain platform stated that the metric is frequently strongly linked to the price behavior of Bitcoin, as big investors control the majority of the global trading volume. Should this trend extend alongside a continued BTC rally, it could act as a springboard to a major rally, with the flagship asset reaching a new all-time high in the upcoming weeks. BTC’s Price New Direction Is Upward After a notable bounce, Bitcoin is now challenging key resistance levels as it surges to its current all-time high. Crypto Dan, a market expert and author, has shared insights on BTC’s recent move, claiming that the direction has already shifted toward an upside trajectory. “Looking at Bitcoin’s movements from last April to the present, it appears that the market direction has shifted upward,” the market expert stated. Since April this year, the expert highlighted that US whales and institutions have been steadily reducing their selling pressure, as indicated by the red arrow on the chart. Meanwhile, their buying pressure is being maintained within the yellow box. According to Crypto Dan, Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase where short-term overheating is being resolved. Although there is still a chance for a pullback, the expert claims that the overall market trend is still upward, underlining his confidence toward the second half of 2025.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whale-activity-heating-up/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto Dan|derivatives market|Whale Position Setiment Metric",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T17:56:56,"Brussels court delivers justice in crypto abduction case","Brussels Criminal Court sentenced three kidnappers to twelve years imprisonment each. They attacked crypto entrepreneur Stéphane Winkel’s wife outside their Forest home. The December 20, 2024, crypto abduction forced the couple to relocate completely. Winkel abandoned his cryptocurrency YouTube channel following the traumatic kidnapping attempt that devastated their lives. Brussels court delivers justice in crypto abduction case The 47th Chamber of the Brussels Criminal Court sentenced three kidnappers to twelve-year prison terms. They abducted Stéphane Winkel’s wife in a coordinated assault in front of their residence in Forest. The kidnappers abducted the crypto billionaire’s wife on December 20, 2024. Police officers acted swiftly following Winkel’s report to the authorities regarding the crypto kidnapping. The police pursued the getaway van along Belgian roads for approximately an hour. The chase stopped after the car had an accident near Bruges, leading to arrests. Court hearings revealed that the masterminds of the operation remain unidentified and at large. Three convicted defendants claimed that they were issued death threats forcing them to participate. Judges dismissed such allegations as empty during court hearings. Objects seized during searches: DH News One youth was also part of the kidnapping conspiracy and has separate juvenile court cases. The convicted kidnappers owe more than one million euros in civil restitution. The restitution is paid directly to the traumatized victims for what they went through. The Winkel family suffered tremendous psychological trauma following the December attack. They were forced to move out of their Forest home owing to continued security threats. Stéphane’s wife cannot work anymore after the traumatic experience of being kidnapped. The crypto business owner chose to abandon his popular YouTube channel completely. He had previously given free cryptocurrency tips to interested viewers on a daily basis. Winkel said that he had to protect his family and minimize public exposure. The attempted kidnapping stole their freedom and safety forever. Global surge in crypto-targeted abduction cases Cryptocurrency holders across different countries are exposed to increasingly violent crime targeting their virtual wealth. Several high-profile abductions were carried out in 2025, which is an ominous development in crypto violence. Paris saw a series of assaults on crypto influencers in May 2025. The father of a French crypto millionaire was kidnapped with the kidnappers demanding 5-7 million euros ransom. The kidnappers amputated one of the victim’s fingers to compel cooperation. French police freed him after 58 hours and arrested five suspects . A second Paris meeting on May 13 involved the crypto CEO’s grandchild and daughter. Three men in masks attempted to abduct them at gunpoint but were thwarted. The kidnap attempt was thwarted by the child’s father and other passersby. David Balland, Ledger wallet company co-founder, was the victim in January 2025. Kidnappers kidnapped Balland and his business partner from his home in central France. The kidnappers demanded 10 million euros and amputated one of Balland’s fingers. The victims were later released, with several suspects in custody. New York City experienced extended cases of torture against crypto millionaires. Italian crypto investor Valentinoofr Carturan was kidnapped for 17 days. Other crypto investors tortured him by hanging him, subjecting him to electric shock, and threatening him with chainsaws. They tried to make him disclose Bitcoin wallet credentials with a value of 28 million dollars. Belgian authorities arrested ten French suspects in March to abduct a relative of a crypto entrepreneur. Investigators found equipment designed for the installation of a torture chamber, pointing to the planned nature of such crimes. Security concerns bring about lifestyle changes for crypto entrepreneurs Cryptocurrency millionaires and their families are more under scrutiny than ever before to change their public image. The Winkel kidnapping case shows the effect of violent crime on the owners of cryptocurrency beyond monetary loss. Victims are faced with tough decisions between business and security. Stéphane Winkel closed down his popular YouTube channel after his wife attempted to kidnap him. Earlier, he provided free cryptocurrency advice to thousands of subscribers in regular videos. It was his primary means of engagement with the cryptocurrency community. The entrepreneur listed family security as his top priority after the December attack. Social media promotion and educational materials posed safety threats. Winkel conceded that success with cryptocurrencies drew unwanted attention from criminal networks. Criminal organizations increasingly probe crypto entrepreneurs through their online interactions and social media remarks. Public social media pages, YouTube accounts, and public speaking at conferences are treasure troves of information for potential attackers. The online history helps criminals identify wealthy targets and their families. The psychological impact on crypto families is more widespread than immediate trauma from assaults. Most successful crypto investors today have personal security or relocate to safer jurisdictions. Others forego public-facing business operations entirely in order to reduce risk. North American and European police forces record rising attempts at crypto abduction. Criminals target owners of cryptocurrencies as valuable commodities with liquid funds hard to track. The distributed nature of virtual money makes recovery challenging for victims. Security experts now counsel crypto business operators on best security practices in operations. They encompass restricting public exposure, changing daily habits, and maintaining family protection measures. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-04T17:51:52,"Crypto wrap: Bitcoin drops to $107k as ETH, XRP and SOL give up gains","The cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn on Friday, July 4, 2025, with Bitcoin price dropping from highs of $110,000 as the total market capitalization slipped to $3.3 trillion amid a 2.5% decline over the past 24 hours. Global crypto liquidations stood at $209 million, but were down 28% in the past 24 hours. As several coins dipped, the global trading volume decreased 32% to $95 billion, indicating a dip in interest. Losses came as Bitcoin holders beheld a staggering transfer of coins that had been dormant for over 14 years. Bitcoin price drops as 14-year dormant wallets move 80,000 BTC As noted above, Bitcoin dropped from highs of $110k to trade around $107,600 at the time of writing. This decline, while catalyzed by the broader market outlook that saw stock futures fall on Friday, also came amid a notable Bitcoin ecosystem development. Notably, eight dormant wallets, which have been dormant since 2011, collectively transferred 80,000 BTC valued at over $8.6 billion. “Among these wallets, two received their $BTC in early April-2011 when the price was $0.78, while the other six received in May-2011 at $3.37 per BTC. The total value then was just $217.8K,” Spot On Chain wrote on X. The coins moved to other wallets and not exchanges, suggesting the whale behind the Satoshi-era coins might be reallocating.

Top altcoins pare gains – ETH, XRP, and SOL fall to support levels As BTC pared gains, major altcoins also faced pressure. Ethereum (ETH) dropped 3.6% to $2,484, testing, and XRP retreated 1.7% to $2.21. Both ETH and XRP were holding above critical support levels, as Solana (SOL) declined 3.4% to $145. This broad-based top altcoins correction reflects profit-taking, but analysts remain bullish amid a market sentiment that is buoyed by anticipation around spot exchange-traded funds. ETH could yet spike above $2,500 and target highs above $3,000. SOL recently rallied as the first Solana spot ETF with staking went live. Ripple’s network growth, with significant partnerships in place, also means buyers are optimistic about XRP. Ondo Finance agrees to buy Oasis Pro In a significant development for tokenized securities, Ondo Finance announced its acquisition of Oasis Pro, an SEC-registered broker-dealer, Alternative Trading System, and Transfer Agent, on July 4, 2025. This move equips Ondo with the necessary licenses and infrastructure to expand its tokenized financial ecosystem in the U.S. Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance, highlighted the acquisition as a step toward a regulated tokenized securities market, with Pat LaVecchia of Oasis Pro joining the team to lead the integration. The deal, backed by investors like Mirae Asset Ventures, underscores growing institutional adoption of blockchain technology.

2025-07-04T17:50:23,"Trump’s crypto project WLFI faces its first real decentralization stress test","A governance vote to make WLFI tokens tradable is underway and will reveal whether the project is truly community-driven. But the bigger question is whether early backers are ready to cash in, or hold tight, as the team’s holdings remain frozen. On July 4, the team behind Trump-linked World Liberty Financial launched a pivotal governance vote , proposing to unlock tradability for its WLFI token. If passed, early supporters who bought tokens in WLFI’s closed-door funding rounds will see their holdings unlocked for the first time, while the team, founders, and advisors remain bound by longer lockups, a move framed as a test of the project’s commitment to decentralization. The proposal outlines a phased transition to open-market participation, beginning with token transferability and a limited distribution. A second vote will later determine if and when the remainder of early supporter allocations can be released. At face value, the first vote represents a routine governance milestone for a DeFi project. But in practice, it probes the fragile balance between ideology, liquidity, and control that defines WLFI’s unique place in the crypto ecosystem. You might also like: Over $1b flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs as macro sentiment improves Why this vote matters now and what’s really at stake The World Liberty Financial team cites “strong demand” from community members and ecosystem partners as the key driver behind the timing of the WLFI token tradability proposal. After a year of product development and brand-building, the protocol claims the foundation is stable enough to open the gates. The WLFI team calls this a “defining moment,” and in some ways, it is. If passed, the vote would mark a transition from a controlled, non-transferable token model to one where WLFI can circulate freely via peer-to-peer exchanges or secondary markets. Yet the timing is conspicuous. The vote comes just a week after Aqua 1’s $100 million token purchase , which granted the UAE fund significant governance influence. The WLFI team has not disclosed how many tokens Aqua 1 controls relative to total supply, but the optics are hard to ignore. A freshly onboarded institutional player now holds outsized voting power in what is being framed as a grassroots governance milestone. Regardless of the outcome, the vote is a revealing moment for World Liberty Financial, which is under scrutiny to prove its ecosystem can balance open participation with sustainable growth. Proponents argue that enabling trading will fuel broader adoption and governance engagement. Skeptics, however, warn that early backers—many of whom bought in at lower valuations, could trigger a sell-off, testing the token’s resilience before institutional players like Aqua 1 fully deploy their capital. The outcome won’t just shape WLFI’s liquidity; it will signal whether a project with political ties can withstand the pressures of true decentralization.

2025-07-04T17:50:12,"Trending Alternative Crypto to Dogecoin (DOGE) Set to Turn $650 into $65,000 in 4 Months","The post Trending Alternative Crypto to Dogecoin (DOGE) Set to Turn $650 into $65,000 in 4 Months appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Few tokens have stirred as much chaos and charm as Dogecoin. What started as a joke became a global phenomenon, fueled by memes, retail fervor, and the occasional tweet from Elon. But as DOGE continues to trade sideways, a fresh contender is making waves—one that isn’t just riding the meme wave but building a whole new surfboard. That contender is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . And if early indicators hold, this isn’t just another frog-themed token—it could be the next explosive altcoin to rival DOGE, SHIB, and even PEPE in both returns and cultural relevance. With three sold-out presale stages this June and a fourth now live at just $0.0013 per token, LILPEPE’s trajectory isn’t just bullish—it’s breakneck. Presale Frenzy Fuels Conviction Interest in Little Pepe has escalated at an unprecedented pace. The project’s first three presale phases sold out in a matter of days this June, underscoring widespread demand. Now in its fourth stage at just $0.0013 per token, the presale has already drawn more than $2.8 million in contributions as we enter the third quarter of 2025. Such rapid capital accumulation demonstrates investor confidence and provides a war chest for audits, mainnet deployment, and strategic partnerships that will reinforce LILPEPE’s market position. Road from $650 to $65,000 A $650 investment at the current $0.0013 price nets you 500,000 LILPEPE tokens. If the token hits just $0.13—a realistic scenario in a meme bull market—that position turns into $65,000. Skeptical? Don’t be. We’ve seen meme tokens do far more with far less. PEPE did it in weeks. DOGE did it in months. And LILPEPE isn’t starting from scratch—it’s beginning with momentum, a roadmap, real tech, and a hyper-engaged community that understands how to drive narrative. This is how outsized returns are made in crypto—not by waiting two years for a blue-chip to grind up slowly, but by finding the next catalyst before it explodes. An Anonymous Veteran’s Perspective A veteran Bitcoin investor who built his fortune during the early Bitcoin rallies has flagged Little Pepe as a rare opportunity with outsized profit potential. He remains unnamed by choice, preferring to let the project’s fundamentals speak louder than any personality. According to his assessment, the absence of buy or sell taxes, paired with anti-sniper launch safeguards, positions LILPEPE to capture genuine investor interest rather than fleeting, bot-driven spikes. The $777,000 Giveaway: A Marketing Masterstroke As if that weren’t enough, LILPEPE has rolled out a $777,000 giveaway to energize the community and attract new eyeballs. Ten winners will walk away with $77,000 in LILPEPE tokens, a prize pool that surpasses most of the other presales. But the giveaway is more than just a prize. It’s a signal—a declaration that this isn’t just another “launch and vanish” project. It’s designed to scale fast, hit hard, and reward the early believers who dare to leap before the rest of the market wakes up. How to Participate in the Fourth Presale Stage Joining the fourth presale stage of Little Pepe is straightforward. Download a Web3 wallet such as Trust Wallet, and fund it with ETH or USDT using the standard ERC-20 protocol. Proceed to the official littlepepe website to purchase your LILPEPE tokens at $0.0013, and confirm the transaction. Within moments, LILPEPE tokens appear in your wallet, granting immediate visibility ahead of the full presale wrap. A New Chapter Awaits Little Pepe is more than a fleeting meme; it’s the vanguard of a new meme finance era. By tackling Ethereum’s scaling challenges with a dedicated Layer 2 solution and embedding governance rights for token holders, LILPEPE transcends the ordinary hype cycle. For investors who recognize pattern shifts and seize discounted entry points, the next four months present a window to turn a modest stake into life-changing gains. As the presale clock winds down and the mainnet launch approaches, the question shifts from “if” to “when.” For believers who act decisively, Little Pepe could prove to be the defining trade of 2025.

2025-07-04T17:38:12,"Are Whales in Trouble? BTC Derivatives Flash Mixed Warnings","Bitcoin whales , big holders of the cryptocurrency, have been seen as major influencers in the market. Their movements often foreshadow broader trends, but recent developments in Bitcoin derivatives are raising questions about the stability of the current market. With large-scale shifts and mixed signals from key trading indicators, the market is bracing for potential turbulence. Whale Activity: A Double-Edged Sword On-chain data shows that Bitcoin whales, specifically those holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, have been accumulating in recent weeks. However, this accumulation isn’t all clear sailing. Recent developments in the derivatives market are offering a more complex picture. Despite the bullish behavior of whales, there are signs of caution elsewhere in the market. The derivatives market, which allows traders to speculate on future Bitcoin prices, is flashing a series of mixed signals. One key indicator is the Binance Liquidation Delta, which has seen consistent long position liquidations in recent days. Some of these liquidations have been massive, sometimes exceeding $40 million, which suggests that leveraged traders are unwinding positions. While this could be seen as a market correction or short-term volatility, it is also a sign of caution among traders who may be preparing for a downturn. However, this figure has dropped from 8%, signaling a potential loss of bullish momentum. The reduced premium suggests that traders might not be as confident about future price increases as they were before. Another important metric is the Exchange Whale Ratio, which tracks the amount of BTC entering exchanges compared to the total inflow. This ratio has been climbing, indicating that large transactions are dominating exchange volumes. Such activity is often associated with profit-taking or repositioning of assets, a move that could signal whales’ intentions to exit the market or minimize exposure to Bitcoin. Crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live highlighted strong bearish sentiment among traders in its recent market update. Traders are reportedly growing frustrated with the market’s stagnation, as volatility remains high, but price movements are muted. This could signal that while large players continue to accumulate, smaller traders are hedging their bets, potentially indicating a market in transition. All these factors come together to create a somewhat uncertain environment for Bitcoin. While the growing accumulation by whales indicates long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value, the increased caution in the derivatives market suggests that traders are bracing for a correction. Bitcoin’s price has been fluctuating around $109,500, just under the $110,000 resistance level. It’s currently in the upper range of its channel, and many traders are eyeing key levels, such as $108,890, which is critical for a bullish weekly close. In a market where Bitcoin’s price is susceptible to external movements, including those by large holders, this situation could trigger short-term volatility. The ongoing liquidation of leveraged positions, combined with the rise in the Exchange Whale Ratio, suggests that a shakeout may occur before any further upward momentum. With the mixed signals from the derivatives market and the continued whale accumulation, Bitcoin’s future price direction remains uncertain. If whales continue to hold and the derivatives market stabilizes, Bitcoin could see further growth. However, if the caution in the derivatives market persists, a short-term correction may be on the horizon.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/are-whales-in-trouble-btc-derivatives-flash-mixed-warnings/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T17:30:07,"Altcoins Are Staging a Rival Rally to Bitcoin's Dominance. Which Will Lead the Charge in July?","As Bitcoin holds its ground , other digital currencies are making significant moves. Excitement builds as alternative coins show potential for a remarkable surge. The upcoming month of July promises new leaders in the crypto arena. Readers will discover which altcoins are poised for impressive growth and could challenge Bitcoin's dominance. Ethereum Price Trends and Key Levels Analysis Ethereum saw a slight dip over the last month with a price drop of about 0.48% while showing a modest weekly gain of 7.21%. Over the past six months, the coin experienced a broader decline of roughly 28%. Price movements have been mixed, with short-term recoveries contrasting against the longer-term slump, underscoring the coin’s sensitivity to market pressures and oscillating sentiments. The current trading range for Ethereum sits between approximately $2111 and $2870. Key support is found at $1735.41 with additional backing near $975.87, while resistance levels are marked at $3254.46 and a secondary barrier at $4013.99. The market shows no clear dominance by bulls or bears. Momentum reading at 180.06 and an RSI near 57.27 indicate some buying activity, while the Awesome Oscillator leans bearish at -16.3795. Trading strategies may focus on buying near support at $1735.41 and selling near resistance at $3254.46, with opportunities for swing trades in the absence of a clear trend. XRP Price Trends: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Correction Over the past month, XRP gained approximately 4.67% and experienced a 5.17% increase over the last week. In the last six months, the token declined by about 6.37%, indicating a period of overall correction despite the recent rebound. The coin has shown short bursts of momentum against a backdrop of prolonged bearish trends. Price oscillations have been notable, with incremental advances in recent weeks contrasting with earlier declines. The market experienced phases of recovery interspersed with cautious retracements, reflecting short-term optimism and mid-term pressures. Recent behavior suggests improving sentiment, even while historical data underscores ongoing challenges, indicating a coin in a state of flux. Currently, the coin trades between $1.98 and $2.41, with immediate resistance at $2.59 and a secondary barrier around $3.02. Support is identified at $1.73, with further cushion near $1.31. Recent gains highlight buyer interest, yet sellers remain active near key resistance levels. A lack of a clear, sustained trend offers trading opportunities within this range. Buyers may seek entries around the $1.73 support, while a break above $2.59 could set the stage for targeting $3.02. Short-term trades may leverage price movements around these levels, though caution is warranted due to mixed technical signals and the influence of longer-term downturns. Cardano's Price Movements: Analyzing Recent Market Behavior Cardano has shown marked fluctuation with a weekly rise of nearly 7% followed by a 12% drop over the last month and an even steeper decline of 44% over the past six months. The price trended between $0.48 and $0.70 during this period, with intermittent rises that could not sustain momentum. Price levels have consistently tested nearby resistance around $0.83 while responses near support levels around $0.38 and $0.16 hint at possible buying interest. Data reflects a period of significant adjustment and retracement, with technical indicators pointing to uncertain market sentiment as the coin struggled to reclaim higher territory. The coin’s current trading range between $0.48 and $0.70 emphasizes key technical levels. A primary support is found near $0.38 with a second level around $0.16, while resistance is seen near $0.83 and again at $1.05. Bullish activity appears near the lower support as buyers may step in, but bearish pressure persists, keeping the overall trend unclear. Oscillators and a balanced RSI of approximately 50 highlight a market in limbo. Traders could consider short-term buying opportunities near support if the price holds and monitor any breakthrough toward resistance. Attention to these defined zones may offer clear entry and exit points as mixed signals suggest a cautious approach amid ongoing market fluctuation. Conclusion ETH , XRP , and ADA are showing strong performance and could be key players. ETH's ongoing upgrades make it a serious contender. XRP's legal victories boost investor confidence. ADA's tech developments increase its appeal. Together, these factors make it likely that one or more of these coins could lead in the coming weeks. Keep an eye on their performance as July progresses. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-04T17:25:36,"Satoshi-Era BTC Wallets Spring to Life, Move $2.18B in Rare On-Chain Shuffle","Two Bitcoin (BTC) wallets that had been untouched for over 14 years suddenly moved their entire holdings of 20,000 BTC, worth around $2.18 billion, in a pair of rare transactions late Thursday. On-chain data shared by Lookonchain shows that each wallet shifted 10,000 BTC within half an hour of each other, as they surprised market watchers who closely track such “Satoshi-era” movements. Bitcoin OG Moves The wallets originally received the bitcoin on April 3, 2011, when the price was just $0.78, meaning their holdings had appreciated by nearly 140,000 times since purchase. At the time, the combined stash was worth about $15,600. The identity of the wallet owner or owners remains unknown, and it is unclear why the funds were moved now after over a decade of dormancy. Such large, aged movements are rare and often trigger speculation about early miners, lost wallets being recovered, or potential institutional-grade sales. Although there has been no indication yet of a sell-off. In fact, Bitcoin’s price remained stable following the move, as it held above $108,000. Market analysts are watching whether the world’s largest cryptocurrency can build enough momentum to test its record highs near $118,000 amidst the sudden reawakening of these early wallets. “Rare and Meaningful On-Chain Footprint” According to CryptoQuant, the transaction patterns suggest these movements are likely genuine transfers with the intention to trade, rather than internal wallet reorganizations or security-related address changes. This event could even mark the largest on-chain transfer by holders inactive for over a decade, surpassing the previous record of 3,700 BTC moved during the market’s bottom following the FTX collapse. CryptoQuant, however, said that assuming all activity by old holders is automatically bearish for the market is incorrect and added, “At this point, the intent behind today’s move remains unclear. What is clear, however, is that this is a rare and meaningful on-chain footprint – and one that could potentially signal increased volatility in the near future.” The post Satoshi-Era BTC Wallets Spring to Life, Move $2.18B in Rare On-Chain Shuffle appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/satoshi-era-btc-wallets-spring-to-life-move-2-18b-in-rare-on-chain-shuffle/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T17:24:08,"Pepe price holds bullish structure despite market conditions: why a reversal can occur","Pepe is showing signs of strength as it forms a potential higher low at key support. With dynamic support intact and multiple confluences, a bullish reversal may be brewing. Despite broader market volatility, Pepe ( PEPE ) is showing early signs of a potential bullish reversal. The price action has respected a key dynamic support zone while simultaneously retesting a bullish order block that previously acted as resistance. These technical signals, combined with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, suggest that Pepe may be forming a higher low, a structurally bullish sign if confirmed in the coming sessions. Key technical points Dynamic Support Holding: Price has formed consecutive higher lows along a rising trendline. Bullish Retest of Order Block: Rejection from value area high has led to a healthy pullback to a former resistance zone, now acting as support. Confluence with 0.618 Fibonacci: Further validates the support zone for a potential bounce. PEPEUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView After recently rejecting from the value area high, Pepe rotated back into a structurally significant support zone, a bullish order block that previously served as resistance. This pullback can be interpreted as a bullish retest unless invalidated. The rejection from the value area high was not followed by aggressive selling, suggesting buyers are still active and defending key zones. Supporting this bullish thesis is the presence of a dynamic ascending support line that has been respected since the last swing low. Each corrective move has found buyers along this trendline, and the most recent dip has once again tested this level. This repeated defense reinforces the higher low narrative, keeping the bullish structure intact. You might also like: Ethereum price action confirms bull trap at $2,550: major support level lost Adding further weight to this zone is the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, which aligns closely with both the bullish order block and the dynamic support line. This triple-confluence zone forms a strong technical foundation for price to bounce. If Pepe holds above this cluster of support, the odds of a bullish rotation toward the previous swing high increase substantially. While the overall market may remain in a corrective phase, Pepe’s localized structure remains intact. This suggests the altcoin is in a healthy consolidation within a broader uptrend, as long as price remains above the dynamic support. A breakdown below this level would invalidate the bullish setup, but for now, the trend structure remains positive. What to expect in the coming price action If Pepe holds above the dynamic support and confirms a higher low, expect a potential rotation toward the previous swing high. A breakdown of this level, however, would shift the structure to neutral or bearish.

2025-07-04T17:20:18,"Why Bitcoin Could Plummet To $90K Thanks To President Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’, According To Billionaire Hayes","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is still extremely bullish on Bitcoin , but he believes the apex crypto could briefly plunge and retest $90,000 levels this year if President Trump’s Big, Beautiful spending bill is signed into law. In a July 2 blog post entitled “Quid Pro Stablecoin,” the African-American crypto billionaire said that the president’s budget mega-bill — which aims to slash taxes and increase the debt ceiling — could result in the U.S. Treasury borrowing more. The bill cleared Congress on July 3 after passing the House of Representatives on a narrow 218-214 vote. Notably, financial analysts estimate that the bill could increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over a decade. President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law on Independence Day. “Proceed With Caution” Hayes argued that the Treasury would refill its General Account, causing a potential liquidity drain from markets — and in turn impacting the price of assets such as Bitcoin. This drain, estimated to be about $500 billion, could temporarily drag Bitcoin’s price to the $90,000 to $95,000 range. “Proceed with caution,” Hayes posited, adding that “the bull market might be interrupted for a short period of time.” Bitcoin was trading for $109,025 per coin at publication time after barely moving over the past 24 hours. The crypto is up over 1.9% in the last seven days, according to data from CoinGecko, and is still 2.6% away from its May historic high of $111,814. Despite potential short-term correction, Hayes — now the chief investment officer at the VC firm he co-founded, Maelstrom Fund — remains upbeat about Bitcoin’s long-term price action, suggesting that a smooth market absorption of the bond issuance could keep Bitcoin stable above $100,000. The former BitMEX CEO previously predicted that the U.S. central bank’s monetary policy, specifically money printing, would eventually be a boon for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Earlier last month, Hayes forecasted that Bitcoin would skyrocket in the coming months to smash $250,000 before the end of 2025. The rocket surge will be bolstered by the U.S. Federal Reserve accelerating money printing to curtail the ballooning national debt.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/why-bitcoin-could-plummet-to-90k-thanks-to-president-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-according-to-billionaire-hayes/,"BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT","Bitcoin|News|Arthur Hayes|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump",cryptocompare

However, Lightchain AI is igniting a different kind of fire—one that smaller investors are eagerly running toward. Having completed all 15 presale stages and now entering the Bonus Round, Lightchain AI offers a compelling AI-native blockchain platform featuring a dedicated virtual machine and a consensus model rewarding meaningful computational work. As its July 2025 mainnet launch approaches, Lightchain AI is gaining traction by combining solid technology with accessible entry points, capturing the imagination and capital of a new wave of investors seeking real innovation. Bitcoin Influences Overall Market Sentiment and Trends Bitcoin (BTC) is influencing the general market sentiment and trends. As the first and most popular cryptocurrency, its price also has a bearing on investor sentiment and market dynamics. The price of Bitcoin can fluctuate in a range, and these fluctuations could affect the rest of the market, as typically altcoins follow the movements of Bitcoin. Just as an example, when Bitcoin is rallying high, altcoins can be pumped and the price can witness an appreciation too. Similarly, dips in Bitcoin can trigger sales across the entire market. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s dominance (BTC.D) – its share of the total cryptocurrency market cap – is also a sentiment and market conditions indicator. High dominance is a sign of investor confidence in Bitcoin and altcoin price growth, but a lower dominance level could mean altcoins are about to pop or that interest in the crypto market is dropping. In this sense it is important to follow Bitcoin to fully comprehend and even predict what the synthetic market is up to. Lightchain AI Ignites Interest Among Smaller Investors Lightchain AI is igniting interest among smaller investors by offering a highly accessible and transparent platform built on strong technical foundations. Its low-latency architecture ensures smooth and rapid execution of AI tasks, providing a seamless user experience even for those new to blockchain investments.

By combining cutting-edge technology with fair tokenomics and an inclusive Bonus Round offering fixed pricing, Lightchain AI appeals to a broad audience beyond just large players. This balanced approach fosters community growth, empowering smaller investors to participate confidently in the evolving decentralized AI ecosystem. Why Lightchain AI Is Capturing Everyone’s Attention Lightchain AI is turning heads, and for good reason. By blending real-world utility with flawless execution, it’s attracting a wave of new market participants. After raising an impressive $21.1 million across 15 structured presale stages, the project has entered a fixed-price Bonus Round that’s pulling in buyers focused on long-term value. What sets Lightchain AI apart? Transparent governance, decentralized validator nodes, and soon-to-be-released public GitHub repositories show they’re ready to hit the ground running. Developer grants and the live Meme Launchpad are fueling innovation and empowering builders to create within an active ecosystem. This combination of cutting-edge tech, fairness, and accessibility is drawing interest from retail and institutional investors alike.

In a move poised to reshape the institutional crypto landscape, Binance has recently unveiled two significant developments: the launch of its dedicated institutional loans service and the strategic appointment of a new Head for Europe and the UK. These initiatives underscore Binance’s commitment to expanding its reach and catering to sophisticated financial entities, signaling a maturing market and increased institutional interest in digital assets. Unlocking Liquidity: What Are Binance’s Institutional Loans? For too long, institutional players have sought more flexible and robust financial instruments within the crypto space. Binance is stepping up to fill this void with its new institutional loans offering. This service is specifically designed to provide substantial liquidity to high-net-worth individuals and corporate clients, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the dynamic world of digital assets. Key Features of Binance Institutional Loans: Significant Capital Access: Clients can borrow up to $10 million in stablecoins like USDT or USDC. This substantial sum provides the necessary capital for large-scale operations without liquidating their crypto holdings. Flexible Leverage: The service offers up to 4x leverage, allowing institutions to amplify their trading positions or operational capital with greater efficiency. Attractive Interest Rates: A standout feature is the potential for zero interest, depending on the specific terms and collateral arrangements. This can significantly reduce the cost of capital for borrowers. Diverse Collateral Options: Loans can be secured against a variety of major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB). This flexibility allows institutions to utilize their existing digital asset portfolios effectively. Targeted Clientele: The service is exclusively available to VIP 5+ clients and corporate entities, ensuring that it caters to professional users with established financial needs and compliance standards. Cross-Collateralization: A particularly innovative feature is the ability to enable cross-collateralized borrowing across multiple accounts. This streamlines the borrowing process for complex institutional structures and offers greater capital efficiency. This offering is a game-changer for institutions looking to maintain exposure to their core crypto assets while accessing immediate liquidity for operational expenses, market opportunities, or hedging strategies. It’s a clear signal that the demand for sophisticated crypto loans is growing, and Binance is at the forefront of meeting that demand. Strategic Leadership: Why Gillian Lynch’s Appointment Matters for Binance Europe Beyond financial products, leadership is crucial for navigating the complex global regulatory landscape. Binance has made a significant move by appointing Gillian Lynch as its new Head of Europe and UK. This appointment is not just about filling a role; it’s a strategic declaration of intent regarding Binance’s commitment to regulatory compliance and growth in key European markets. Who is Gillian Lynch? Gillian Lynch brings a wealth of experience to her new role. Her background includes: Former Gemini Executive: Her tenure at Gemini Exchange, another prominent crypto platform, provides her with direct experience in the operational and strategic challenges of a global cryptocurrency business. Central Bank of Ireland Expertise: Crucially, her experience with the Central Bank of Ireland offers invaluable insight into financial regulation, compliance frameworks, and navigating the often-stringent requirements of European financial authorities. This dual experience makes her uniquely qualified to lead Binance’s efforts in a highly scrutinized region. What Does Her Role Entail? As Head of Europe and UK, Gillian Lynch will be instrumental in: Overseeing Operations: Ensuring the smooth and efficient functioning of Binance’s services across these vital markets. Driving Regulatory Engagement: Her primary focus will be to foster strong relationships with regulators, ensure compliance with evolving laws, and advocate for clear, supportive regulatory frameworks for digital assets. This is particularly critical as Binance Europe faces varying regulatory landscapes across different countries. Strategic Growth: Identifying and capitalizing on opportunities for expansion and market penetration in one of the world’s most economically significant regions. This strategic hire underscores Binance’s proactive approach to regulatory challenges, aiming to build trust and legitimacy in key jurisdictions. The expertise of Gillian Lynch will be pivotal in shaping Binance’s future interactions with European and UK authorities, potentially setting new standards for compliant crypto operations. The Broader Impact: What Do These Moves Mean for the Crypto Market? Binance’s latest announcements are more than just internal corporate developments; they carry significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market and its ongoing maturation. Benefits for Institutional Adoption: Increased Confidence: The availability of tailored institutional loans from a major player like Binance can instill greater confidence among traditional financial institutions considering crypto exposure. Enhanced Liquidity: By offering robust crypto loans , Binance contributes to overall market liquidity, making it easier for large players to enter and exit positions without significant price impact. Regulatory Clarity: The appointment of a regulatory expert like Gillian Lynch signals Binance’s commitment to compliance, which can pave the way for more widespread institutional adoption by reducing perceived risks. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead: While these moves are positive, challenges remain. The regulatory environment in Europe is fragmented, and navigating it requires constant vigilance. Competition in the institutional crypto space is also intensifying, with other exchanges and DeFi protocols vying for market share. However, these challenges also present opportunities for Binance to: Set Industry Standards: By leading with compliant and innovative products, Binance can influence how institutional crypto services are developed and regulated globally. Bridge Traditional and Digital Finance: Offerings like institutional loans directly appeal to the needs of traditional financial entities, fostering greater integration between the two worlds. A Glimpse into the Future of Finance The dual announcements from Binance – the expansion of its institutional loans program and the strategic leadership appointment of Gillian Lynch for Binance Europe – paint a clear picture: the cryptocurrency industry is moving beyond retail speculation and firmly into the realm of sophisticated financial services. These developments signify a concerted effort to attract and serve institutional capital, which is crucial for the long-term stability and growth of the digital asset ecosystem. As the market continues to mature, we can expect more such initiatives that blend innovation with regulatory prudence, ultimately shaping a more robust and accessible financial future.

Investors and analysts are focusing on tokens that not only promise speculative gains but also substantial long-term utility and community-driven governance features. This trend has shifted investor attention significantly, as utility-driven tokens promise resilience against market volatility. Recent reports indicate several tokens are gaining traction. Notably, Remittix (RTX), Solaxy (SOLX), and Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) are catching investor eyes due to their innovative platforms and promising technological advances. Solaxy, in particular, aims to create a decentralized ecosystem tailored specifically to NFT creators and collectors, blending creativity with robust blockchain security. Bitcoin Bull offers dynamic leveraging solutions in a market often hungry for volatility management. Influencers like Ben Armstrong (BitBoy Crypto) have praised tokens with solid real-world use cases, underscoring that speculative fever alone rarely sustains long-term growth. According to Armstrong, coins listed on major decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and centralized platforms like Binance benefit from enhanced liquidity, security, and investor trust, making them safer bets in unpredictable markets. Why Investors are Prioritizing Utility Tokens Crypto presale participants have shifted toward utility-based projects to mitigate the risks associated with meme-driven volatility. Remittix, aiming to revolutionize global remittance systems, exemplifies this shift perfectly. By combining blockchain transparency with low transaction fees, it directly addresses a trillion-dollar market problem, boosting investor confidence through clear real-world application. Similarly, Bitcoin Bull’s innovative volatility management tools offer traders unique hedging options, gaining traction in volatile market conditions. Its strategic approach ensures investors receive both short-term profitability and long-term growth potential. However, amidst all this promising activity, another high-utility presale is quietly nearing its next explosive stage.

2025-07-04T16:50:22,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): Unveiling the July Bullish Breakout Potential","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): Unveiling the July Bullish Breakout Potential The air in the digital asset space is thick with anticipation. After a period of subdued price action and declining volatility, the crypto market is buzzing with whispers of a significant move. Specifically, astute traders on platforms like Derive.xyz are positioning themselves for a potential bullish breakout for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as July unfolds. Could this be the month that finally ignites a fresh wave of momentum? Why Are Traders Eyeing a July Breakout for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)? The primary catalyst for this heightened expectation stems from a notable decline in implied volatility (IV) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum throughout June. Implied volatility is a forward-looking measure of the market’s expectation of future price swings. When IV drops, it often signals a period of consolidation, where prices trade within a tighter range, effectively building pressure for a larger move once the equilibrium breaks. Think of it like a coiled spring – the tighter it gets compressed, the more powerful its release will be. This calm before the storm has allowed derivatives traders to strategically place their bets. Unlike spot trading, derivatives, especially options trading , allow participants to speculate on future price movements without owning the underlying asset. Their positioning provides valuable insight into collective market sentiment. Despite various global geopolitical events, such as the Middle East conflict, which caused temporary jitters, the broader sentiment among these traders suggests that any fallout will be limited, paving the way for internal market dynamics to take precedence. Is Bitcoin’s (BTC) Options Market Ready for a Decisive Move? While the overall outlook for a July surge is palpable, the nuances between Bitcoin’s (BTC) and Ethereum’s options markets are quite distinct. For Bitcoin, the options market currently presents a more balanced outlook. This doesn’t necessarily mean a lack of conviction, but rather a more even distribution of bullish and bearish bets compared to Ethereum. According to insights from The Block, Bitcoin’s options market is described as being ‘coiled for a decisive move.’ This implies that while there isn’t an overwhelming bias in one direction, the market is primed for a significant shift once a trigger emerges. Potential triggers could include: Macroeconomic Shifts: Changes in interest rate policies, inflation data, or global economic stability could provide the impetus. Institutional Flows: Continued inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs, or a fresh wave of institutional adoption, could significantly bolster demand. Technical Breakouts: A decisive break above key resistance levels on price charts could trigger a cascade of buy orders. This balanced yet ‘coiled’ nature suggests that while the direction isn’t explicitly defined by options data alone, the magnitude of the next move for Bitcoin could be substantial. What’s Fueling Ethereum’s (ETH) Strong Bullish Momentum? In stark contrast to Bitcoin’s balanced options landscape, Ethereum (ETH) is witnessing significantly stronger bullish momentum. A staggering nearly 80% of July call options for Ethereum are placed above the $3,000 mark. Call options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specified price (the strike price) by a certain date. A high concentration of call options at higher strike prices indicates strong confidence among traders that the asset will surpass those levels. This robust optimism for Ethereum is often attributed to its expanding ecosystem and tangible real-world use cases . Ethereum is not just a digital currency; it’s a foundational blockchain platform that underpins a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps). Key drivers for this optimism include: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for DeFi protocols, facilitating lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): The majority of high-value NFT collections and marketplaces are built on Ethereum, driving demand for its native token. Scalability Upgrades: Ongoing developments and successful implementations of upgrades like Dencun continue to improve Ethereum’s transaction speed and cost-efficiency, making it more attractive for developers and users. Potential Spot ETH ETFs: The recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. has opened doors for broader institutional investment, similar to Bitcoin’s trajectory, which could unleash significant capital into the ecosystem. The convergence of these factors creates a compelling narrative for Ethereum’s potential bullish breakout , making it a focal point for many in the crypto market . How Do Global Events Impact the Broader Crypto Market? While the internal dynamics of Bitcoin and Ethereum are certainly at play, it’s crucial to acknowledge the broader context of the crypto market . Global events, from geopolitical tensions to macroeconomic shifts, invariably cast a shadow, or sometimes a spotlight, on digital assets. The recent Middle East conflict, for instance, caused temporary spikes in volatility across various markets, including crypto. However, the market’s quick rebound and the anticipation of ‘limited fallout’ suggest a growing resilience. This resilience can be attributed to several factors: Market Maturation: The crypto market is no longer nascent; it has developed more robust infrastructure, liquidity, and a diverse participant base. Institutional Integration: As more traditional financial institutions engage with digital assets, their stability and risk assessment frameworks begin to influence crypto market behavior, potentially mitigating extreme reactions to external shocks. Decentralized Nature: The inherent decentralized nature of Bitcoin and Ethereum offers a perceived hedge against centralized financial system vulnerabilities, attracting capital during times of uncertainty. Understanding these external influences, alongside the specific options trading data, provides a holistic view of why July could be a pivotal month for the entire crypto market . Actionable Insights and Considerations For traders and investors navigating this potentially exciting period, here are some key takeaways: Monitor Implied Volatility: Continue to observe IV levels. A sustained low IV followed by a sharp increase often precedes significant price action. Watch Options Open Interest: Pay attention to the concentration of open interest at various strike prices for both BTC and ETH, especially for July expiries. Track Real-World Use Case Development: For Ethereum, keep an eye on developments in DeFi, NFTs, and scalability solutions, as these directly impact its fundamental value. Risk Management is Key: While the sentiment is bullish, the crypto market remains volatile. Employ proper risk management strategies, including setting stop-losses and diversifying portfolios. Stay Informed: Global macroeconomic news and regulatory updates can swiftly alter market sentiment. The current setup suggests a compelling narrative for a significant price movement in July. Whether it’s Bitcoin’s coiled energy or Ethereum’s clear bullish momentum driven by its robust ecosystem, the stage is set for an intriguing period in the digital asset space. In conclusion, the confluence of declining implied volatility and strategic positioning by derivatives traders points towards a highly anticipated July for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Bitcoin’s path may be more nuanced, Ethereum’s strong bullish options sentiment, backed by its expanding real-world utility, paints a particularly optimistic picture. As the crypto market holds its breath, the potential for a decisive bullish breakout is undeniable, making the coming weeks critical for anyone invested in the future of digital finance.

According to three sources familiar with the matter, the Washington administration has threatened Brussels with a 17% tariff on EU agricultural exports. This development has further increased tensions in the ongoing trade negotiations between the two sides. The latest warning from the US comes just before it launched a plan to impose 20% tariffs on all EU goods if the parties fail to reach a trade deal by July 9.

European Commission Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič received the warning himself during talks in Washington on Thursday, and the message was conveyed to the ambassadors of the 27 EU member states the next day. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on the same day that she hoped for an “agreement in principle” that would allow the parties to continue negotiations.

2025-07-04T16:39:08,"Mercado Bitcoin taps XRP Ledger for $200m RWA tokenization play","As Ripple and Boston Consulting Group forecast a $19 trillion tokenized asset market by 2033, Mercado Bitcoin is staking its claim early, with plans to deploy $200 million in regulated instruments on XRPL. In a press release on July 4, Ripple announced that Mercado Bitcoin, Latin America’s crypto giant, will tokenize over $200 million in permissioned real-world assets (RWAs), including fixed income and equity instruments, on the XRP Ledger. The move is part of Mercado Bitcoin’s broader push to expand beyond Brazil, using tokenized financial instruments as a bridge into international markets. According to Ripple, it represents one of the most significant institutional deployments of regulated assets on XRPL to date, positioning Mercado Bitcoin at the forefront of blockchain’s collision with traditional finance. You might also like: Ondo Finance to acquire SEC-regulated broker-dealer Oasis Pro Mercado Bitcoin’s institutional-grade tokenization play Mercado Bitcoin’s decision to tokenize $200 million in permissioned fixed income and equity products on the XRP Ledger is a calculated effort to position the exchange as a gateway between local financial markets and global capital networks. By leveraging XRPL’s infrastructure, Mercado Bitcoin is bypassing the walled gardens of traditional finance, opting instead to issue real-world assets directly on a public blockchain built with institutional use in mind. XRPL’s design for financial settlement, with near-instant finality and negligible fees, makes it a natural fit for regulated assets. But more importantly, its decade-long operational history, processing over 3.3 billion transactions without a single breach, gives institutional players the confidence to move real-world value onchain. Silvio Pegado, Ripple’s Managing Director for LATAM, put it succinctly: “Mercado Bitcoin’s integration with the XRPL shows how public blockchain infrastructure is being trusted by institutions and is becoming a reliable foundation for bringing regulated financial products to the market,” Pegado said. That trust isn’t theoretical. According to the press release, over 70 central banks, regulators, and financial institutions already interact with networks connected to MB’s ecosystem, signaling a quiet but seismic institutional pivot toward blockchain-based finance. The numbers back the momentum. A 2025 Ripple and Boston Consulting Group report projects the tokenized asset market will surge from $0.6 trillion today to $19 trillion by 2033, a potential 30x increase in less than a decade, with Mercado Bitcoin likely leading the charge alongside TradFi giants pivoting to RWAs. The platform has already tokenized over R$1 billion in private credit assets with zero defaults, earning its place among the world’s top five RWA tokenizers. Its ongoing work with Ripple, including cross-border treasury flows between Brazil and Portugal and the listing of the RLUSD stablecoin, demonstrates a deliberate shift toward blockchain-powered financial infrastructure.

2025-07-04T16:33:24,"Bitmine Rockets 3,000%: Crypto Mining Stocks Lead 2025 Surge","In a stunning week for crypto equities, Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) stole the headlines with a jaw-dropping 3,000% spike following news of a $250 million private placement to build an Ethereum (ETH) treasury. Bitmine official Twitter update on Q1 2025 revenue and mining capacity expansion: ”$BMNR reports a 135% revenue increase YOY for Q1 2025 and tripled self-mining capacity with 3,000 new miners!” This bold move from Bitcoin mining to an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy at the hands of Fundstrat's Tom Lee as new chairman has been drawing investors' eyes and sending Bitmine's stock from around $4.50 to over $135 in days. The surge is one of a broader crypto mining stocks rally throughout 2025, which as a group have outperformed Bitcoin and traditional assets. Crypto stocks have surged 119% year to date, with miners like Riot Platforms, Hive Digital, Hut 8, MARA Holdings, and Bitfarms posting double-digit returns of 13% to 28% in recent sessions, as per recent news. The rally has been driven by encouraging macroeconomic trends, such as the improved-than-expected U.S. job growth, which has supported risk-on mood in the equity markets. Ethereum Treasury Strategy: The Catalyst Behind Bitmine's Meteoric Rise Bitmine's devotion of its treasury nearly wholly to Ethereum is a strategic decision in accordance with growing institutional demand for ETH as a hold asset for reserve purposes. Its $250 million fundraise assembled crypto heavyweight investors in the guise of Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, and Kraken. Bitmine is attempting to mimic MicroStrategy's Bitcoin treasury strategy but in Ethereum, claiming proxy status for public exposure to ETH. This move is part of a broader trend of companies placing Ethereum in their treasury strategies, driven by the rise in stablecoins, tokenization, and fresh DeFi use cases. Institutional ETH holding reached all-time highs, with wallets holding over 22 million ETH through June 2025, up 36% in one month. Mining Stocks vs. Bitcoin While Bitcoin mining stocks historically have tracked Bitcoin price action, 2025 has seen them beating Bitcoin itself, anticipating adoption and profitability optimism in digital assets. The VanEck Digital Transformation ETF, which tracks cryptocurrency-related companies including miners, has gained more than 20% year-to-date. Bitcoin's hashprice — the revenue miners earn per unit of computational capacity — also increased recently, rising nearly 10% to approximately $58 per PH/s/day, which indicates better mining economics with rising Bitcoin prices and network changes. The improvement adds validity to valuations of mining shares but also highlights the industry's underlying volatility. What Investors Should Watch While the euphoria grips, analysts are warning against caution. Bitmine's rally is a reminder of Sharplink Gaming's earlier spike and subsequent fall, whose shares also fell precipitously after insiders sold out. The speculative nature of crypto equities and the price volatility mean that investors must scrutinize fundamentals and market conditions before riding gains. This crypto mining stock rally, led by Bitmine's historic 3,000% jump, signals an active transformation in the manner in which mining companies and investors are queueing up for the emerging crypto market in 2025. While there may be vast upside potential, the whiplash volatility and speculation risks call for guardedly strategic approach as the sector keeps unfolding.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9810/bitmine-rockets-3-000-crypto-mining-stocks-lead-2025-surge,"MINING|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Elvira Nabiullina stated that due to the volatility and risks of cryptocurrencies, she does not consider including them in the reserve and keeping them. “When we consider our attitude towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as risky and volatile assets, we, as a central bank, absolutely do not consider investing in them. Because cryptocurrencies are quite volatile and risky. We continue to oppose the use of cryptocurrencies in payments within the country. We say 'yes' for foreign economic activity, and 'yes' for qualified investors, especially as an investment target. In other words, we are not against their use in foreign economic activities, especially those that are considered investment vehicles.
