2025-07-04T07:58:55,"$1B in Bitcoin moves from Satoshi-era wallet after 14 years of inactivity","More than $1 billion in BTC was moved from a long-dormant “Satoshi era” wallet, reactivated just as Bitcoin edges toward a new all-time high. According to blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain, the wallet moved 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.09 billion, to a new address after lying untouched for 14.3 years. On-chain records indicate that the BTC was originally acquired on April 3, 2011, for just $109,246, translating to an average acquisition price of $0.78 per coin. As such, the whale is looking at returns of over 140,000x on the initial investment. While the exact motivations behind the massive transfer remain unclear, it comes at a time when Bitcoin ( BTC ) appears poised to reach a new all-time high, with analysts anticipating the milestone could be hit by the end of this week. Currently priced at $109,100, the leading cryptocurrency is just less than 3% away from surpassing its previous high. Such movements often precede selling activity, as large investors tend to accumulate at lows and realise gains near highs. It’s possible that the whale may be moving funds from a cold wallet to an exchange or a hot wallet.

On-chain analytics from Sentora reveal that whales holding over 1,000 BTC have gradually reduced their balances in recent weeks. While such distribution could exert short-term selling pressure, Sentora analysts argue this trend may represent a positive structural shift. “Rather than signaling weakness, this redistribution reflects a maturing market,” stated Sentora. “Older ‘whale’ coins are dispersing, a dynamic that should ultimately strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.” However, data from Glassnode offers a more nuanced counterpoint. The platform’s “Liveliness” metric, which measures the degree to which BTC holders are spending versus holding, has continued to trend downward. Source: Glassnode Unlike previous cycles where profit-taking surged as prices reached new highs, current behavior suggests long-term investors are maintaining their positions, even near peak valuations. Supporting this trend, the total BTC held by long-term holders , defined as those who have held for over 155 days, has reached a record high of 14.7 million coins. Notably, most BTC that were acquired near the $100,000 breakout threshold remain unmoved, reflecting growing conviction and reduced speculative pressure among investors. Institutions ramp up their BTC buying While long-term whale holders could be positioning their holdings for a sell-off, institutional investors have been steadily increasing their exposure to Bitcoin. Over the past week, multiple companies have announced ambitious plans to establish or expand Bitcoin treasuries. These include Fragbite Group , whose stock surged 64% after revealing its intention to allocate part of its balance sheet to BTC, and Vanadi Coffee , which gained over 240% in a month following shareholder approval to invest up to $1.1 billion in Bitcoin. Other firms that are jumping in include Belgravia Hartford , which disclosed it had secured $1 million in funding to grow its BTC treasury, while Norway-based Green Minerals announced a plan to raise $1.2 billion for the same purpose. The uptick in corporate interest shows growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, especially as it edges closer to price discovery territory. It comes as a growing number of analysts project even higher targets for BTC in the months ahead. According to crypto trader CryptoFayz, if Bitcoin breaks its current all-time high of $111,960, a continuation to $116,000 is likely, citing technical chart structures. Meanwhile, long-term projections remain even more bullish. Standard Chartered and Bernstein both forecast Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, while BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has set an even higher year-end target of $250,000.

At this point, companies prefer cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and XRP for their treasury reserves. Amber Group, the crypto company that announced its $100 million reserve plan, announced that it has raised $25.5 million through a private placement to expand its Crypto Ecosystem Reserve strategy, The Block reported. The fund, raised by Amber Group subsidiary Amber International, was joined by major institutional investors including Pantera Capital, CMAG Fund and Kingkey Financial International. Amber International issued more than 12 million shares of Class A common stock on Nasdaq to raise capital. Since establishing the crypto reserve last May, Amber International has invested in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). With this capital expansion, the company plans to expand its portfolio to include Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), and Sui (SUI). “With this strategy, we aim to meet institutional demand for tokenized real-world assets (RWA) and pioneer blockchain-based financial innovation,” a spokesperson from Amber International said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T07:57:47,"Bitmine rallied to over $135 after announcing ETH treasury","Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. has reached a four-year price peak, doubling its price in the past two days. The company has unlocked a 3,000% rally after announcing its $250M facility to build an ETH treasury. Bitmine was one of the latest treasury companies to unlock a stock rally. In the past two days alone, Bitmine rallied by more than 100%, reaching a price of $135 for the first time since April 2021. The latest stock rally launched after Bitmine announced a $250M private placement with the goal of acquiring and holding ETH. The price jumped additionally after the closing of the private placement on July 3. Bitmine rallied in the past day, following the closing of a $250M private placement deal with the goal of building an ETH treasury. | Source: Google Finance Bitmine started out from all-time lows, rising from a $1 mining stock to over $135 in the span of a week. Bitmine continues to rally as the leader to the pack of Ethereum treasury stocks , which joined the Bitcoin trend in the past few weeks. The growth trend also boosted the shares of Sharplink Gaming, rising further from $9.50 to over $12.60. SBET share prices are still down from their peak, but the recent recovery shows enthusiasm for ETH treasuries remains high. BitDigital, Inc. also rose to a one-month high of $2.94. ETH treasuries also allow companies to stake the tokens for additional passive income. Sharplink Gaming has already staked 95% of its ETH valued at over $450M. Bitmine plans dual BTC-ETH strategy Bitmine already holds 154.2 BTC, acquired at prices above $106,000 since June 16. The company has also hidden hashrate that would produce additional BTC inflows in the coming six months. Bitmine aims to use its private placement proceeds, along with BTC, to acquire more ETH and build its treasury. The company aims to acquire crypto for long-term holding, from a mix of BTC mining operations or from raising additional capital. Bitmine has direct mining operations, contracts in synthetic market, and hashrate as a financial product. Bitmine also works as a mining consultant, while also owning data centers in low-cost locations in Texas. Can Bitmine reawaken ETH? Demand for ETH has risen, based on ETF buying. The recent announcement of corporate treasuries is still not making a dent on the market. ETH remains a speculatively traded asset, with deliberate trading against long positions, leading to a depressed market price trading within a range around $2,500. ETH traded at $2,557.21, far from the exuberance of treasury company shares. The token stalled just under $2,700, falling on selling pressure. For bullish traders, ETH was supposed to make a hike to $3,000, though for now the rallies are cut short. Ethereum has seen increased staking and on-chain activity, with growing demand for DeFi. The network is slowly regaining its activity, mostly based on stablecoin usage. USDT and USDC drive traffic on Ethereum, as part of both centralized and decentralized activity. The recent treasuries are still not buying at the scale of Strategy, which is already affecting the BTC market. However, the appearance of a new wave of altcoin treasury companies may extend the 2025 crypto rally. Companies have already announced SOL and BNB treasuries, but ETH may be a prime candidate for reserves with guaranteed staking rewards.

The legislation, which promises deep tax cuts and sweeping spending reforms, is set to be signed into law on July 4 in a high-profile Independence Day ceremony. Republican Pushback Falls Short Despite Republican leadership rallying support, the bill faced opposition from within Trump’s party. GOP lawmakers Thomas Massie and Brian Fitzpatrick voted against it in the House, joining Senate Republicans Rand Paul, Susan Collins, and Thom Tillis, who opposed the bill earlier. Their concerns revolved around steep cuts to Medicaid, expanded tax breaks for the wealthy, and fears that the package could explode the national deficit. Yet, House Republicans managed to hold the line, persuading holdout Ralph Norman to flip his stance. With Vice President J.D. Vance previously casting the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, the path was cleared for the bill’s final approval. Economists Raised a Red Flag Economic analysts are sounding alarms. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the bill could add a massive $5.5 trillion to the national debt if the provisions become permanent. The U.S. debt, currently near 100% of GDP, could soar to 127% by 2034. Moody’s has also warned of growing investor unease and bond market volatility triggered by the legislation’s long-term fiscal risks. American Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unleashed a scathing attack on #DonaldTrump 's Big Beautiful Bill, warning it would strip coverage from 17 million Americans while raising taxes on those earning less than $50, 000. #BBB pic.twitter.com/U8YTkrkGzu — Good Point (@the_Good_Point) July 4, 2025 Whereas, the democrats, led by former President Joe Biden, labeled the bill “reckless and cruel,” warning it could strip healthcare from millions of Americans due to the proposed Medicaid cuts. Biden emphasized the bill favors the rich while threatening the social safety net. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, a one-time Trump ally, has voiced strong disapproval, signaling plans to campaign against lawmakers who backed it. What Comes Next? With the bill’s signing imminent, attention now turns to its implementation and its political fallout. As Trump pushes forward with his economic vision, critics are preparing for a fierce battle over the nation’s fiscal future, and voters will likely have the final say in 2026.

2025-07-04T07:46:21,"A Dormant Bitcoin Address Containing 10,000 BTC Becomes Active After 14.3 Years","In a rare and intriguing event, a dormant Bitcoin address holding 10,000 BTC—currently valued at over $1.09 billion has suddenly come back to life after 14.3 years of complete inactivity. According to Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service that flagged the movement, the address last saw activity in 2011 when the balance was worth just $7,793. From Forgotten to Billion-Dollar Wallet The reactivation of such an old wallet is an extraordinary occurrence. The address likely dates back to the earliest era of Bitcoin, when the cryptocurrency was trading below $1 and mining was accessible to anyone with a basic computer. Over a decade later, this same stash now commands a fortune, illustrating the remarkable trajectory of Bitcoin’s rise. The transaction did not simply signal wallet access. The 10,000 BTC was moved out of the address in an outgoing transaction, confirming that the holder either recovered access to the wallet or had been deliberately holding it this entire time. On-chain data reveals that the coins weren’t transferred to an exchange, but rather redistributed to multiple new addresses, a common practice used to enhance privacy and obscure transaction trails. A dormant address containing 10,000 #BTC (1,092,973,486 USD) has just been activated after 14.3 years (worth 7,793 USD in 2011)! https://t.co/hzeryv3B5t — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 4, 2025 Speculation and Theories Erupt The crypto community reacted swiftly to the news, with many taking to X to share theories, concerns, and jokes. Calvin Weight questioned whether movements like this are why Bitcoin doesn’t rise despite major institutional purchases, posting: “Is this why BTC doesn’t go up in price when companies are buying billions of dollars?” Pablo Heman, known as Plan A, reignited the ever-present mystery of Bitcoin’s origins, asking: “What if this is Satoshi dumping?”—a theory that gains traction every time ancient coins begin to move. Others speculated the wallet owner may have only recently found the long-lost seed phrase. Chris commented, “They finally found the seed phrase, or we are all in trouble.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adding a touch of humor, user @Clearingkarma wrote: “Ross turned into a billionaire. Much wow!”—a tongue-in-cheek reference to Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road fame, though no evidence connects him to the address. Market Reaction and Broader Implications Surprisingly, the activation had little to no immediate impact on Bitcoin’s market price . This suggests that the BTC wasn’t sold, and reflects the market’s growing maturity. Historically, when old coins are moved, it often leads to market volatility. However, with current liquidity levels, the market appears better equipped to handle such movements without significant price swings. Still, the event highlights the ongoing mystery and legacy of Bitcoin’s early adopters. Whether this was a lost key finally recovered or a long-held strategic move, the sheer scale of the fortune involved serves as a stark reminder of the wealth still locked away in the blockchain’s early blocks. For now, the identity of the wallet owner remains unknown, but the crypto world is once again reminded that Bitcoin never forgets.

According to a July 4 analysis published on CryptoQuant by contributor Axel Adler, Chainlink ( LINK ) wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million LINK, often categorized as whale addresses, have now accumulated more than 85 million tokens. Since late 2022, this is the highest amount of whale-held supply. In contrast, retail holders have remained largely inactive, creating what Adler calls a “standoff” between deep-pocketed investors and smaller participants. This quiet accumulation phase has not yet translated into significant price movement. At press time, LINK is trading at $13.48, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours and about 7% lower over the past month. Over the last seven days, it has moved within a tight range between $12.76 and $13.96.

The relative strength index is near 50, indicating neutral momentum, and the MACD is slightly bullish. LINK is displaying some short-term strength, currently trading slightly above both its 10-day and 20-day moving averages. However, it remains below longer-term averages such as the 100-day and 200-day, indicating that the market is still hesitant . LINK may move toward $15 if it breaks above $14.10 with strong volume. On the other hand, it might fall towards he $12.50 level if it falls below $13.00. For now, the market appears to be waiting to see if retail traders or whales will determine the next move.

This new financial product could reshape Japan’s fixed-income market. With interest rates in Japan staying historically low, MetaPlanet plans to offer yen-denominated securities with high annual yields of 9 to 10 percent, using Bitcoin as collateral. The Problem in Japan’s Financial Market Crypto expert Adam Livingston explains that Japanese households hold over 2,200 trillion yen in financial assets. A large portion of this money is sitting in cash or deposits that earn less than 0.23 percent interest. Meanwhile, Japan’s annual inflation rate stands around 3.5 percent. In October 2024, it was 2.3 percent. It peaked at 4 percent in January 2025 and then stayed between 3.6 and 3.7 percent in the following months. This means most savings are losing value in real terms. The yield on Japan’s 10-year government bond is currently at 1.45 percent. In March, it was slightly higher at 1.63 percent. Japanese life insurers, who manage about 390 trillion yen, are now seeking better returns to meet long-term obligations. Livingston also notes that regulators in Japan are encouraging the development of new financial products that offer higher returns without adding foreign currency risks. MetaPlanet’s Solution: Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Stock MetaPlanet aims to address this issue by launching a preferred stock backed by Bitcoin. The stock will be issued in Japanese yen and offer high yields of 9 to 10 percent annually. Bitcoin is known for its long-term price appreciation and is often seen as a hedge against inflation. This makes it an attractive asset to back fixed-income securities. [post_titles_links postid=”478498″] Strategic Growth and Bitcoin Accumulation MetaPlanet is already a major Bitcoin holder, with at least 13,350 BTC, valued at over $ 1.45 billion. Livingston says the company can use funds raised through these preferred stocks to buy more Bitcoin. As their Bitcoin holdings grow, the value of the collateral increases. This could allow MetaPlanet to reduce coupon rates in future offerings and lower its capital costs. The company’s long-term goal is to accumulate 210,000 BTC , which would comprise approximately 1% of the total Bitcoin supply . A Major Shift in Japan’s Financial System Livingston believes this new offering is not just another product. It represents a major shift in Japan’s financial system. A yen-denominated, Bitcoin-backed investment could provide better yields for savers, modernize capital markets, and avoid the risks of foreign currency exposure. This move could set a new standard for fixed income investments in Japan.

MetaPlanet is addressing Japan’s financial market issues, where over 2,200 trillion yen in savings earn less than 0.23% interest while inflation runs around 3.5%. This new product offers significantly higher returns (9-10%) and is encouraged by regulators seeking new, higher-yielding, non-foreign currency risk financial products.

Here's Everything You Need to Know…","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin has made an attack in recent days, rising from the level of $ 105,000 to the level of $ 109,000. While it remains uncertain whether this rise will continue, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. According to the first weekly data for July, $3 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $612 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on July 4 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 1.05, the maximum loss point is $ 106,000 and the notional value is $ 3 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 1.24, a maximum loss point of $2,500, and a notional value of $612 million. The maximum pain point is the level at which the price of a cryptocurrency settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin prices as the $3 billion options expiration on July 4th. While the maximum pain point is at $106,000 for BTC and $2,500 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. What Does the Put/Call Ratio Signal for Bitcoin and Ethereum? The put/call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of put options by the number of call options. A ratio below 1 means there are more buys than puts, indicating an uptrend. A ratio above 1 means there are more puts than calls, indicating a downtrend. A ratio close to 1 means the market is balanced or neutral. For Bitcoin, this ratio is 1.05, while for Ethereum it is 1.24. For BTC, this ratio is 1 and indicates a balanced, sideways market, while for Ethereum, this ratio is above 1 and indicates a downward trend. However, time will tell how these rates will affect the price. At this point, do not make your investment decisions based on a single data or report. *This is not investment advice.

Krüger tells his 211,500 followers on the social media platform X that the “upcoming Bitcoin breakout will be explosive.” According to the economist and trader, one of the catalysts that will drive the Bitcoin rally he foresees will be the legislation currently waiting to be passed in the U.S. Congress known as the One Big Beautiful Act (OBBA). The omnibus legislation addresses some of President Trump’s election campaign promises. The economist and trader says the accumulation of Bitcoin by companies intending to include the flagship crypto asset in their balance sheets is another catalyst that will “add fuel to the fire.” Additionally, the economist and trader says the Federal Reserve Chair set to be appointed in 2026 to replace the current Chair Jerome Powell will be the “icing on the cake.” According to Krüger, Powell’s replacement will be a bullish catalyst over the short term. The economist and trader further says Bitcoin’s current price action is operating in a similar environment to five years ago. “When it comes to analogies across cycles and Bitcoin Treasury companies, June 2025 is analogous to December 2020 and the Bitcoin Grayscale trade.” In December of 2020, Bitcoin broke above the then all-time high of around $20,000 that had been in place for three years. The rally occurred at a time when the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) was trading at a significant premium to the net asset value of the underlying Bitcoin amid robust institutional demand. Bitcoin is trading at $110,210 at time of writing.

2025-07-04T07:03:13,"Solo Bitcoin Miner Strikes Gold, Nets Nearly $350,000 from Single Block","A solo Bitcoin miner has defied extraordinary odds, successfully mining an entire block and earning just under $350,000 in Bitcoin rewards. Key Takeaways: A solo miner beat 1-in-2,800 daily odds to mine a Bitcoin block and earned nearly $350,000. The miner’s modest 2.3 PH/s setup shows small operators can still strike it big despite low odds. Industrial miners scaled back output in June, highlighting contrasting fortunes with solo successes. The miner, working through the CKpool solo mining pool, used a rig producing 2.3 petahashes per second (PH/s) to solve block 903883, according to mining data from Mempool Space . Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo pointed out the rarity of the event , calling it a remarkable feat. Solo Miner Faces 1-in-2,800 Daily Odds to Solve a Bitcoin Block The CKpool administrator explained that a miner operating at 2.3 PH/s has only about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block on any given day, or roughly one success every eight years on average. At current network difficulty, that’s just a 0.004% chance per day. The solo miner’s block yield included a reward of 3.173 BTC, valued at approximately $349,028 at the time. While the miner’s exact hardware setup remains unclear, experts believe it likely involved several older-generation ASIC rigs combined to reach the modest hashrate of 2.3 PH/s. By contrast, smaller hobbyist machines like Bitaxe or USB-based NerdMiner units produce only terahashes or kilohashes per second, making their chances of hitting a full block effectively negligible. BREAKING: A SOLO MINER JUST MINED AN ENTIRE #BITCOIN BLOCK WORTH OVER $350,000 THEY BEAT INCREDIBLE ODDS pic.twitter.com/Cp5xV7ZlKR — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) July 3, 2025 For solo miners aiming to mine a block every month, an estimated 166,000 terahashes per second, equivalent to about 500 Antminer S21 Hydro machines, would be required, a setup costing millions of dollars. Yet the latest lucky miner’s success proves that, in solo mining, probability can sometimes favor even modest operators. The win follows similar solo miner victories earlier this year. In February, a solo miner hit block 883,181 for over $300,000 in rewards, and another solo miner mined block 899,826 in early June, earning roughly $330,000. Meanwhile, major industrial Bitcoin mining firms such as Riot Platforms, Cipher Mining, and MARA Holdings reported lower output in June. The companies scaled back operations in Texas to sidestep peak demand charges during the state’s expensive summer electricity periods. Chinese Roots Still Dominate Global Bitcoin Mining As reported, over half of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations still trace their origins to China , with 55% to 65% of mining linked to Chinese capital, hardware, or expertise, according to Uminers CEO Batyr Hydyrov. Despite China’s 2021 mining ban, key Chinese players have maintained influence by relocating operations overseas. Major Chinese manufacturers Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, responsible for 99% of Bitcoin mining hardware, have shifted production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, helping boost America’s share of Bitcoin’s total hashrate from 4% in 2019 to 38% today. Hydyrov added that former Chinese miners have often increased capacity after moving abroad, with some expanding by up to 150%, and noted that limited mining still persists within China’s remote regions where enforcement is lax.

2025-07-04T07:00:00,"Bitcoin Latest Rally Backed By Stronger Purchasing Power: Report","Data of the Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio suggests investors have stronger purchasing power today than during the previous bull rally. Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio Showing Neutral Purchasing Power In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) of Bitcoin. This indicator measures the ratio between the Bitcoin supply and the supply of stablecoins. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bounces Back With 8% Gain—Is $0.26 In Sight? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that have their price tied to a fiat currency. The SSR specifically measures the supply of the stablecoins tied to the US Dollar (USD). As for the role that these assets play in the sector, Glassnode explains: Stablecoins have become a critical component of the digital asset ecosystem, serving as the primary quote asset for trading across both centralized and decentralized venues. Functionally, they represent readily available capital, or “dry powder”, available for digital asset purchases. As such, the SSR compares the Bitcoin supply against this available dry powder. In other words, it tells us about how the cryptocurrency compares against the investor’s purchasing power. When the value of the metric is high, it means the BTC supply is high compared to the stablecoin supply. In other words, the trader’s purchasing power is weak. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests there is high dry powder available relative to the BTC supply. In the context of the current discussion, the SSR itself isn’t of focus, but rather a modified indicator called the SSR Oscillator. According to the analytics firm, the metric measures “how the 200d SMA of the SSR moves within the Bollinger Bands BB(200, 2).” Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SSR Oscillator over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin SSR Oscillator has been close to the zero mark during the last couple of months, indicating the investor purchasing power is more or less neutral compared to the size of the BTC supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Upper Bound Is $117,000, Glassnode Says From the chart, it’s visible that the trend was different during the rally beyond $100,000 that occurred late last year. Back then, the SSR Oscillator took on a highly positive value, suggesting the stablecoin supply was low relative to BTC. The cryptocurrency is currently also trading around the same levels as then, yet the SSR is showing a different story. “Despite similar price levels, this shift suggests that investor purchasing power has improved markedly, reflecting stronger underlying demand conditions,” notes the report. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $109,500, up over 2% in the last seven days.

2025-07-04T06:44:24,"Crypto ETF BLOX, Which Offers Digital Asset Exposure and Options Income, Gains Steam","A recently launched crypto ETF in the U.S., which offers diversified exposure to digital assets along with options income, is gaining traction in a sign that investors are looking beyond traditional, single-spot-focused products. The Nicholas Crypto Income ETF (BLOX), an actively managed ETF designed for diversified exposure to the digital assets ecosystem while generating additional income via options strategies, went live on the NYSE on June 17. The ETF is the latest addition to the XFUNDS by Nicholas Wealth suite. Since then, the ETF has registered a net inflow of around $4.52 million, according to data source VettaFi. BLOX's website puts the total net assets at $4.9 million. ""The options income space is almost becoming its own asset class,"" David Nicholas, CEO of XFUNDs, told CoinDesk in an interview, adding that the fund is drawing interest from yield-hungry retail investors. Three-sleeved product The fund, launched in partnership with Tidal Investments LLC, comprises of an equity sleeve that invests in publicly listed shares of crypto-related firms and companies holding digital assets on their balance sheets. The second sleeve of the fund offers exposure to select bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds, with the flexibility to expand exposure to other digital assets through potential regulated vehicles. As of Thursday, the fund's top 10 holdings included names such as BlackRock's spot Ethereum ETF, Coinbase, Nvidia, MARA, Core Scientific, and others. The unique mix of holdings ensures that the performance isn't entirely dependent on bitcoin's (BTC) price. ""We own about 11 businesses, and we have high conviction that they will benefit from Bitcoin or Ether appreciation, but they aren't crypto assets themselves. So, you gain exposure to both cryptocurrency and publicly traded companies with earnings and growth. We think that combination inside the fund is pretty unique,"" Nicholas said. Finally, there is an options sleeve that generates income. The fund writes call/put spreads on the crypto sleeve while selectively writing covered calls or put spreads on its equity holdings. Writing an option is akin to selling insurance against bullish or bearish price moves in return for an upfront premium, which represents the income of the writer (seller). Writing put spreads against holdings allows the fund to collect premiums as the assets appreciate, providing additional income alongside the gains from the underlying holdings. BLOX trades options tied to the spot ETFs, including those linked to BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, IBIT. For instance, shares in Coinbase, one of the ETF's top 10 holdings, rose over 14% in the last week of June. The fund's three-sleeved structure means it likely captured the full rally alongside income through put spreads. The same can be said with respect to Core Scientific, which recently rose 15%. ""That’s what’s great about put spreads—there’s no cap. A put spread is a long, bullish options position,"" Nicholas said. The income from options and dividends on stock holdings is distributed to subscribers every week. Note that crypto holders have been writing put spreads and higher-strike calls on the offshore derivatives giant Deribit for some time. These yield-generation strategies are quite popular in the equity markets. Open to altcoin inclusion When asked about the growing interest in ETFs tied to major altcoins such as Solana's SOL (SOL), XRP (XRP) and others, Nicholas said they will accommodate the new ones as and when they become available. ""Once the SEC approves others—like Solana, which has a pending ETF—we can file an amendment and add them to our fund. So we wouldn’t need a new ETF. Since we see this as a broad crypto exposure fund, we’d just edit the existing structure to include new assets,"" Nicholas told CoinDesk.

The U.S. is entering a big week for crypto as President Trump’s major bill is set to be signed on July 4, and lawmakers will launch “ Crypto Week ” from July 14–18. During this time, three major bills, the CLARITY Act, Anti-CBDC Act, and GENIUS Act, will be discussed. These could bring clear rules, block government-backed digital surveillance, and support crypto innovation. If passed, they might kickstart the next bull run.

Trump’s bullish moves have given new hope within the crypto community. Crypto eyes are locked on these 3 major crypto bills this week that could decide whether the momentum continues or fizzles out. GENIUS Act to Lead the Way Leading the agenda is the GENIUS Act , a bill that recently cleared the Senate and is poised to pass in the House. This legislation focuses on bringing stablecoins into the traditional financial system. While it has drawn criticism for favoring fiat structures over DeFi ideals, it has also prompted companies like Tether to ramp up investments in Treasury bonds. The bill is widely viewed as a cornerstone of Trump’s vision to boost the dollar’s dominance through stablecoins. The CLARITY Act will Open Doors for Transparency in the System The CLARITY Act is also gaining traction, aiming to end the long-standing confusion over whether crypto assets should be treated as securities or commodities. While the bill remains under committee review, “Crypto Week” is expected to amplify support for its consumer protection and token classification framework. However, it has faced some pushback, with former CFTC Chair Tom Massad expressing concerns about the bill’s flexible language and regulatory ambiguity. [post_titles_links postid=”478131″] Anti-CBDC Act: Less Urgent, But Politically Symbolic Rounding out the trio is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Though it hasn’t seen movement in recent months, Republicans are still backing it strongly as a preventative measure against a government-issued central bank digital currency. The bill would essentially block the Fed from issuing a CBDC, aligning with Trump’s clear anti-CBDC stance. However, the proposal doesn’t affect citizens using foreign CBDCs, making its practical impact limited for now. Congressional Crypto Push Gets Real With Republicans pushing forward on these bills, “Crypto Week” marks a historic moment for US crypto legislation. While the GENIUS Act seems set to pass, the other two bills may gain momentum from the increased attention. The week may also reveal how deep the divide is between pro-crypto innovation and concerns about regulation and control.

According to data from Deribit, the leading crypto options exchange, these contracts are set to expire at 08:00 UTC, with the “max pain” price currently pegged at $106,000. This price level reflects the point where most options, both calls and puts, expire with little to no value, often resulting in the least payout to traders and the highest benefit to sellers. When expiry nears, price action sometimes moves toward this level, especially when it’s within reach. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at $109,044 as of press time, up 0.2% from the previous day. The market momentum may be slowing, as shown by a 21% drop in trading volume to $28.9 billion over the past day. Lower volume around an expiry event can increase sensitivity to sudden price moves as traders adjust their positions. You might also like: Bitcoin price outlook: Long-term $120k trendline test could define Q3 The put-to-call ratio for this expiry is 1.05, indicating a fairly balanced scenario between bullish and bearish bets. Although it doesn’t point strongly in either direction, this even split and Bitcoin staying above the maximum pain level suggest some downside risk as contracts settle and traders unwind. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin continues to hold within an upward trend. It’s still above its 20-day and 10-day moving averages, which act as short-term dynamic support. BTC is also trading near the top of its Bollinger Bands, often a sign of buying strength, but also an area where rallies can lose steam if new buyers don’t step in. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The MACD is in positive territory, indicating some underlying strength, even though momentum indicators are beginning to show signs of exhaustion. If Bitcoin drops below $107,500, it might move toward the $106,000 mark, a critical support zone that aligns with the maximum pain target and recent technical lows. However, if the price stays above $108,000 and breaks through $110,000 on increasing volume, it might indicate renewed bullish momentum and pave the way for another retest of the all-time high above $111,000.

The latest US jobs data came in stronger than expected, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to hold off on interest rate cuts. But according to analyst Ran, inflation numbers could still open the door for a rate cut this month, a move that might trigger a big Bitcoin rally.

2025-07-04T06:28:06,"Following the Major Tax Law in the US, a Major Cryptocurrency Tax Bill Has Now Been Proposed","Describing current practices for taxing digital assets as “outdated,” Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis today introduced a new bill that aims to modernize cryptocurrency taxation. With this move, Lummis has brought the crypto-friendly regulations he has been advocating for a long time back to the Congressional agenda. The Republican senator’s new bill is almost identical to provisions President Donald Trump tried to include in his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” reconciliation package earlier in the week, but those provisions were not included in the package and were not put to a vote during the vote. Related News: Pantera Capital and Unexpected Altcoin Announce New Joint Investment of $250 Million “We cannot allow outdated tax policies to stifle American innovation,” Lummis said in a statement. “This bill ensures that our citizens can participate in the digital economy without accidentally committing tax violations.” He also invited public comments on the bill, saying he aims to “get it to the President’s desk.” The highlights of the new bill include ending double taxation of mining and staking activities and exempting digital asset transactions of up to $300 from tax. This threshold aims to eliminate the need for users to keep tax records at every step for small transactions, such as buying coffee with Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T06:23:51,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: $108K Trendline Support Faces Key Test After 147K NFP","Bitcoin is trading at $108,859, slightly lower on the day, despite U.S. macro data coming in stronger than expected. The June Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report showed a gain of 147,000 jobs, above the forecasted 111,000. However, markets viewed it as a mixed bag; wage growth slowed to 0.2%, unemployment ticked up to 4.1%, and ISM Services PMI barely stayed above expansion at 50.8. https://twitter.com/CEA47/status/1940761777408712763 Despite stronger factory orders at 8.2%, concerns about labour softness and Fed independence (after Trump’s Powell comments) continue to cap any significant rebound in the dollar. That’s helped Bitcoin stay afloat as an alternative asset, even if risk appetite remains tempered. With markets still pricing in at least one Fed rate cut before year-end, the environment remains broadly supportive of crypto, especially if inflation readings continue to cool. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Higher Lows Hold, but MACD Weakens The Bitcoin price prediction remains bulli sh, as BTC has been respecting an ascending trendline since the June 21 low, consistently making higher lows on the 2-hour chart. That trend remains intact for now, with support seen around $108,371, where the 50-day EMA meets the trendline —a critical technical confluence. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview But momentum is showing early signs of fatigue: The MACD histogram has turned red Signal lines are curling down, but no confirmed bearish crossover yet Recent candles near $110,413 resistance are small-bodied, showing indecision and waning buyer strength If the price holds this zone and prints a reversal candle, such as a hammer or bullish engulfing, bulls could regain control, targeting $110,400 and $112,041. However, a close below $108,300 may open the door for a sharper decline to $107,325 and $105,368, with broader trendline support near $103,748 offering the next significant cushion. Bitcoin Trade Setup: Trendline Bounce or Breakdown? This setup is classic for traders watching structural support: Buy Scenario: Look for bullish candlestick confirmation above $108,300 Target Levels: $110,400 and $112,041 Bearish Breakdown: Close below $108,300 could push toward $107,300 and $105,000 Indicators to Watch: MACD crossover, EMA slope, volume spike From my experience, trendline support like this doesn’t give way quietly. If bulls show up here, we may see a strong rotation higher. But if they don’t, risk increases for a technical shakeout that could catch over-leveraged long positions off guard.

2025-07-04T06:12:45,"Detroit sues real estate tokenization firm RealToken over 400 blighted properties","The city of Detroit has filed a sweeping lawsuit against crypto-based real estate firm RealToken LLC and its affiliates for public nuisance violations across more than 400 residential properties. RealToken LLC uses blockchain technology to tokenize real estate and sell fractional ownership to investors. However, what city officials describe as widespread neglect of housing standards has prompted Detroit to pursue legal action, alleging that the firm failed to meet basic health and safety obligations as a landlord According to the complaint filed in Wayne County Circuit Court, the defendants, named as RealToken LLC, co-founders Remy and Jean-Marc Jacobson, and 165 affiliated corporate entities, allowed hundreds of properties to deteriorate. City inspectors from the Buildings, Safety Engineering, and Environmental Department documented ongoing violations across the properties, including structural damage, rodent infestations, mold growth, sewage backups, and illegal utility connections. Of these, 53 were deemed to pose an immediate threat to tenant health and safety. City officials say RealToken used a network of limited liability companies, many registered as shell entities, to obscure true ownership and avoid accountability, leaving tenants to endure unsafe living conditions. You might also like: Ondo Finance, Pantera Capital to invest $250M in RWA tokenization Detroit is asking the court to mandate urgent repairs, establish rent escrow accounts, and hold the Jacobson brothers personally liable for allegedly refusing to fund necessary maintenance through former property management companies. RealToken launched in 2019 as a real estate tokenization platform on Ethereum and later migrated to Gnosis Chain. It allows investors to purchase shares in rental properties via cryptocurrency from any corner of the globe, with its whitepaper claiming the model lowers investment barriers and increases transparency in traditionally illiquid markets. Critics, however, argue that the fractional ownership model used by RealToken has led to vacancies because properties are often acquired as investment assets rather than maintained as active rental homes. With ownership divided among numerous investors, many of whom are not locally involved, there is little incentive or clear responsibility to ensure properties remain habitable or occupied. As a result, many homes have been left empty, deteriorating over time, and contributing to neighborhood decline. “This is the largest nuisance abatement case in our history,” said Corporation Counsel Conrad Mallett, adding that innovation does not exempt firms from fulfilling legal responsibilities. Global interest in tokenized real estate is rising, with Deloitte projecting the market to grow to $4 trillion by 2035. The tokenization model is gaining traction as blockchain platforms make real estate more accessible through fractional ownership, thereby lowering capital requirements while also improving market liquidity.

After hitting a 24-hour high of $110,117, Bitcoin now trades at $109,386, reflecting a 1.8% increase in the past day. This recent push places the asset about $2,000 surge away from its all-time high of $111,814, recorded in May 2025, prompting renewed attention from traders and analysts. While price movements often attract headlines, on-chain data has started signaling deeper market activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising Binance Sees 3,400 Bitcoin in Outflows as Spot Volume Surges According to CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, a substantial volume of BTC has recently been moved off Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. The shift aligns with anticipation around a series of US macroeconomic indicators, which historically tend to influence risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Taha highlighted that Binance recorded a net outflow of over 3,400 BTC in a single day. This occurred shortly after Bitcoin’s price breached the $109,000 mark. Large-scale withdrawals from exchanges such as Binance are often interpreted as a sign that holders may be preparing to hold their assets longer-term, or shielding their positions from potential short-term volatility. Simultaneously, Binance’s share of the global Bitcoin spot volume surged significantly, from 41% to 56% in just one session. Taha noted that this spike indicates increased reliance on Binance’s liquidity by traders seeking exposure to Bitcoin ahead of anticipated market-moving economic data. The outflow trend, paired with rising spot volume, suggests that traders are actively responding to broader market signals, especially from traditional finance. US Jobs Report Drives Market Positioning The current surge in Bitcoin activity coincides with heightened market focus on US labor market data, including the Non-Farm Employment Change, Unemployment Rate, and Average Hourly Earnings figures. These indicators are closely watched by investors as they influence inflation expectations and the Federal Reserve’s approach to interest rate adjustments. Shifts in rate expectations often have direct consequences for risk assets like Bitcoin, as changes in the cost of capital affect liquidity and investor appetite. Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Taha suggests that the recent Binance outflows may reflect investor positioning ahead of potential macro-driven market volatility. “Bitcoin outflows from Binance alongside the sharp rise in spot trading activity… appear to show that investors are positioning for potential upside volatility,” he wrote. A favorable labor report could amplify bullish sentiment across both equity and crypto markets if it strengthens expectations of a rate cut or an extended pause in rate hikes.

2025-07-04T06:00:11,"Ripple USD Gets Support From First Global Bank","Zug-based AMINA Bank, the Swiss crypto-focused lender regulated by FINMA, said on 3 July that it has begun offering custody and over-the-counter trading for Ripple USD (RLUSD), becoming what it calls “the first bank globally” to support the dollar-pegged stablecoin and giving the six-month-old token its first foothold inside the traditional banking system. AMINA Bank Backs Ripple’s RLUSD RLUSD is issued by Standard Custody, a New York-chartered limited-purpose trust company wholly owned by Ripple Labs, and is fully backed “by cash and cash equivalents” held under NYDFS supervision; the token lives natively on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, allowing settlement across public and permissioned rails. Since its mid-December 2024 debut RLUSD’s market capitalization has climbed above $440 million, while the wider stablecoin sector has swollen to roughly $263 billion—both record highs that underscore accelerating institutional demand for regulated digital cash. “AMINA will enable its client base of professional investors, institutions and corporations to access Ripple’s stablecoin ecosystem with the security and governance clients expect from a traditional banking partner,” chief product officer Myles Harrison said, praising Ripple’s “commitment to transparency and compliance.” The partnership deepens ties forged when the bank—licensed in Switzerland since 2019 and now also regulated in Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong—pivoted to act as a multi-jurisdictional bridge between conventional finance and on-chain liquidity. For Ripple, AMINA’s endorsement follows April’s integration of RLUSD into Ripple Payments, the company’s cross-border treasury platform already live in more than 70 payout corridors, where early adopters such as BKK Forex and iSend are settling flows with the token. The announcement lands as the European Union’s MiCA regime , whose transaction-volume caps for non-e-money stablecoins took effect on 30 June 2024, forces issuers to demonstrate reserve integrity and governance discipline to maintain access to the bloc. Separately, Ripple confirmed on 2 July that it has applied for a national bank charter with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and—through its Standard Custody & Trust subsidiary—for a Federal Reserve master account, a step chief executive Brad Garlinghouse said would provide “both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market” while letting the firm hold RLUSD reserves “directly with the Fed” to “future-proof trust” in the token.

2025-07-04T05:50:27,"Tether USDT: Massive 1 Billion Minting Sparks Crucial Market Shift","BitcoinWorld Tether USDT: Massive 1 Billion Minting Sparks Crucial Market Shift The cryptocurrency world is abuzz once again, this time with a significant development reported by the vigilant eyes of Whale Alert. A staggering 1 billion Tether USDT has been minted at the Tether Treasury. This isn’t just a number; it’s a colossal injection of capital into the digital asset ecosystem, potentially signaling a pivotal shift in market dynamics. For anyone invested in or observing the crypto space, understanding the implications of such a massive USDT minting event is absolutely crucial. Tether USDT: What Does This Massive Minting Truly Signify? Tether USDT stands as the undisputed titan among stablecoins, a digital asset designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. Its primary function is to provide liquidity and a safe haven for traders within the volatile cryptocurrency markets, allowing them to move in and out of positions without converting back to traditional fiat currency. The minting of 1 billion new USDT tokens by Tether Treasury, as flagged by Whale Alert, represents a substantial expansion of its circulating stablecoin supply . This isn’t a random occurrence; Tether mints new tokens primarily in response to increased demand from institutional and retail investors looking to acquire more stablecoins for various purposes, including: On-ramping Capital: New investors or large funds entering the crypto market often use USDT as their initial gateway. Arbitrage Opportunities: Traders use USDT to exploit price differences across various exchanges. Hedging Against Volatility: During market downturns, traders often convert volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum into stablecoins like USDT to preserve capital. Decoding USDT Minting: Why the Sudden Surge in Stablecoin Supply? When we talk about USDT minting , it’s important to clarify that this isn’t like a central bank printing physical money. Instead, it refers to the digital creation of new tokens on a blockchain, backed by an equivalent amount of reserves held by Tether. This recent 1 billion USDT issuance suggests a significant demand for stablecoins in the market. Several factors could be driving this surge: Institutional Inflow: Large institutions or ‘whales’ might be preparing to deploy significant capital into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. Minting new USDT is often the first step in this process. Market Anticipation: There might be a collective expectation of future market movements, prompting traders to accumulate stablecoins for quick deployment. Exchange Demand: Crypto exchanges might be requesting more USDT to meet the liquidity needs of their users, especially for high-volume trading pairs like BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT. The consistent growth in stablecoin supply , particularly from Tether, underscores its integral role in facilitating transactions and providing a stable anchor in the fast-paced crypto landscape. How Does This Impact Crypto Market Liquidity and Beyond? The immediate and most direct consequence of a massive USDT minting event is its effect on crypto market liquidity . Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. A larger supply of USDT means: Increased Buying Power: More USDT available translates to more capital ready to be deployed into other cryptocurrencies, potentially driving up prices. Smoother Transactions: High liquidity reduces slippage, meaning large orders can be filled without significantly moving the market price against the trader. Enhanced Trading Opportunities: With abundant stablecoin supply, traders have more flexibility to execute complex strategies and capitalize on market movements. Historically, significant USDT mints have often preceded upward movements in Bitcoin and altcoin prices, as the newly minted stablecoins are eventually used to purchase other digital assets. While correlation does not always imply causation, the pattern is frequently observed and closely monitored by market participants. This influx of capital can be a powerful catalyst for broader market activity. Whale Alert’s Role: Shedding Light on On-Chain Movements The initial report of this 1 billion USDT minting came from Whale Alert , a popular blockchain tracking service. Whale Alert plays a vital role in the crypto ecosystem by monitoring and reporting large transactions across various blockchains. Their automated alerts provide real-time transparency into the movements of significant amounts of cryptocurrency, including stablecoin minting and burning events. This transparency is crucial for several reasons: Market Insight: It allows traders and analysts to gain immediate insight into potential market shifts and liquidity changes. Accountability: By publicly tracking Tether’s minting activities, Whale Alert contributes to greater accountability from stablecoin issuers regarding their supply and reserves. Community Awareness: It keeps the broader crypto community informed about major on-chain events that could influence asset prices and market sentiment. Without services like Whale Alert, such significant events might go unnoticed by the wider public, hindering informed decision-making within the decentralized financial landscape. Navigating the Waters: Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights The minting of 1 billion Tether USDT , while largely seen as a positive indicator for potential market activity and increased crypto market liquidity , also comes with its own set of considerations and challenges. Benefits: Market Stability: USDT provides a crucial stable peg in a volatile market, allowing for easier entry and exit points. Global Accessibility: Facilitates cross-border transactions and remittances with lower fees and faster speeds than traditional banking. Foundation for DeFi: A large stablecoin supply is essential for the growth and functionality of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, providing reliable collateral and trading pairs. Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Tether, like other stablecoin issuers, faces ongoing regulatory pressure regarding the transparency and auditing of its reserves. Centralization Concerns: While USDT operates on decentralized blockchains, its issuance is centralized, leading to debates about control and potential single points of failure. Market Manipulation Fears: Critics sometimes raise concerns that large mints could be used to artificially inflate market prices, though no definitive proof has ever been established. Actionable Insights: For investors and enthusiasts, this event offers a few key takeaways: Stay Informed: Monitor Whale Alert and other on-chain analytics to track significant movements. Understand the Context: Don’t just react to a minting event; consider the broader market sentiment, economic indicators, and regulatory landscape. Risk Management: While increased liquidity can signal potential upside, always practice sound risk management and diversify your portfolio. In conclusion, the minting of 1 billion Tether USDT is more than just a transaction; it’s a significant event that reflects the ongoing expansion and evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights Tether’s central role in providing liquidity and underscores the growing demand for stablecoins as essential tools for navigating the digital asset space. While the immediate impact often points towards increased buying pressure and enhanced crypto market liquidity , it also serves as a reminder of the need for transparency and informed decision-making in this rapidly evolving financial frontier. The watchful eyes of services like Whale Alert ensure that such crucial movements do not go unnoticed, empowering the community with valuable real-time data.

2025-07-04T05:44:07,"Tom Lee’s Bullish Ethereum Bet Sends Bitmine Stock Surging 3,000%","Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is “the most bullish thing to happen to Ethereum this year,” opined Ryan Sean Adams, co-founder of Bankless, on Friday. Bitcoin bull Lee has made some famous predictions about BTC, stating on CNBC in 2017 that it would reach $55,000 when it was trading around $2,000 at the time. This was at the time when JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon said he would fire any trader who touched Bitcoin, and billionaire Warren Buffett called it “rat poisoned squared,” observed Adams. Bitmine Stock to The Moon Earlier this week, Lee launched a $250 million Ethereum treasury for his company Bitmine. He has effectively become for Ethereum what Michael Saylor is for Bitcoin. He also went on CNBC and said Ethereum is the next Bitcoin, stablecoins are crypto’s ChatGPT moment, and they make ETH more valuable. “Underneath the stablecoin industry is Ethereum – that is really the backbone and architecture of stablecoins, so it’s important to create a project that accumulates Ethereum to essentially protect and have some influence on the network.” The market has already reacted with Bitmine Immersion Technologies stock (BNMR) surging a whopping 2,934% since the announcement, according to Google Finance. The share price topped $140 on Thursday, surging from last week’s closing price of $4.27. Source: Google Finance Adams concluded that this is the best thing to happen to Ethereum this year. “You think Wall Street isn’t listening this time? Get ready for FOMO season. ETH is going up,” he said. Let me tell you why Tom Lee is the most bullish thing to happen to ETH this year. Tom Lee was the guy in 2017 on CNBC calling for $55k bitcoin when it was trading at $2k.

Joseph Lubin’s gaming firm, SharpLink, has also raised $425 million to stack and stake Ethereum. SharpLink Gaming will ring the Nasdaq closing bell on July 7 to celebrate its Ethereum treasury milestone, the firm announced on Thursday. “We believe Ethereum is integral to the next wave of financial innovation,” stated Joseph Lubin. ETH Prices Still Sideways Nevertheless, Ethereum prices are still sideways, with many observers pointing out that it is trading like a stablecoin for lack of movement. The asset reclaimed $2,600 during late trading on Thursday but couldn’t hold above that level and retreated slightly on Friday morning. Analyst ‘Merlijn The Trader’ observed that Ethereum had “just nailed the retest” and “bounced perfectly off the breakout zone.” “This is where the next wave starts,” he predicted. ETH still needs to reclaim and hold the $2,800 level before any further momentum can be measured.

2025-07-04T05:41:36,"FTX Repayment Blocked in 49 Regions Due to Crypto Restrictions","The post FTX Repayment Blocked in 49 Regions Due to Crypto Restrictions appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The FTX Recovery Trust has officially frozen creditor payouts in 49 jurisdictions where crypto activity is restricted or banned, citing the need for legal confirmation before proceeding. The move was disclosed in a July 2 court filing and primarily affects regions such as China, Nigeria, Fiji, Andorra, and Zimbabwe. While these jurisdictions account for only 5% of total allowed claims, a staggering 82% of the frozen value originates from China alone. Due to local laws in these regions, FTX is facing regulatory uncertainty over whether it can legally distribute funds to residents. What Happens If Users Are From These Jurisdictions? FTX has implemented a “hold-and-review” system where all claims from restricted countries are now classified as “disputed.” The Recovery Trust will only process these claims if legal advice confirms that distributions won’t violate local laws. Until then, no funds will be released to these users. Once the court signs off on the process, each impacted creditor will receive a “Restricted Jurisdiction Notice.” This document will detail why the creditor is affected and give them a deadline, at least 45 days, to object. FTX: Restricted countries Disputed claims 49 Jurisdictions -5% allowed claims in restricted countries 82% of value in China Due to local laws that 1) crypto currency trading is not permitted or 2) distributors not allowed pic.twitter.com/wCEfAOFyaD — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) July 3, 2025 The situation has sparked debate among creditors, with some pointing out that users who have moved to crypto-friendly countries are still unable to access their claims. FTX Creditor advocate Sunil Kavuri said it might be possible to transfer or sell claims to entities in allowed jurisdictions, though it’s unclear if this is a guaranteed fix. Creditors Retaliate In response to FTX, Chinese FTX creditor Will的折腾纪 (@zhetengji) announced that he’s taking legal action after FTX froze payouts to users in countries like China. He’s already contacted his New York lawyer and plans to object at every stage. Will says the move is unfair because, even though crypto trading is restricted in China, people are still allowed to hold crypto and U.S. dollars overseas. Since FTX is settling claims in USD, he questions why wire transfers aren’t allowed. He’s urging other affected users not to stay silent and to join him in challenging the decision. Disputed Claims Shrinking In a positive update, FTX also updated its numbers, revealing that the total amount of disputed claims has dropped from $6.5 billion to $4.6 billion. Around $1.8 billion in previously disputed claims have been approved, and another $2.7 billion is expected to be allowed soon. So far, the total value of approved claims has reached $8.3 billion, offering some relief to creditors waiting for clarity. Until resolved, all affected claims will remain disputed, leaving billions of dollars hanging in legal limbo.

2025-07-04T05:30:54,"Bitcoin’s Strategic Leap: Consortium Acquires Thai Retailer DV8, Pioneering Southeast Asia’s Crypto Future","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Strategic Leap: Consortium Acquires Thai Retailer DV8, Pioneering Southeast Asia’s Crypto Future The corporate world is witnessing a fascinating shift, with Bitcoin increasingly moving beyond individual investment portfolios and into the strategic reserves of companies. A groundbreaking development has recently captured headlines: a powerful Bitcoin acquisition consortium, spearheaded by key backers of Metaplanet, is set to acquire the prominent Thai retailer DV8 . This bold move signals a significant push to expand Bitcoin treasury strategies across Southeast Asia, potentially setting a new precedent for corporate finance in the region. What Does This Bitcoin Acquisition of Thai Retailer DV8 Mean? This isn’t just another corporate takeover; it’s a statement. The consortium, which includes Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich and influential investors from UTXO, Sora Ventures, and Kliff Capital, is making a clear play to integrate Bitcoin directly into the public markets of Southeast Asia. For Thai retailer DV8 , this acquisition could mean a complete overhaul of its financial operations, moving towards a treasury strategy centered on Bitcoin. Metaplanet, a publicly traded company known for its aggressive adoption of Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, serves as a beacon for this strategy. Their success in navigating the volatility and benefits of Bitcoin holdings has inspired other entities to consider similar paths. This consortium aims to replicate and expand upon that model, bringing the power of Bitcoin’s decentralized nature to traditional retail. This initiative goes beyond mere investment; it’s about establishing a new financial paradigm where a traditional business integrates a cutting-edge digital asset into its core operations. It poses questions about the future of corporate finance and how companies will manage their capital in an increasingly digital world. Why is the Southeast Asia Crypto Market a New Frontier for Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? Southeast Asia is a dynamic region with a rapidly growing digital economy and a tech-savvy population. Countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines have shown immense enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies, making the Southeast Asia crypto market ripe for innovation. This acquisition is strategically placed to tap into this burgeoning interest. The benefits of adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy in such a market are multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: In economies where traditional currencies might face inflationary pressures, Bitcoin offers a potential hedge against the erosion of purchasing power. Global Liquidity: Bitcoin provides unparalleled global liquidity, allowing for faster and cheaper cross-border transactions and access to a worldwide pool of capital. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets away from traditional fiat currencies and conventional investments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Innovation and Branding: For a company like DV8, embracing Bitcoin can enhance its brand image as forward-thinking and technologically advanced, attracting a new generation of consumers. However, this frontier also presents unique challenges, particularly regarding regulatory clarity and market volatility, which require careful navigation. The Visionaries Behind the Deal: Metaplanet and Its Allies At the heart of this transformative Bitcoin acquisition is Metaplanet , a company that has already demonstrated a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Their decision to convert a significant portion of their treasury into BTC has made them a case study for corporate Bitcoin adoption. The consortium brings together a wealth of expertise: Simon Gerovich (Metaplanet CEO): A leading voice in corporate Bitcoin adoption, bringing strategic vision and experience from Metaplanet’s own successful treasury strategy. UTXO: Known for its deep understanding of Bitcoin’s technical and financial aspects, providing critical insights into secure and efficient Bitcoin management. Sora Ventures: A venture capital firm focused on blockchain and cryptocurrency, offering connections and foresight into emerging trends within the Southeast Asia crypto market . Kliff Capital: A financial entity with expertise in capital markets and strategic investments, ensuring the acquisition is financially sound and well-executed. This combination of financial acumen, technological insight, and a shared belief in Bitcoin’s future underpins the consortium’s ambitious plans for DV8. Transforming Thai Retailer DV8: A New Chapter with Bitcoin For the Thai retailer DV8 , this acquisition marks a pivotal moment. While the exact operational changes remain to be seen, the intent is clear: to integrate Bitcoin into its very fabric. This could manifest in several ways: Potential Impacts on DV8: Aspect Traditional Approach Bitcoin Integration Potential Treasury Management Fiat currency reserves, traditional investments. Significant portion of reserves held in BTC, managed with a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy . Customer Payments Cash, credit/debit cards, mobile payments. Acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for purchases. Loyalty Programs Points-based systems, discounts. Blockchain-based loyalty tokens, Bitcoin rewards. Supply Chain Finance Traditional bank transfers, credit. Faster, cheaper settlements with suppliers using Bitcoin. Brand Perception Traditional retail brand. Innovative, tech-forward brand appealing to crypto-native consumers in the Southeast Asia crypto market . This transformation could position DV8 as a pioneer in the Thai retail sector, attracting a new demographic of consumers and potentially inspiring other businesses to follow suit. The move highlights how traditional businesses can leverage digital assets for competitive advantage. Navigating the Risks: Implementing a Robust Bitcoin Treasury Strategy While the potential benefits are significant, experts caution that adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy , especially for financially struggling companies, comes with inherent risks. The volatile nature of Bitcoin’s price is a primary concern, as significant price swings can impact a company’s balance sheet. Key risks and considerations include: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the value of treasury holdings. Companies must have a clear risk management framework. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, particularly in the Southeast Asia crypto market . Changes in regulations could impact operations and compliance. Security Concerns: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols to prevent hacks and theft. Custody solutions and internal controls are crucial. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting treatment and tax implications of holding Bitcoin can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. Public Perception: While innovative, the move could also be perceived as risky by some investors or customers, requiring careful communication. For companies considering a similar path, it is imperative to conduct thorough due diligence, establish clear risk mitigation strategies, and potentially start with a smaller allocation before scaling up. The success of this Bitcoin acquisition for DV8 will heavily depend on how effectively these risks are managed. Broader Implications for the Future of Corporate Finance The acquisition of Thai retailer DV8 by a Bitcoin consortium could serve as a powerful blueprint for future corporate treasury strategies worldwide. It signals a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate, long-term asset class for businesses, not just individuals. This trend could accelerate the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, pushing for clearer regulatory frameworks and more sophisticated financial products tailored for corporate Bitcoin holders. This bold step in the Southeast Asia crypto market highlights the innovative spirit driving the digital asset space. It underscores a belief that Bitcoin can offer a new path for companies seeking financial resilience, operational efficiency, and a competitive edge in an increasingly digital global economy. Conclusion: A New Era for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption The acquisition of Thai retailer DV8 by a consortium led by Metaplanet backers marks a significant milestone in the journey of corporate Bitcoin adoption. It’s a strategic move designed to integrate Bitcoin treasury strategies deeply within Southeast Asia’s public markets, promising innovation and a potential new era for traditional businesses. While challenges and risks, particularly related to market volatility and regulatory uncertainty, are undeniable, the bold vision behind this Bitcoin acquisition could pave the way for other companies to explore similar paths. As the Southeast Asia crypto market continues to evolve, this development will undoubtedly be watched closely as a test case for Bitcoin’s role in mainstream corporate finance.

2025-07-04T05:30:00,"Arthur Hayes Warns of Bitcoin Dip as Mining Stocks Climb","Bitcoin and crypto mining stocks advanced sharply this week, buoyed by favorable macroeconomic signals and renewed investor confidence in a soft landing for the US economy. While Bitcoin briefly crossed $110,000 and mining equities surged between 13% and 28%, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes cautioned that a temporary pullback could follow after President Trump signs his “Big Beautiful Bill” into law. Hayes pointed to the US Treasury’s likely debt issuance and its impact on liquidity as a reason for short-term concern, even as broader market conditions continue to favor digital assets. Arthur Hayes Warns Bitcoin Rally May Be Interrupted as Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” Nears Signature Bitcoin's price climbed past $110,000 early Thursday, putting the flagship cryptocurrency within striking distance of its all-time high. But according to crypto entrepreneur and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, a temporary pullback is likely—even as bullish momentum continues. In a new blog post published Wednesday, titled ”Quid Pro Stablecoin,” Hayes warned that a major shift in US fiscal policy could dampen market enthusiasm in the short term. At the center of his analysis is President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping piece of legislation that proposes tax cuts and an expanded debt ceiling. The bill passed the House of Representatives Thursday and previously cleared the Senate, with Trump expected to sign it into law on Friday, which coincides with the July 4th Independence Day holiday. “Proceed with caution,” Hayes advised in his blog. “The bull market might be interrupted for a short period of time.” Treasury Liquidity Drain Could Trigger Bitcoin Dip Hayes’ primary concern centers on the US Treasury’s next steps after the bill is signed. The former BitMEX CEO believes that the Treasury will likely refill its General Account, a move that typically involves issuing a large amount of debt—pulling liquidity out of risk-on markets like crypto. In Hayes' view, this process could cause a short-term correction in Bitcoin’s price, potentially pushing it back down to $90,000 before resuming its upward trajectory. Still, Hayes remains bullish on the longer-term picture for Bitcoin , maintaining that broader macroeconomic conditions—such as high national debt, inflationary pressures, and central bank money printing—create a supportive backdrop for BTC’s rise. Hayes’ warning comes amid a broader debate on how Trump’s second-term economic agenda will impact markets. The “Big Beautiful Bill” includes tax cuts that could increase consumer spending and corporate profits but will also require significant new borrowing—sparking concerns about long-term inflation and fiscal sustainability. Hayes also addressed the increasing involvement of the US government in the stablecoin sector. Stablecoins—digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar—are often touted as solutions for faster payments and decentralized finance. But Hayes believes the government’s interest lies elsewhere. He argued that the real motivation is reducing the national deficit. His comments refer to the recently passed GENIUS Act, which provides a regulatory framework for issuing and trading stablecoins in the US. Hayes criticized the act for favoring big banks over private crypto companies, suggesting that financial institutions could issue government-backed stablecoins to buy US Treasury bills—essentially digitizing the debt market and locking in institutional demand. Hayes Still Sees Bitcoin at $1 Million by 2028 Despite his near-term concerns, Hayes remains one of the crypto market’s most vocal bulls. In May, he said Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin by 2028, predicting that investors would shift capital from US Treasuries into hard assets like Bitcoin amid growing distrust of fiat-based financial systems. That view aligns with other long-term Bitcoin maximalists who argue that sovereign debt levels and monetary easing policies will inevitably erode trust in traditional currencies and drive demand for decentralized alternatives. As the US prepares for another round of expansive fiscal policy under President Trump, the coming weeks could prove pivotal for the cryptocurrency market. For now, Hayes says to expect some turbulence. Crypto Mining Stocks Surge as Macroeconomic Optimism Fuels Soft-Landing Hopes Meanwhile, crypto mining stocks recorded impressive gains this week, bolstered by renewed optimism that the US Federal Reserve could achieve a “soft landing” for the economy without triggering a major recession. Despite a mild pullback on Thursday, shares of major public miners like Riot Platforms (RIOT), Hive Digital (HIVE), Hut 8 (HUT8), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Bitfarms (BITF) soared between 13% and 28% over the past four trading sessions. The performance of crypto mining stocks from June 30 to July 3, 2025 (Source: Google Finance) The rally in digital asset equities comes as broader US markets also surged to new highs in a holiday-shortened week. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index ended Thursday’s session at record levels, propelled by stronger-than-expected labor market data and easing inflationary concerns. Markets closed early on Thursday in observance of the July 4th Independence Day holiday weekend, but that didn’t stop crypto-related equities from building on earlier momentum. Bitcoin Miners Outperform Amid Strong Jobs Data The immediate catalyst for the Thursday rally was the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payrolls report, which showed the economy added 147,000 jobs in June—beating analysts’ expectations. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1% from 4.3%, further signaling labor market resilience. Though workforce participation fell to its lowest point since 2022—partly due to tightening immigration policies—investors interpreted the report as evidence that the US economy remains fundamentally strong, and that the Fed may still have room to ease interest rates later this year. The performance of publicly traded Bitcoin miners reflected that optimism. Hive Digital and Hut 8 both logged gains over 20% for the week, while Riot and MARA climbed over 15%. Bitfarms, which has struggled in past quarters, led the pack with an almost 28% weekly gain. Crypto-focused ETF products also saw a lift. VanEck’s Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP)—which tracks 24 publicly listed digital asset firms including Coinbase (COIN), Circle (CRCL), and Strategy (MSTR)—rose 3.2% on Thursday alone and is now up more than 20% year-to-date, according to Yahoo Finance. The VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) is up over 20% year-to-date (Source: Yahoo Finance ) Bitcoin’s Price Holds Steady Near $110K Bitcoin itself held steady through the trading week, reaching a high of $110,541 on Friday before easing back during midday trading. The steady performance of Bitcoin provided additional tailwinds to mining firms, which often move in tandem with BTC price action due to their operational leverage. As Bitcoin prices approach their all-time highs, mining revenues and profitability expectations also rise, drawing increased investor interest into the sector. According to Matt Mena, a crypto research strategist at 21Shares, the macroeconomic backdrop is increasingly favorable for the digital asset sector—even if the Federal Reserve holds off on immediate rate cuts. Mena cited improving risk sentiment, falling inflation expectations, and the growing likelihood of regulatory clarity through key legislation—such as the market structure bill and the GENIUS Act—as pivotal factors. These developments could help legitimize crypto as an investable asset class while removing barriers for institutional adoption. Regulation, ETFs, and Long-Term Tailwinds Recent legislative developments, including the passage of the GENIUS Act—which sets a legal framework for stablecoin issuance and trading—are also being viewed positively by investors. Additionally, the anticipated expansion of crypto ETFs and tokenized asset platforms is generating renewed excitement in traditional financial circles. The growing linkage between macroeconomic policy, digital asset markets, and equity performance is becoming more apparent, especially as Bitcoin matures and institutional exposure increases. The strong weekly gains in mining stocks highlight how sensitive the sector is to shifting economic winds—and why many view it as a barometer for broader crypto market health.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9802/arthur-hayes-warns-of-bitcoin-dip-as-mining-stocks-climb,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MINING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T05:15:58,"Analysts Highlight These 4 Coins as the Best Crypto Coins to Invest in Now Before July Rallies Play Out","The market is already flashing signals that something is building up. From bullish trading patterns to developer milestones, this month is shaping up to be one of the most decisive stretches of the year. Some tokens have started gaining traction based on merit, not marketing. They’re backed by community participation, integrated utility, and unique on-chain functions that can’t be replicated. Among the names gaining strong traction right now is Qubetics —a project that not only made waves with a 950% post-launch move but is also gaining attention for its decentralized VPN application and cross-chain trading model. In this article, four standout altcoins have been shortlisted that analysts say are showing signs of being the best crypto coins to invest in now. Alongside Qubetics, three more serious contenders—Arweave, Toncoin, and Stacks—are also gaining ground through developer adoption, protocol upgrades, or ecosystem expansions. While none of these projects rely on short-term speculation, all of them offer meaningful reasons to be watched closely as the July rallies unfold. 1. Qubetics Redefines Internet Privacy with Its Blockchain-Powered dVPN Unlike traditional VPN services that are prone to data leaks, censorship, and centralization issues, Qubetics has rolled out a decentralized VPN (dVPN) application designed to provide complete privacy through a peer-to-peer network. Instead of routing traffic through centralized servers that can be compromised or censored, the Qubetics dVPN operates on a blockchain-verified protocol where user data is encrypted and transmitted anonymously across multiple nodes. There’s no single point of failure and no authority logging user data. One of the standout features is that users contributing bandwidth are rewarded in $TICS tokens, creating a real incentive model within the ecosystem. The system relies on multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption, ensuring both identity masking and secure data transmission. This structure positions the Qubetics dVPN not as a bolt-on product, but a core application with growing relevance in global regions facing internet restrictions. To put this into perspective, blockchain projects like Sentinel previously attempted dVPN solutions, but Qubetics sets itself apart by building this into its Layer 1 architecture directly. That makes the privacy tool faster, more secure, and more scalable. With cross-chain capabilities and token incentives included, Qubetics adds yet another reason why it’s among the best crypto coins to invest in now . Qubetics Launch Surged 950%, Hits Top 10 Rankings, and Delivers Cross-Chain Utility From the moment Qubetics launched, it didn’t just perform—it made a statement. The token debuted at $0.40 and climbed to an all-time high of $4.20 within the first 60 minutes. This resulted in a 950% price jump from launch, and a 420x return for early-stage participants who bought in at the $0.01 presale rate. For example, anyone who placed $5,000 into Qubetics during presale received 500,000 tokens. At its peak price of $4.20, that would translate into a $2.1 million value. These numbers are backed by more than momentum. Qubetics raised over $18.4 million from more than 28,500 buyers during its presale. Now, it’s trending among the top 10 most active tokens on CoinMarketCap. Its governance operates through Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), a system where validators must hold at least 25,000 $TICS to earn a 30% APY, while delegators only need 5,000 $TICS to stake and share validator rewards. Beyond staking, Qubetics eliminates the need to jump between platforms for cross-chain transactions. It offers seamless buying, trading, and selling of assets across Bitcoin and other chains, all without bridges, excessive fees, or identity checks. The support level remains strong at $2, showing significant buy pressure and technical defense. MEXC trading volume in the first 24 hours alone exceeded $700,000, a sign of robust market interest. Why This Coin Made it to This List Qubetics combines staking incentives, dVPN functionality, a 420x early return, and cross-chain compatibility into one Layer 1 protocol. With growing activity and a strong Delegated Proof of Stake ( DPoS ) base, it’s among the best-positioned projects and easily ranks as one of the best crypto coins to invest in now. 2. Arweave Draws Developer Interest with Permanent Blockchain Storage Arweave continues to secure its place as the go-to decentralized storage protocol with a permanent data preservation model. Rather than relying on traditional servers or cloud subscriptions, Arweave offers a blockchain-native solution where data is saved forever with a one-time payment. This approach has become increasingly relevant as projects in Web3, decentralized social media, and NFT archiving search for trustworthy backend infrastructure. Over the last few months, developer interest in Arweave has grown significantly. Protocols requiring immutable storage, such as front-end dApp hosts and DAOs, are migrating toward Arweave because of its scalability and permanence. Its Proof of Access system ensures that old data is continually retrieved and validated, reinforcing the reliability of the stored content. Integrations with protocols across Ethereum and Solana ecosystems have increased Arweave’s visibility. Decentralized frontends now rely on Arweave to avoid central points of failure, which makes it a natural infrastructure piece in multi-chain applications. Why This Coin Made it to This List Arweave provides a foundational utility that meets rising demand from serious Web3 builders. With growing integrations and developer trust, it earns a clear spot among the best crypto coins to invest in now. 3. Toncoin Expands Ecosystem Beyond Telegram Integrations Toncoin is no longer just tied to Telegram—it’s building a full-fledged blockchain ecosystem. This month, Toncoin saw upgrades in smart contract functionalities and network scalability. Developers are now working on enabling a broader range of applications, including decentralized finance platforms and on-chain gaming infrastructure, using Toncoin’s low-fee, high-speed settlement system. A big push in Toncoin’s adoption is coming from community developers integrating its services directly into Telegram. From wallet bots and staking tools to peer-to-peer swaps, Toncoin offers access to crypto tools without needing external platforms or third-party apps. That’s a huge advantage for onboarding non-technical users in regions where banking access is limited or expensive. Toncoin has also attracted attention from third-party projects launching NFT marketplaces, gaming protocols, and even DeFi services. These additions are boosting activity and pushing the chain toward mainstream crypto discussions. Why This Coin Made it to This List Toncoin’s growing DeFi framework, direct integration with one of the largest messaging platforms, and community-fueled innovations make it a compelling pick. It has the infrastructure and engagement to justify its place as one of the best crypto coins to invest in now. 4. Stacks Becomes the Missing Layer Between Bitcoin and DeFi Stacks is quietly becoming essential infrastructure for Bitcoin. It brings smart contract capabilities to the Bitcoin network, unlocking opportunities for DeFi, DAOs, NFTs, and more—all while using Bitcoin as the final settlement layer. That’s powerful in a space where Bitcoin’s security is unmatched but its programmability is lacking. With its upcoming Nakamoto upgrade, Stacks is aiming to reduce confirmation times dramatically, making it more suitable for faster DeFi operations and real-time applications. The upgrade also strengthens decentralization and network reliability. Meanwhile, projects are already building on Stacks using Clarity, its smart contract language, to bring user-friendly apps to Bitcoin-based users. Stacks’ ability to act as the “application layer” of Bitcoin gives it a unique position. It does not compete with Ethereum or Solana but complements Bitcoin directly. Why This Coin Made it to This List Stacks addresses a gap that no other Layer 1 or Layer 2 fully fills. It offers a new use case for Bitcoin without compromising on security, solidifying its spot among the best crypto coins to invest in now. What These Picks Reveal About the Best Crypto Coins to Invest in Now These four projects—Qubetics, Arweave, Toncoin, and Stacks—are backed by clear real-world application, measurable activity, and protocol growth. Each one is building something more than price speculation. Qubetics remains at the top of the watchlist with its dVPN service, Layer 1 interoperability, and strong staking rewards via Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). Arweave continues to serve as the backbone of decentralized storage. Toncoin is evolving into a true application hub with Telegram-native tools. Stacks gives Bitcoin new utility without compromising on trust or decentralization. For community members seeking the best crypto coins to invest in now, these projects aren’t just viable—they are timely. July’s rallies could reward those looking in the right direction. Early participation, especially in coins with use cases already in play, has historically produced the strongest returns.

2025-07-04T05:08:38,"Solana (SOL) Cools After Recovery — Resistance Proving Difficult to Crack","Solana started a recovery wave above the $150 zone. SOL price is now correcting gains and might struggle to rise above the $155 resistance. SOL price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $155 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading near $152 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $151 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $156 resistance zone. Solana Price Trims Gains Solana price started a decent increase after it cleared the $150 resistance, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $152 level to enter a short-term positive zone. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $160 swing high to the $144 low. However, the bears were active near the $156 resistance. They protected a move above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $160 swing high to the $144 low. The price is now moving lower and trading below the $154 level. Solana is now trading near $152 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $151 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $155 level. The next major resistance is near the $156 level. The main resistance could be $160. A successful close above the $160 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $162. Any more gains might send the price toward the $165 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $155 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $150 zone. The first major support is near the $146 level. A break below the $146 level might send the price toward the $142 zone. If there is a close below the $142 support, the price could decline toward the $136 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $150 and $146. Major Resistance Levels – $155 and $160.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/solana-sol-cools-155/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE","Technical analysis|Sol|Solana|solbtc|SOLUSD|SOLUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T04:57:00,"Bitcoin Volatility Today: How Will Crypto Markets React When $3B BTC Options Expire","Around 27,300 Bitcoin options contracts will expire on Friday, July 4, and they have a notional value of roughly $3 billion. This event is much smaller than last week’s end of month and end of the second quarter, so there is unlikely to be any impact on spot markets. They have ticked up towards the end of the week as economic data from the US was favourable. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1, meaning that the longs and the shorts are evenly matched. There is also a max pain point of $106,000, around $3,000 below current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $115,000, $120,000, and $140,000 strike prices, with more than $1.5 billion at each level. However, OI at lower prices has decreased, suggesting more bullish sentiment among derivatives speculators. “With macro quiet and volumes drifting lower, traders are gradually adding exposure” to Bitcoin futures, Deribit noted this week. Options Expiry Alert After last week’s massive $17B expiry, tomorrow brings a quieter setup, but still sizable. $BTC : $2.98B notional | Put/Call: 1.01 | Max Pain: $106K BTC now trades above $109K, will it hold into expiry or snap back toward max pain? $ETH : $584M notional… pic.twitter.com/CvFl5Ngviq — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) July 3, 2025 In its weekly market update , crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the group was showing “strong bearish sentiment with traders expressing frustration over stagnant market conditions and volatility remaining elevated.” It added that key levels being watched include $92,000 as a major target; however, this was published before Bitcoin’s Thursday move above $109,500. In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 220,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring, with a notional value of $584 million, a max pain point of $2,500, and a put/call ratio of 1.28. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $3.6 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization has lost 2% over the past 24 hours, climbing to $3.64 trillion at the time of writing. However, markets have traded tightly around this range for the past couple of months. Bitcoin spiked above $110,000 during late trading on Thursday but had fallen back to $109,500 during the Friday morning Asian trading session. The asset is now at the upper bound of its range-bound channel and just 2% away from a new all-time high. “Bitcoin just needs to stay above $108,890 for the rest of the week to position itself for a bullish weekly close above the final major resistance,” said analyst Rekt Capital. Ethereum had reclaimed $2,600 on Thursday and was trading just below that level on Friday morning. ETH has also struggled to gain much momentum over the past two months.

Onchain data has revealed that a large number of crypto whales made significant transactions today. According to data, a fresh crypto whale wallet that was recently created withdrew 150 million SAHARA tokens worth $12.1 million via Binance today. On the other hand, a crypto whale who participated in Ethereum’s first sale event, the ICO event, moved $2.6 million worth of ETH to Kraken. The whale wallet still holds 3,000 ETH worth $7.79 million. This whale received 100,000 ETH at the ICO event, paying a total of $31,100. Related News: Company Known as the MicroStrategy of Solana Purchases Massive Amount of SOL Another crypto whale made a really interesting but sad move for himself. The whale wallet spent $1.59 million to buy a memecoin called COMPANY and sold it for $16,283 just a minute later. As a result, the whale wallet lost $1.58 million in less than a minute. Finally, a crypto whale wallet deposited $8.76 million worth of USDC into decentralized crypto exchange Hyperliquid and then purchased $8.66 million worth of HYPE tokens. The average HYPE purchase price for the whale wallet was $40.13. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T04:30:30,"⚖️ MAGACOIN FINANCE vs Bitcoin: Who Wins Q4 Gains? Analysts Note Stellar’s Growth Stalls","Crypto investors are lining up new plays to outperform the market into year’s end. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines with record ETF inflows and a strengthening macro sentiment, many traders are betting on emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for bigger gains. Meanwhile, Stellar’s recent momentum is showing signs of slowing, adding to the rotation toward newer, narrative-driven assets. With capital looking for the next big move, analysts are closely watching how MAGACOIN FINANCE and Bitcoin will stack up this quarter , and what Stellar’s stagnation means for the broader altcoin landscape. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outpace Bitcoin in Q4 MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rising to the top of crypto watchlists. This decentralized political meme coin brings together viral branding with real governance and a strictly capped supply, making it one of the more intriguing altcoins heading into the final stretch of 2025. Every round of its presale is drawing millions in investment, underpinned by HashEx smart contract audit and clear supply limitations (170B tokens). That combination of meme energy, fixed supply, and transparent roadmap gives MAGACOIN FINANCE the potential to outperform Bitcoin on a percentage basis. While Bitcoin might double from here, early investors in MAGACOIN FINANCE are looking for multiples far beyond that — the kind of exponential gains last seen with early DOGE and SHIB cycles. Bitcoin’s Macro Strengthens as ETF Demand Surges Still, it’s impossible to ignore Bitcoin’s momentum. BTC has firmly held above $100K , driven by massive ETF inflows, easing global tensions, and expectations of rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve. BlackRock, along with several state-backed initiatives, continues to accumulate Bitcoin, pushing its market dominance past 65% , a level not seen in four years. Some forecasts even place Bitcoin at $150,000 by year-end , mirroring post-halving surges from past cycles in 2013, 2017, and 2021. But for traders with higher risk appetite seeking massive returns, the sentiment is shifting. They’re moving capital into high-upside projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , hoping to catch early exponential waves Bitcoin can no longer offer this late in its maturity curve. Stellar’s Growth Stalls as Investors Look Elsewhere Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) — which showed strong momentum earlier this year on news of Mastercard integrations and PayPal preparing PYUSD stablecoin launches — is starting to stall. Despite new smart contract upgrades under Protocol 23 and bullish targets that once stretched toward $1 , Stellar’s DeFi footprint remains limited. Recent weeks have seen trading volumes and developer activity on Stellar taper off, causing analysts to temper forecasts. Some liquidity is rotating away from XLM into more strong altcoins with clearer governance and tokenomics — like MAGACOIN FINANCE . For many traders, Stellar’s growth story is losing steam just as MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching fire. Final Thoughts: Who Wins Q4? Bitcoin continues to prove itself as the anchor of the crypto market, with ETF-driven demand and robust institutional participation setting the stage for steady, if not spectacular, gains. Stellar’s once-promising DeFi and payments narrative seems to be on pause, leading some investors to look for fresh stories. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. With its capped supply, third-party audit, and politically charged community pushing long-term governance, it offers the kind of early-stage potential that traders hunting for outsized Q4 gains crave. As the final months of 2025 unfold, MAGACOIN FINANCE may prove to be one of the most talked-about altcoins in the market.
