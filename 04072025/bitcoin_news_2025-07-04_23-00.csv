2025-07-04T20:58:08,"Sweden’s Minister of Justice Makes Critical Statements on Cryptocurrency: Issues New Instructions","Swedish Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer has instructed the police, the Tax Office and the Enforcement Office to more effectively identify and seize cryptocurrency assets obtained through crime. Strömmer called for more effective use of the new confiscation law that came into effect in November last year. Thanks to the new legal regulation, if authorities suspect that a person's assets are derived from criminal proceeds and the person cannot explain the source of these assets, these assets can be seized without a conviction. “We are calling on the institutions to increase their cooperation and increase the pressure even further, with a particular focus on assets that generate large profits,” Strömmer said. So far, assets worth 80 million Swedish crowns (about $8.4 million) have been seized. The law also applies to children and mentally ill individuals, according to the Swedish parliament's website. Related News: Famous Bitcoin Analyst Makes New Prediction for BTC Price: “Michael Saylor's Latest Move Points to BTC Price Target of...” The call comes at a time when some MPs in the Riksdag are advocating the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve, following similar steps in countries such as the United States, the Czech Republic and Italy. Supporting the idea, Dennis Dioukarev from the Sweden Democrats welcomed Strömmer’s statements, saying: “I support the confiscation of all illegally obtained assets in order to combat crime and make life difficult for criminals.” Dioukarev said that the confiscated cryptocurrencies should be transferred to the Swedish Central Bank (Riksbank) to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. While the number of people connected to criminal networks in Sweden is stated to have reached 62,000 in 2024, drug traffickers and money launderers are reported to use cryptocurrencies to a significant extent. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T20:40:23,"Rostec’s Bold Move: Unveiling RUBx Stablecoin and RT-Pay Platform in 2025","BitcoinWorld Rostec’s Bold Move: Unveiling RUBx Stablecoin and RT-Pay Platform in 2025 Are you ready for a seismic shift in the world of digital finance? A groundbreaking announcement from Russia’s state-owned defense giant, Rostec , is set to redefine the landscape of national digital payments. In a move that signals a profound commitment to embracing blockchain technology, Rostec has revealed plans to launch its own ruble-pegged stablecoin, RUBx stablecoin , alongside a comprehensive payment platform called RT-Pay. Slated for a 2025 rollout, this initiative is not just about creating a new digital asset; it’s about integrating cutting-edge technology into the very fabric of Russia’s economic infrastructure. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and those monitoring global digital currency trends, this development presents a fascinating case study in how nations are navigating the complex intersection of traditional finance and decentralized innovation. What is the RUBx Stablecoin and Why Tron Blockchain? At the heart of Rostec’s ambitious project lies the RUBx stablecoin , a digital currency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the Russian ruble. This stability is crucial for any digital asset aiming for widespread adoption in everyday transactions, shielding users from the notorious volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The choice of the Tron blockchain as the underlying technology for RUBx is particularly noteworthy. Tron, known for its high transaction throughput and low fees, offers a robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle the anticipated volume of digital payments. This selection underscores a strategic decision to leverage an established, efficient public blockchain rather than developing a proprietary one from scratch, potentially accelerating development and deployment. Stablecoins like RUBx serve as a bridge between the traditional financial system and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi). They offer the speed and transparency of blockchain transactions while mitigating price risk. For Russia, a ruble-pegged stablecoin could offer several advantages: Efficient Cross-Border Transactions: Potentially streamlining international trade, especially with partners amenable to digital assets. Reduced Transaction Costs: Lowering fees associated with traditional banking transfers. Enhanced Financial Inclusion: Providing easier access to digital payments for a wider segment of the population. Programmable Money: Enabling smart contracts for automated payments and complex financial agreements. The decision to utilize an existing, popular blockchain like Tron also implies a degree of interoperability and accessibility that a closed, private blockchain might not offer, potentially fostering broader adoption among external wallets and platforms. Unveiling the RT-Pay Platform: A Game Changer for Russian Digital Payments Complementing the RUBx stablecoin is the RT-Pay platform , envisioned as a comprehensive digital payment ecosystem. According to state news agency TASS, RT-Pay is designed to integrate seamlessly with Russia’s existing banking system, allowing for a smooth transition for users accustomed to traditional financial services. This integration is paramount for widespread adoption, ensuring that digital payments powered by RUBx can flow freely between conventional bank accounts and the new blockchain-based system. The platform’s features are designed to cater to a diverse range of economic sectors, with a particular emphasis on security and innovation: Feature Description Potential Impact Banking System Integration Enables direct transfer of funds between traditional bank accounts and RT-Pay digital wallets. Facilitates mass adoption, reduces friction for users. External Wallet Support Compatibility with various non-custodial and custodial digital wallets. Increases accessibility and user choice, fostering a broader ecosystem. Smart Contracts Automated, self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code. Enables new business models, enhances transparency and efficiency in transactions. Compliance & AML Adherence to local laws and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Ensures legality and security, builds trust with regulators and users. The emphasis on compliance with local laws and anti-money laundering (AML) rules is a critical aspect, distinguishing RT-Pay from more unregulated crypto ventures. This commitment to regulatory adherence is likely to build trust among businesses and individuals, paving the way for wider acceptance within the established financial framework of Russia. The platform’s focus on supporting various economic sectors, from retail to industrial, suggests a broad vision for its utility, positioning it as a foundational layer for future digital economic activity. Russia’s Digital Currency Ambitions: A Strategic Imperative? The development of the RUBx stablecoin and RT-Pay platform by Rostec is not an isolated event but rather fits into a broader narrative of Russia’s digital currency ambitions. In recent years, global powers have been exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other forms of digital money to modernize financial systems, enhance payment efficiency, and maintain monetary sovereignty. For Russia, the geopolitical context, particularly the imposition of international sanctions, has likely accelerated the push towards alternative payment mechanisms that are less reliant on traditional Western-dominated financial infrastructure. While RUBx is a stablecoin issued by a state-owned company rather than a direct CBDC issued by the central bank, it shares many strategic objectives with a CBDC: providing a secure, efficient, and sovereign digital payment rail. This initiative could serve as a testing ground for broader digital ruble adoption or even complement a future official CBDC. The goal is clear: to enhance financial independence and create resilient payment systems that can operate effectively regardless of external pressures. This move by Rostec, a key player in Russia’s defense and industrial sectors, signals a high-level strategic endorsement of blockchain technology for national economic interests. It represents a proactive step to adapt to a rapidly evolving global financial landscape where digital assets are becoming increasingly central. The Promise and Peril: Benefits and Challenges of Rostec’s Initiative Every innovative leap comes with its own set of promises and perils. Rostec’s venture into the RUBx stablecoin and RT-Pay platform holds immense potential benefits for Russia’s economy, but it also faces significant challenges that will determine its ultimate success. Understanding both sides of the coin is crucial for a balanced perspective. Potential Benefits: Economic Efficiency: Streamlined transactions, reduced settlement times, and lower operational costs across various sectors. Enhanced Security: Blockchain technology offers inherent security features, reducing fraud and increasing transparency for digital payments. Innovation Catalyst: The platform’s support for smart contracts could foster new business models and innovative financial products within Russia. Financial Sovereignty: Less reliance on traditional international payment systems, offering greater control over domestic and cross-border transactions. Improved Accessibility: Providing digital payment solutions to unbanked or underbanked populations, fostering greater financial inclusion. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets, ensuring full compliance while fostering innovation. Public Adoption: Overcoming inertia and building trust among the general populace and businesses to encourage widespread use of a new digital payment system. Cybersecurity Risks: Despite blockchain’s inherent security, any large-scale digital platform remains a target for sophisticated cyberattacks, requiring continuous vigilance. Technological Scalability: Ensuring the Tron blockchain and RT-Pay platform can handle the immense transaction volume required for a national payment system. Interoperability: Ensuring seamless interaction with existing financial systems and potentially with other national or international digital currencies. The success of this initiative will heavily depend on Rostec’s ability to address these challenges effectively, building a robust, secure, and user-friendly system that instills confidence and delivers tangible benefits to the Russian economy. Looking Ahead to 2025: The Impact of RUBx and RT-Pay The year 2025 marks a pivotal moment for Russia’s digital currency aspirations with the anticipated launch of RUBx and RT-Pay. This timeline suggests a carefully planned rollout, allowing for rigorous testing, regulatory alignment, and public education. The impact of such a system could be far-reaching, transforming various facets of the Russian economy. For instance, in the realm of B2B payments, smart contracts on RT-Pay could automate supply chain financing, significantly reducing administrative overhead and payment delays. For consumers, the integration with external wallets means more flexible and potentially cheaper ways to send and receive money, pay for goods and services, and manage personal finances digitally. Furthermore, the initiative could position Russia as a leader in leveraging blockchain technology for state-backed financial instruments, potentially influencing other nations considering similar moves. The collaboration between a defense industry giant like Rostec and the financial sector highlights a convergence of strategic national interests with technological innovation. While the primary focus appears to be domestic economic enhancement and resilience, the long-term implications for international trade, particularly with countries in the BRICS bloc and beyond, cannot be overlooked. A successful RUBx and RT-Pay could lay the groundwork for a more diversified and independent global financial architecture, driven by digital assets. Conclusion: Paving the Way for a Digital Tomorrow Rostec’s announcement of the RUBx stablecoin and RT-Pay platform represents a significant stride in Russia’s journey towards a more digitized and resilient financial future. By leveraging the efficient Tron blockchain and integrating with existing banking infrastructure, this initiative aims to create a secure, compliant, and innovative payment ecosystem. While challenges such as regulatory complexities and public adoption remain, the strategic imperative for enhanced financial sovereignty and efficiency is clear. As 2025 approaches, the world will be watching closely to see how this ambitious project unfolds and reshapes the landscape of Russia’s digital currency and beyond. This bold move by Rostec could indeed be a blueprint for how state-backed entities embrace blockchain, signaling a new era for national digital economies.

According to ZachXBT’s statement on his personal channel, C&M Software, one of the service providers of the Brazilian Central Bank, was the target of a massive cyberattack worth approximately $140 million (800 million reais). The incident occurred on June 30, 2025, when six different financial institutions gained unauthorized access to their reserve accounts at the Central Bank. The attackers converted the fiat money they obtained from these accounts into digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Tether (USDT) via over-the-counter (OTC) markets and cryptocurrency exchanges in Latin America. According to ZachXBT, at least $30 million to $40 million was converted into cryptocurrencies. Related News: Major Update News Arrives for Altcoin Whose Price Has Plummeted Over the Past Year What’s even more striking is that the attackers purchased the company’s login information from one of C&M Software’s employees for just 15,000 reais (about $2,760). According to information from Brazilian security services, this simple access created a gap worth millions of dollars. ZachXBT stated that it has been tracking funds, helping to freeze some accounts, and trying to identify OTC brokers who are conducting illegal transactions. It also stated that the wallet addresses related to the incident will be shared with the public at the appropriate time. However, it was also noted that despite this serious security breach, the incident received almost no media coverage outside of Brazil. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T20:17:25,"Sweden’s crypto crackdown: police told to seize digital assets ‘without proof of crime’","Sweden’s Justice Minister has reportedly ordered law enforcement to ramp up seizures of unexplained crypto holdings—even without direct evidence of a crime. The directive hinges on a controversial law that could redefine asset forfeiture in the digital age. On July 4, Decrypt reported that Sweden’s Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer issued a formal call for law enforcement, tax authorities, and the national Enforcement Authority to intensify confiscations of crypto assets suspected of being tied to illicit activity. The directive is based on a law passed last November that grants authorities sweeping powers to seize digital assets, even without definitive proof of criminal conduct, if the owners cannot adequately explain their origins. Since its introduction, the law has already been used to seize $8.4 million in property, marking one of Europe’s most aggressive stances on unexplained wealth. According to the report, Strömmer emphasized the importance of improving inter-agency coordination, particularly when dealing with high-value assets like cryptocurrency, stating it was “time to turn up the pressure.” You might also like: Ondo Finance to acquire SEC-regulated broker-dealer Oasis Pro Why Sweden is targeting crypto with aggressive seizure powers Justice Minister Strömmer’s push appears to stem from mounting concern over digital assets’ role in Sweden’s organized crime economy. A September 2024 report from Sweden’s Police Authority and Financial Intelligence Unit found that some cryptocurrency exchanges function as de facto money laundering services—facilitating the flow of drug money, fraud proceeds, and other criminal revenue. The report explicitly urged law enforcement to “increase its presence” on crypto trading platforms to help identify and dismantle such operations. Meanwhile, recent figures from the Bloomsbury Intelligence & Security Institute estimate that roughly 62,000 individuals were involved in or linked to criminal networks in Sweden as of 2024. While data on crypto-specific crime remains sparse, authorities cite the anonymity and cross-border capabilities of digital assets as key enablers of organized crime. These concerns likely fueled Strömmer’s argument that Sweden’s asset forfeiture laws must evolve to match the realities of financial crime in the digital era. One of the most vocal supporters of Strömmer’s crackdown is Sweden Democrat Dennis Dioukarev, a prominent advocate for a national Bitcoin reserve. Dioukarev argues that seized crypto, particularly Bitcoin ( BTC ), should be transferred to Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, to build a strategic reserve. “Cryptocurrencies confiscated from criminals should be repurposed to strengthen Sweden’s financial position,” Dioukarev said in the report, framing the move as a way to turn crime-fighting into a long-term economic asset. Still, the government’s silence on what will actually happen to confiscated crypto has raised questions. When pressed, Strömmer’s office declined to clarify whether seized assets would be liquidated, held, or directed into a national reserve.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $8.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare

A judge has granted preliminary approval for a settlement that will hand $177 million to people affected by the breaches. The first breach is believed to have happened back in 2019, with hackers stealing sensitive data from 7.6 million current and 65.4 million former customers. Although AT&T believes the data may have been taken from one of its vendors, the firm has acknowledged that data including customers’ social security numbers, names and dates of birth was exposed. The second breach happened last year, when hackers breached the company’s Snowflake cloud workspace environment, stealing smartphone call and text metadata of nearly 110 million customers from May of 2022 to October of 2022. People who can prove they suffered financial damages as a result of the data breaches will likely receive a larger share of the payout. At time of publishing, affected customers are expected to receive notice of eligibility by mail or email, with the claims process coming in August.

2025-07-04T20:00:53,"US Gov Could Mine Bitcoin Through Public-Private Deal, Says White House Exec","Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisors on Digital Assets, signalled that Washington is seriously considering a public-private partnership with US miners to expand the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve—without spending new federal dollars. Speaking with Marathon Digital Holdings chief executive Fred Thiel, Hines said that “a public-private partnership between the miners could be a phenomenal way to accumulate Bitcoin for the reserve” adding that the working group is “look[ing] forward to being part of that. White House Considers Partnering With Bitcoin Miners Created by Executive Order 14233 on 6 March 2025, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve directs the Treasury to amass BTC through budget-neutral means—principally by sweeping forfeited digital assets and deploying “creative solutions” to acquire more. Hines said the inter-agency working group set up under that order is now examining mechanisms that would let industrial miners route a portion of fresh block rewards directly to Treasury custodial wallets, potentially in exchange for long-term power-purchase contracts or accelerated permitting. “We’ll work with Commerce, we’ll work with Treasury Secretary Bessent to find these creative solutions,” he told Thiel. “A public-private partnership between the miners could be a phenomenal way to accumulate Bitcoin for the reserve.” Thiel, whose company operates one of the world’s largest fleets of ASIC rigs, noted that such a scheme would simultaneously increase US on-shore hash-rate and give the government a predictable pipeline of newly mined BTC. “One of the great opportunities—especially that solves two issues—helps the government accumulate Bitcoin and helps Bitcoin miners establish more hash rate in the US—is to partner with the US government,” he said. Hines agreed, replying, “Absolutely. We certainly look forward to being part of that.” The conversation also centred on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act , which cleared the Senate Banking Committee lately with rare bipartisan support and is queued for a floor vote. Hines called the bill “really monumental,” emphasising that instant-settling, dollar-backed stablecoins would modernise payments and “secure our global dominance for decades to come.” He predicted that regulated stables could propel total digital-asset market capitalisation to “15–20 trillion dollars” and channel new liquidity into Bitcoin once market participants can “move in and out of different asset classes at will.” Pressed by Thiel on how large the reserve should ultimately be, Hines dismissed the question as “silly,” reiterating that officials would pursue every legal avenue to expand holdings : “We want as much Bitcoin as we can possibly accumulate.” Notably, the Executive Order laid down an aggressive schedule: by April 5, 2025 (30 days after signature) every federal agency was to file both a legal-authority review and a full on-chain accounting of whatever Bitcoin or other digital assets it held; by May 5, 2025 (60 days) the Treasury Secretary had to deliver a legal-and-investment evaluation for managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. None of the documents has been released. When asked about the silence, Bo Hines said last week that “there’s nothing in the order that mandates that the report becomes public,” but added the administration “could choose to make it public at some point.” At press time, BTC traded at $109,034.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/us-mine-bitcoin-public-private-deal/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T20:00:27,"Bitcoin Investors Hoarding $1,200,000,000,000 in Unrealized Profits, According to Glassnode – Here’s What It Means","Investors have accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized profits on Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the crypto king hovers just below the all-time high, according to analytics platform Glassnode. The analytics platform says Bitcoin investors are sitting on $1.2 trillion in unrealized profits as “HODLing remains the dominant behavior.” “Despite this surge in profitability, investor behavior signals a strong preference for HODLing, as the current price range appears insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking. This is reflected in declining realized profits, a continued downtrend in Liveliness, and Long-Term Holder supply climbing to a new all-time high.” Liveliness is an on-chain indicator that is used to determine the holding behavior, with a decrease suggesting Bitcoin is being held for longer periods and vice versa. The Long-Term Holder supply metric is used to categorize the total circulating supply based on how long the coins have been held – an increase in the supply suggests coins are being held for lengthy periods. According to the analytics platform, the $1.2 trillion in unrealized profits that Bitcoin investors are sitting on could provide an “incentive for potential sell-side pressure” if sentiment shifts or if the crypto king moves out of the present price range. “Despite this surge in profitability, investor behavior signals a strong preference for HODLing, as the current price range appears insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking.” Compared to other recent periods when Bitcoin broke above the previous all-time high prices, Glassnode says the profits Bitcoin investors are booking are at relatively lower levels. “Around $872 million worth of is currently being locked in profit per day, which is notably less that the $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion in realized profit seen during the $73,000 and $107,000 all-time high formations, respectively.” Bitcoin is trading at $109,422 at time of writing.

2025-07-04T20:00:01,"Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline","Bitcoin has been gaining strength over the past several days, with price action relaying the buying interest from institutional players. A surge of inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs helped push the price to $109,758, followed shortly after by another move to around $110,386 in the past 24 hours. This brings Bitcoin within close proximity to its price peak just above $111,000. Now that momentum is clearly leaning bullish, technical analysis shows a breakout that could see Bitcoin increase by another 52% within the next three months. Fibonacci Extension Model Points To $166,000 Price Target CryptoCon shared a chart based on Fibonacci extensions that places the next major upside target at $166,754. This level corresponds to the 5.618 Fibonacci ratio and marks a projected 52% increase from the current region around $109,000. The analyst highlighted how previous Fibonacci extension levels like $30,362, $46,831, $71,591, and $109,236, have all aligned with important points for Bitcoin’s price action throughout the ongoing cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes History With Highest Monthly Close, But Volume Is Still Bearish According to CryptoCon, this model has consistently tracked Bitcoin’s moves over the past two years. As shown in the price chart below, the 1.618, 2.618, 3.618, and 4.618 Fibonacci extension levels have all been reached this cycle, with the latest being $109,236 at the 4.618 Fib level. Keeping this in mind, the next Fibonacci extension level is at 5.618, which corresponds to $166,754. The $166,000 mark has remained unchanged as the cycle’s next projection. But although the timing has proven difficult to nail down, the structure of the chart is still intact and continues to validate the target. Bitcoin’s price action is currently sitting just above the 4.618 extension level, and a 52% rally from here would complete the pattern. Revised Timeline Pushes Target To September Although the projection for $166,000 is still consistent, the timeline to reach it has undergone several adjustments. CryptoCon estimates that Bitcoin could reach the $166,000 level by September; however, he also acknowledged that the forecast has shifted several times. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move He explained that the current cycle has taken longer than any previous one, which has caused earlier predictions to be delayed. To put this in perspective, Bitcoin’s current cycle began in late 2022 after it reached a bottom around $15,000 during the bear market. This means the current bull phase has dragged on for almost three years. Still, data has shown over and over that the cycle is not finished, and so the only thing left to do is to wait. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,110. If the $160,000 price target is eventually reached in September, the next outlook would be a possible move to the 6.618 Fib extension, which is sitting at a price target of $254,162.

2025-07-04T19:55:05,"Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen Issues Altcoin Alert, Says Alts Primed To Keep Going Lower Against Bitcoin – Here’s Why","A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst is issuing an alert, warning traders that altcoins appear poised to continue declining against Bitcoin ( BTC ). In a new thread, crypto trader Benjamin Cowen tells his 1 million followers on the social media platform X that US monetary policy will remain tight, suggesting that altcoin pairs versus the top crypto asset by market cap are heading to their range lows. “With the economy holding strong, it delays rate cuts and likely delays the end to QT [quantitative tightening]. This suggests that monetary policy will remain restrictive, continuing to support the idea that altcoin/BTC pairs are likely still heading to the range lows.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/X According to Cohen, during the last two summers, altcoin pairs versus BTC would rally before dipping during Q4, a move he believes could happen again. “The last 2 summers ALT/BTC pairs found some brief relief before heading lower into Q4. The larger bounce by ALT/BTC pairs over the last few years did not occur until November.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/X TOTAL3, or the entire market cap of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ), is sitting at $827.5 billion at time of writing, a 2.3% decrease on the day. Cowen concludes his analysis by telling traders not to confuse ALT/BTC pairs with USD/BTC pairs, which behave in different ways. “Does anyone understand the difference between ALT/BTC and ALT/USD or are people just going to keep pretending they are the same thing? This is the difference between ALT/USD and ALT/BTC pairs. ALTs keep bleeding to BTC but have gone up on their USD pairs.

The Humanity ( H ) token gained as most altcoins dipped amid Bitcoin ( BTC )’s slip from highs of $110k on Friday. Losses for BTC came amid a massive 80,000 Bitcoin transfer by wallets that had stayed dormant for over 14 years, and saw Ethereum, XRP and Solana among other top digital assets retreat to support levels. However, Humanity’s native token defied the downturn as its price surged from lows of $0.072 to above $0.108. The daily gains, accompanied by a 74% spike in trading volume to over $481 million, extended the cryptocurrency’s weekly rally to over 400%.

2025-07-04T19:52:39,"Dormant Bitcoin Whales Move $2B After 14 Years","Two of the all-time great Bitcoin whale wallets, which had lain dormant since 2011, have mysteriously come back to life and shifted a combined 20,000 BTC—over $2 billion at today's prices—out of them to brand-new addresses. The cinematic resurrection of these Satoshi-era wallets has once again sparked controversy about Bitcoin's real circulating supply, the destiny of lost coins, and the possibility of fresh volatility as the market teeters at all-time highs. Following the Whale Transactions The two wallets, both of which were opened back in April 2011 when Bitcoin traded for just $0.78, each moved 10,000 BTC on 4th July 2025. The moves were first pointed out by Blockchain analysts at Whale Alert and Lookonchain before other on-chain data accelerated verification. The BTC, now worth over $1 billion per wallet, had remained completely dormant through three bear markets, the collapse of Mt. Gox, and Bitcoin's run to over $110,000. Most significantly, the coins were not being deposited onto exchanges, but into other fresh addresses, causing speculators to suspect the owner may be upscaling wallet security or preparing for future transactions rather than selling. This intel has fueled gossip on social media outlets, with some speculating the wallets could be owned by Satoshi Nakamoto or other early Bitcoin influencers, while others suggest possible links to Silk Road or recently pardoned individuals. Market Volatility and Impact Signals Historically, the re-appearance of long-dormant Bitcoin addresses—specifically ones of such magnitude—has been a signal for market volatility. While these particular transactions have yet to mean pressure in the form of selling (since the coins did not move to exchanges), the psychological impact to the market is enormous. Traders and experts look closely at such whale activity as potential indicators of supply shocks or price volatility. Real-time on-chain analysis presents the information that while some of these vintage whales have sold during 2025's rally, there are still most coins in such Satoshi-era wallets remaining off exchanges, limiting near-term risk of downside. CryptoQuant data presents the news that the exchange whale ratio has actually fallen, meaning fewer whales selling out and a more ”natural” market environment. Even then, the mere possibility of these coins surfacing on the market at some point is sufficient to keep traders on their toes. What Previous Whale Reactivations Mean for Bitcoin In the past, whale reactivations on a large scale have happened during periods of heightened volatility and, at times, local market tops. However, not all dormant wallet movements translate into a sell-off. Whales sometimes simply upgrade security, roll coins into new custody solutions, or set up for inheritance and estate planning. Recent movements, to non-exchange addresses, suggest no immediate seller intent, but they also re-raise the question of how much Bitcoin supply is truly ”lost” vs simply dormant. On-chain data also shows that the percentage of long-term holders' Bitcoin supply is near all-time highs despite some of the older coins moving. Such action is double-edged: it can prop up prices by reducing circulating supply, yet impulsive whale movement can quickly change sentiment.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9814/dormant-bitcoin-whales-move-2-b-after-14-years,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T19:46:49,"President Putin blames energy deficits for the creeping ban on crypto mining across Russia","President Putin of Russia has blamed growing energy deficits caused by the booming minting of digital currencies for a creeping ban on crypto mining across his country. Putin’s comments on the matter follow a recent increase in electricity prices which, as analysts predict, is likely to affect the business of companies mining Bitcoin in the Russian Federation. Governors asked for it, Putin says of Russian mining ban Electricity shortages resulting from the rapid growth of crypto mining are the main reason for Moscow’s decision to ban the activity in certain regions, Russian President Vladimir Putin explained during an event devoted to discussing development initiatives. Local officials dealing with the issue have been urging the federal government to do something as they are facing insufficient energy supplies needed for various infrastructure and industry projects, Russia’s head of state revealed, quoted by the Kremlin. Speaking about the need to maintain a balanced approach to exploiting Russia’s resources during the plenary session of the “Strong Ideas for a New Time” forum, organized by the Agency for Strategic Initiatives, Putin gave crypto mining as an example: “We were recently happy we had a surplus of electricity in some regions. But they began actively mining there, and governors started complaining to me they did not have enough electricity to develop their regions. We were forced to make certain decisions in the mining sphere.” The concerns of local authorities highlighted by the Russian leader have so far led to seasonal or permanent restrictions on cryptocurrency mining in many corners of the vast country. A full ban , until 2031, has been imposed in almost a dozen territories, from Siberia to the North Caucasus and occupied Ukraine, although some regions were recently spared with federal officials warning that tax and energy revenues may take a hit. Higher electricity rates also hurt Russian miners Meanwhile, electricity costs in Russia have gone up since July 1. According to a report by the business news portal RBC, tariffs for power transmission via Russia’s national grid will increase by 11.5% by the end of 2025 and the rates charged by local distributors will jump by 11.6%. Electricity is arguably the biggest expense for mining enterprises as their hardware consumes significant amounts of electric energy. The latest generation device can burn about 2.5 MW a month, and industrial-size minting facilities have thousands of these mining machines constantly running. While most mining firms take into account the usual annual indexation of energy prices in advance, this year’s increase is outstripping inflation and threatens to reduce the competitiveness of Russia’s mining sector as a whole, according to Oleg Ogienko, expert on blockchain, energy, and digital finance. The analyst remarked that both customers of Russian mining companies and investors, especially foreign investors, are already choosing other, more favorable jurisdictions, such as the United States, where, in his words, a real mining boom is currently taking place. Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining with a law signed by Vladimir Putin in August 2024. Under the legislation, legal entities and private individuals are allowed to mint digital coins as long as they register with the Federal Tax Service and pay their due taxes. Only about 30% have done so . Low electricity rates and, in some cases, a surplus of generating capacities, turned places like the Siberian Oblast of Irkutsk into mining hotspots over the past few years. Then, the resulting power deficits were met with government prohibitions. Industry watchers claim, however, that the restrictive measures are mostly hurting legal mining businesses. To address the issue, Russian authorities are considering alternative options such as moving crypto farms to energy-rich regions, in the North, for example, while cracking down on illegal mining activities throughout the country, and more specifically in energy-deficient regions.

2025-07-04T19:45:00,"Bitcoin community abuzz as 14-year-dormant wallets move $2 billion","The bitcoin world lit up on Friday after two wallets holding a combined 20,000 BTC — untouched since 2011 — suddenly came to life, sparking speculation, awe, and some market caution. Blockchain trackers Whale Alert and Lookonchain were the first to flag the transfers, noting that each wallet contained 10,000 BTC. When the coins were initially acquired, bitcoin traded at just $0.78. At current levels near $108,868, each wallet now holds more than $1.09 billion — a staggering unrealized gain of over 139,000%. The activation of long-dormant wallets has become a rare but closely watched event in the crypto space, given the potential for large-scale sell-offs and their market impact. A rising trend of old bitcoin awakening Data from blockchain analytics firm Onchain School shows that the movement of older bitcoin is not just a one-off phenomenon this year. According to the group, 62,800 BTC that had remained unmoved for more than seven years was activated between January and March 2025. That marks a 121% increase from the 28,000 BTC moved during the same period in 2024. The reason for this uptick remains uncertain, though analysts point to the sharp rise in bitcoin’s value and the surge in institutional interest following the launch of US-regulated spot bitcoin ETFs as possible drivers. Bitcoin’s price has climbed 16% so far this year and set a new record above $110,000 in May. Still, the mystery surrounding the identities and intentions of the dormant wallet holders remains intact. There has been no indication that the recent transfers are part of a planned sale. HODLers or sellers? The market watches closely Caroline Bowler, CEO of Melbourne-based BTC Markets, said the action is consistent with early bitcoin adopters who embraced a “HODL” — hold on for dear life — strategy during the volatile early years of crypto. “What is remarkable is the amount of self-control that it would have taken through all these market cycles to sit on it for that long,” Bowler told MarketWatch . Bowler noted that if the owners do intend to sell, doing so in a single trade could destabilize the market. However, she expects that any sales would likely occur through over-the-counter (OTC) channels, spread out over time to minimize market disruption. Bowler said there are a number of “dormant wallets out there with significant holdings of bitcoin that are unlikely to ever be activated because people have lost the access to it. And that’s what makes it particularly of interest within the bitcoin community when you see one of these things like back up again.” Speculation builds amid bullish long-term forecasts For now, the wallet holders appear to remain long-term believers in bitcoin’s potential. But with BTC sitting at all-time highs and high-profile forecasts making the rounds, many are watching for signs of a shift. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently reiterated his bullish stance, forecasting that bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2025 in a best-case scenario. His base case remains at $150,000. Lee said in an interview last month that with “95% of the world still not owning bitcoin,” the supply-demand imbalance leaves significant upside. The sudden reawakening of long-dormant whales could signal rising conviction, nervousness, or just a quiet reshuffling. Either way, in a market as sentiment-sensitive as crypto, the ripples are being felt far and wide.

Here Are the Details","NIP Group, the umbrella company of the world-famous e-sports organization Ninjas in Pyjamas (NiP), announced that it has entered the Bitcoin mining industry. Esports Giant Ninjas in Pyjamas Gets Into Bitcoin Mining: Aims to Produce $6.5 Million in BTC Monthly The company aims to produce 60 BTC per month by purchasing a series of mining rigs with a total computational power of 3.11 EH/s (exahash/second), which corresponds to a production value of approximately $6.5 million at current prices. However, this production represents gross income; net income may differ once expenses such as electricity and operating costs are deducted. NIP Group has established a new unit to manage mining operations and make strategic decisions regarding the BTCs mined: Digital Computing Division. Although the company has not yet given details on how it will evaluate Bitcoins, this new division will also take responsibility for future mining investments. “We Are Not Just a Gaming Company Anymore” NIP Group co-founder and co-CEO Hicham Chahine said in a statement on LinkedIn that after the company went public last year, they wanted to create revenue models in areas other than esports and entertainment. Chahine emphasized that Bitcoin mining stands out as a “related and innovative” area and that they will continue to expand in this area. “We are no longer just a gaming company. We are transforming into a digital infrastructure company fit for the entertainment era,” Chahine said, noting that they are investing in real computing power and operational capacity. But investors don’t seem to have welcomed the decision so far. The company’s shares have fallen 17% since the announcement on Tuesday, falling to $2.13. They have fallen 88% since their peak of $17.76 in July 2024. NIP Group’s move sees institutional firms joining the trend of building bitcoin reserves, much like MicroStrategy’s pioneering model. Led by MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, the model has led to a 3,300% increase in the company’s stock, turning it into a major crypto asset investor. However, experts remind that this approach carries risks due to high volatility and that companies may have to sell BTC if they are in trouble. NIP Group's new direction shows that gaming giants are now trying to grow not only through content production, but also through digital infrastructure and asset management. *This is not investment advice.

It has revealed its intention to introduce its RUBx stablecoin alongside RT-Pay, a specialized platform designed for cryptocurrency-based transactions. The RUBx token, which maintains a 1:1 peg to the Russian ruble , will function on the TRON blockchain network. In a July 3 company statement , Rostec indicated that both the stablecoin and RT-Pay platforms would function as secure payment mechanisms for commercial entities and retail users. Russia’s state-owned conglomerate Rostec plans to launch a fiat-backed stablecoin called RUBx later this year, built on the Tron blockchain. RUBx will be pegged 1:1 to the Russian ruble and aims to drive ruble digitization through the RT‑Pay payment platform.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 4, 2025 Why the RUBx Stablecoin Could ‘Kill SWIFT’ for Russian Payments Despite US Sanctions Rostec asserts that the platform operates in full compliance with Russian regulatory frameworks, including Central Bank requirements and anti-money laundering protocols designed to prevent terrorist financing. “ Each RUBx token is supported by genuine ruble-denominated obligations. This backing is legally secured. The token maintains a one-to-one ratio with the actual ruble. We plan to launch the system within this year, with Rostec acting as the primary operator ,” stated Rostec Deputy General Director Alexander Nazarov. Rostec has operated under comprehensive US sanctions since June 2022, implemented following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine. These restrictions, enforced by multiple nations, including the United States and European Union, target Rostec’s subsidiary companies and affiliated entities. The sanctions seek to limit Russia’s military production capacity and its capabilities in weapons manufacturing. Industry observers have characterized the RUBx stablecoin initiative as Russia’s strategic attempt to circumvent SWIFT , the international financial messaging system supervised by G-10 central banks, including the United States. This interpretation gains credibility given that Russia’s Central Bank has explicitly stated in recent years that its primary objective in developing a digital ruble is to provide Russian corporations and financial institutions with “independence from SWIFT.” Russia’s ‘Crypto Shift’: State-owned Firms Use Blockchain To Beat Dollar Dominance Regarding the forthcoming RUBx stablecoin, Rostec confirmed that the RT-Pay platform will integrate with existing banking infrastructure, allowing digital payment processing and interaction with external cryptocurrency wallets and smart contracts. The RUBx token, built on Justin Sun’s TRON blockchain , will have its source code made publicly available on GitHub and undergo verification and security auditing by CertiK, an independent international blockchain security firm. Russia also appears to be increasingly embracing cryptocurrency as a method to circumvent international sanctions. Recently, the Russian Agricultural Bank (RusAg) announced it is collaborating with the Bank of Russia to assess digital asset-based payment solutions for grain export transactions. Russia is exploring ways to use cryptocurrencies to settle grain export payments, as the country looks to bypass Western sanctions. #Russia #Crypto https://t.co/zCSTnCTLEJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 Irina Zhachkina, RusAg’s First Deputy CEO, characterized cryptocurrencies as a “ practical alternative instrument ” for international payments, particularly as sanctions continue restricting Russia’s access to conventional financial systems. Russian grain exporters are facing mounting pressure from restrictions that affect logistics, shipping insurance, and access to the SWIFT banking network. These constraints have increasingly complicated Russian companies’ ability to conduct transactions in US dollars or euros. Both the RUBx stablecoin initiative and grain settlement mechanisms build upon Russia’s previous experience utilizing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) for oil trade settlements with China and India . China and Russia are reportedly using Bitcoin to settle energy trades, marking a significant shift in global trade dynamics and de-dollarization. #Bitcoin #Energy https://t.co/UVJDN4rZSv — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 10, 2025 State-owned enterprises are also simultaneously developing proprietary blockchain services. For example, in March, Gazprom, Russia’s majority-state-owned energy giant, launched a series of tradable blockchain-powered “digital financial assets” (DFAs) . Similarly, Rostelecom, Russia’s largest telecommunications and digital services provider, issued two proprietary DFAs on the Moscow Exchange earlier that month. Additionally, Russia appears to be leveraging cryptocurrency and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) as countermeasures against international sanctions. In May, Russian media outlet RBC reported that the central bank had established regulatory guidelines governing the use of cryptocurrency by Russian firms in international trade agreements. These regulations specify that digital currencies “must not be associated with securities issued by hostile issuers” and emphasize the necessity of engaging with projects that maintain a presence in “friendly countries.” The post Sanctioned Russian Giant Rostec Bypasses Banks with Tron-Based RUBx Stablecoin appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/sanctioned-russian-giant-rostec-bypasses-banks-with-tron-based-rubx-stablecoin/,"BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|BTC|ASIA|ETH","Blockchain News|News|Russia|Stablecoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T19:12:33,"4 Coins Set to Rise 5,000% if Bitcoin Hits $170,000 and Ethereum Reaches $8,000 in the Coming Crypto Bull Run","We’re in the eye of the storm. Bitcoin is stabilizing above $62K, Ethereum’s holding $3,400, and traders across X (formerly Twitter), Discord, and Telegram can feel it: the next macro leg up isn’t just possible—it’s approaching. If BTC touches $170,000 and ETH crosses $8,000—targets floated by multiple institutional desks—the meme coin market won’t just move. It’ll erupt. And in this next run, it won’t be the usual suspects leading the charge. We’re watching four meme coins that have the potential to increase by 5,000% or more—not because of nostalgia, but because of their narrative positioning, technical structure, and raw community momentum. First up? A Layer-2 frog with real teeth. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – The Infrastructure Meme Built to Moon You’ve seen meme coins ride hype waves. You’ve seen them vanish just as fast. But LILPEPE is different—it’s engineered to ride the wave and still be standing when the tide rolls back. At its core is a Layer-2 blockchain, not just a token. Built for zero-tax swaps, staking utility, and meme-native project launches, LILPEPE isn’t trying to follow PEPE or Dogecoin—it’s surpassing them through infrastructure. The market is responding. Currently in Stage 4 of its presale, LILPEPE has already sold 2.57 billion tokens, raising $3,037,695—68.01% complete with a soft cap of $4.475 million. Token price? Just $0.0013, with a guaranteed listing at $0.003, meaning early buyers lock in an immediate 2.3x ROI. But that’s the floor. Analysts are floating $0.05, $0.10, even $1 if listings and narrative tailwinds align. And they just might. A $777,000 giveaway campaign is pouring gasoline on the fire, rewarding early holders, creators, and community promoters. Social chatter is spiking, and meme coin influencers are piling in—not just for fun, but for function. LILPEPE is staking, launching, and scaling before it even hits the open market. In a bull run defined by narratives, utility-infused memes will outperform legacy tokens. LILPEPE is the most technically capable meme coin in presale today—and the one most likely to 50x before Bitcoin hits $170K. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) – Viral Animal Meme Coin Peanut (PNUT) is a 2024 meme coin born from a heart-wrenching viral story. It honors a rescued pet squirrel (“Peanut”) whose plight drew worldwide attention (even Elon Musk tweeted about it). After its launch, PNUT soared to a $1+ billion market cap in days and won a Binance listing. The coin’s community grew overnight, united by a cause and a whimsical mascot. Unlike dog-themed tokens, Peanut stands out as a protest symbol and charity coin (partnering with animal organizations). This unique narrative has kept its momentum alive beyond a typical pump. In late 2024 and 2025, PNUT benefited from crypto bull runs; it jumped quickly on market upswings due to hype. Going into Q3 2025, Peanut’s volatility is very high – it can 10x or more in short bursts – because it’s still seen as a tokenization of a viral meme more than a project. However, its Binance listing and cause-driven branding give it more substance than most new memecoins. For investors looking for the next viral hit, PNUT’s story and engagement make it a top meme pick to follow. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) – NFT-Driven Meme PENGU is the native token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT project, launched in 2023. Unlike dog or frog memes, its mascot is a cartoon penguin, and it has one of the strongest crypto communities (millions of NFT fans). The token’s market cap is relatively modest (under $100 million), but it often trends in line with NFT and meme markets. Analysts note that even after some pullbacks, PENGU still ranks as a top meme token by social buzz, backed by its large NFT community. The project plans to develop play-to-earn games and has established partnerships (e.g., NASCAR), aiming to expand its ecosystem. In Q3 2025, PENGU’s upside depends on NFT and play‑to‑earn trends: it could rally strongly if those sectors heat up. Even without big headlines, the token tends to react to overall market movements (when the crypto market rises, Pudgy often follows). Its community’s focus on fun and collectibility gives it a different flavor among memes. In summary, Pudgy Penguins’ token is a niche play: high-risk but with upside if meme and NFT mania return. Memecoin (MEME) – 9GAG’s Viral Token Memecoin ($MEME) was created by the team behind the popular meme site 9GAG (sold on launch to early investors in Oct 2023). It’s 100% memes – no roadmap or utility – but it has a strong social angle. As of mid-2025, $MEME trades at a few cents, with approximately 7.5 billion tokens in circulation (market cap: around $260 million). It briefly surged to $0.04 on hype news. The coin’s community is tied to the 9GAG brand (millions of followers) and tends to buy on meme speculation alone. For Q3 2025, MEME is purely speculative; it can surge in a frenzy or crash just as quickly. However, its backing by a known platform means it will remain on the radar of hype-driven investors. Traders may watch MEME for quick momentum plays when the market is frothy. In short, MEME represents the ultimate viral gamble – if meme culture booms, it could explode; if not, it may underperform. Final Word: You Don’t Wait for 5,000% Gains—You Front-Run Them LILPEPE is still in presale. PNUT is undervalued in a sleepy zone. PENGU is waiting for NFTs to heat up. MEME is hovering like a loaded spring. If Bitcoin and Ethereum punch through all-time highs this year, these four tokens won’t just rise—they’ll explode. But by the time headlines catch on, it’ll be too late. So look closely now. Because the market’s whispering, and these coins are already leaning into the mic.

2025-07-04T19:06:02,"Hackers allegedly bribed a C&M employee to steal $140 million from six banks in one day","In a bold cyber heist on June 30, an estimated $140 million (R$800 million) was stolen from six Brazilian financial institutions’ reserve accounts through a sophisticated cyberattack targeting C&M Software, a key service provider that connects banks to the Central Bank of Brazil and its PIX system. At least $30 to $40 million of the stolen funds have since been laundered into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether’s USDT via Latin American over-the-counter (OTC) desks and exchanges, according to on‑chain investigator ZachXBT . The Central Bank of Brazil heist started as an internal compromise The hackers reportedly paid a C&M Software employee just R$15,000 (~$2,760) in exchange for corporate login credentials. Armed with those, they deployed social engineering techniques to access the central bank service infrastructure. This allowed them to siphon funds from the reserve accounts of six institutions, including Banco BMF and others, within the same day. Upon discovery, the Central Bank of Brazil swiftly instructed C&M to sever its connections, effectively isolating the provider from banking systems. The breach led to the temporary suspension of PIX-related services while authorities and internal teams rallied to restore security and prevent wider contagion. The hack closely follows the pattern of the recent attack on the crypto exchange Coinbase, where customer service agents took bribes to reveal customer information. This led to the breach of over 69,000 accounts, with Coinbase expected to reimburse as high as $400 million to customers. On-chain sleuth follows the crypto laundering trail ZachXBT, a leading figure in blockchain forensics, reported he has been actively collaborating with Brazilian law enforcement to track stolen funds and prevent further laundering on-chain. Public statements from ZachXBT indicate he plans to release the addresses linked to the theft “when it’s okay to share them,” to aid authorities in freezing additional crypto assets. Brazilian federal investigators have arrested at least one suspect: the C&M employee whose credentials were sold. Authorities have already frozen approximately R$270 million, approximately $55 million in compromised funds. The Central Bank of Brazil also claims to have reinforced monitoring systems to better detect irregular PIX-related transactions. Security analysts warn that the attention-grabbing $140 million figure distracts from the larger threat of social engineering. This tactic consistently tops the list of vulnerabilities in the financial sector. Despite technical firewalls and hardened systems, insiders with stolen credentials can render them moot. The response has moved on to damage control and reputational repair The attack mirrors recent trends in crypto crime and how proceeds from crimes that didn’t happen on-chain are also funneled into crypto. In the first half of 2025 alone, industry watchdog CertiK estimated losses from hacks and scams at a staggering $2.5 billion, with most of the incidents happening on the Ethereum network, followed by Bitcoin. The report also showed that wallet compromise and phishing are the leading tools hackers employ for their heists. Although they have both shared press releases acknowledging the hack and pointing out that investigations are ongoing, neither C&M nor the Central Bank of Brazil has released a detailed public breakdown of the damage. The Central Bank of Brazil has not revealed the details of the financial institutions affected by the hack. However, insiders reveal ongoing operations to mitigate reputational and customer impact, primarily through customer account security assurances and increased transaction verifications. The immediate focus for authorities lies in recovering laundered assets and preventing further crypto conversions. On-chain analysts like ZachXBT now occupy a strategic role in global cyber defense, providing a powerful investigative path into crypto laundering networks.

2025-07-04T19:02:08,"Famous Bitcoin Analyst Makes New Prediction for BTC Price: “Michael Saylor’s Latest Move Points to BTC Price Target of…”","According to Bitcoin analyst James Check, we could be on the verge of a major rally in the cryptocurrency market. Check said that the 15% increase in new equity instruments launched after MicroStrategy rebranded to “Strategy” was a “critical signal” that Bitcoin would rally to $120,000. Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, has attracted attention in recent years by aggressively accumulating Bitcoin. The company currently holds about 597,000 BTC, equivalent to $63 billion in assets. While the bulk of those purchases were funded through convertible notes, three new preferred stock products Saylor announced this year have attracted significant interest from investors. According to James Check’s assessment in his Checkonchain newsletter, the rise of such financial instruments usually precedes major price movements. “This behavior is often seen before price explosions. I think it could take Bitcoin to $120,000 very quickly,” Check said. Related News: Following the Major Tax Law in the US, a Major Cryptocurrency Tax Bill Has Now Been Proposed This assessment comes in a week where optimistic predictions that Bitcoin could rise to $136,000 in July are on the agenda. The increasing optimism of market analysts is influenced by the decreasing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the US preparing for a new wave of liquidity and President Donald Trump continuing his crypto-friendly stance. According to Check, on-chain data also supports the bullish view. While implied volatility in options markets has fallen to record lows, short positions in futures are increasing, reinforcing the possibility of a potential short squeeze. In addition, monthly stablecoin inflows are between $4 billion and $6 billion. All these developments point to large players quietly accumulating. But not all investors agree. Notorious short seller Jim Chanos argues that the premium between Strategy’s stock price and the market value of its Bitcoin holdings is unreasonable. Chanos called Saylor’s financial engineering “absolute nonsense” and described Strategy investors as “crazy.” *This is not investment advice.

Berkshire Hathaway’s latest Form 13F filings show the Wall Street legend bought about 20 million shares of Sirius XM (SIRI) in Q3 2024 through Q1 2025, valued at about $459 million based on an average price of $22.95 per share. That brings Berkshire’s total SIRI holdings to a whopping 119,776,692 shares, worth about $2.9 billion at time of publishing – accounting for more than 35% of the company’s outstanding shares. The purchase is an attempt to buy-the-dip in the satellite and online audio entertainment service company, which offers a wide variety of programming including music, news, sports, talk and comedy. The stock has dropped by about 45% from its 52-week high of $41.60 to $24.29 at time of publishing. In that time, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which gained over 30%. In Q1 2025, Sirius XM reported a 4% revenue drop to $2.07 billion and a 6% decline in earnings per share to $0.59, missing analyst expectations. In Q2, the company reported continued subscriber losses and a 5% revenue decrease in the Sirius XM segment. The firm offers a 5.2% dividend yield, which makes it more attractive to income-focused investors like Buffett, who likely sees long-term value in Sirius XM’s strong brand and recurring revenue model.

In a new report, S&P Global says the US dollar is rapidly weakening due to tariffs, threats to the Federal Reserve’s independence, rising US debt and inflation fears. “The US dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of its currency peers, has fallen about 10.8% since the start of the year. That marks its worst first six months of a year since 1973. The greenback now sits at its lowest levels since February 2022 and stands to weaken further, according to currency strategists.” The US dollar’s plummeting began after US President Donald Trump took office in January. Says Derek Halpenny, managing director and head of research with MUFG Bank, “The trigger for the move may have been uncertainties over the policy outlook, on trade in particular, but the erratic nature of policy formation as well.” Elias Haddad, a global macro strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman, says that the US dollar is suffering from various factors that are likely to cause “structural drag” over the long term. “By all measures, the dollar dominates on the international stage as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. However, loss of confidence in US trade, fiscal, and security policies, and political meddling with the Fed’s independence threaten to accelerate the dollar’s declining role as the primary reserve currency.” The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading at 97.03 at time of writing.

Quant ( QNT ) was trading at $105 on July 4, up over 75% from its lowest level this year. This rally has brought its market capitalization to over $1.2 billion, ranking it as the 60th largest coin in the industry. Quant Network gained traction earlier this year when Oracle launched the Oracle Blockchain Platform Digital Assets Edition using its technology. OBP DA is an enterprise-grade solution designed to streamline the development and deployment of digital asset applications. It simplifies and accelerates tokenization efforts by integrating a robust distributed ledger infrastructure with pre-packaged smart contracts. Oracle utilizes Quant’s Overledger solution in this product. You might also like: Bitcoin wallet wakes up after 14 years, moves 80,000 BTC Quant Network further rallied after being named among a group of companies assisting the European Central Bank in developing a digital euro. There is optimism that the ECB may also adopt Quant’s Overledger solution. Overledger is a blockchain-agnostic operating system that enables interoperability between blockchain networks and traditional systems. Quant’s price may also benefit from the development of Fusion, a framework designed to secure assets, data, and logic across both public and permissioned distributed ledgers. Fusion’s Devnet launched last week, with the testnet scheduled for release this month. The mainnet is expected “within months,” to be followed by the mainnet+. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows that the supply of QNT tokens on exchanges has dropped to 1.64 million, its lowest level since May 25, a sign that investors are moving their tokens into self-custody wallets. QNT exchage balances | Source: Santiment Quant price technical analysis QNT price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart indicates that QNT bottomed at $59.25 in April and rebounded to $120 in June. It has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, characterized by two distinct swings and a rounded bottom. The recent retreat represents the handle portion of this formation. The distance between the cup’s upper and lower bounds is approximately 50%. Projecting this same distance from the upper boundary points to a potential rally toward $180, representing a 71% gain from the current level. However, this bullish forecast would be invalidated if the token drops below the support level at $85.78.

2025-07-04T18:18:57,"This Critical Binance Metric Suggests Incoming Surprises for Bitcoin: What You Need to Know","Binance’s net taker volume surged past $100 million just ahead of the latest US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report. Such a trend points to aggressive buying as traders position for a key macroeconomic catalyst. Binance Sees Aggressive Buy Orders In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant revealed thaft this spike reflects large market buy orders on Binance, indicating strong bullish sentiment or speculative bets on continued market momentum. The US labor market report, released shortly after, showed Nonfarm Payrolls increasing by 147,000 in June. This figure exceeded analysts’ expectations of 110,000-118,000. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1% from 4.2% in May and was the lowest level since February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The stronger-than-expected employment data reduces the chances of near-term rate cuts, ultimately backing the Fed’s plan to maintain higher rates to control inflation. Market-implied probabilities now reveal a 95% chance the Fed will hold rates steady at its July meeting, as it rose from 75% before the jobs report was released. A resilient jobs market has strengthened the US dollar, as expectations of delayed or reduced interest rate cuts make the currency more attractive relative to others. Historically, strong NFP data and hawkish Fed expectations have weighed on risk assets, including Bitcoin, as a firmer dollar environment tends to reduce the relative appeal of alternative assets. The combination of Binance’s aggressive buy-side activity and the strong jobs report could pave the way for potential volatility in crypto markets as traders assess the Fed’s policy outlook and the broader macro environment. After US jobs data beat forecasts, Bitcoin briefly climbed above $110K before retreating to $108.8K. July Seasonality Fuel Optimism As per crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades’ observation, holding above $108K is critical for the leading crypto asset to avoid a downward spiral. He considers a close near the $110K region a healthy sign. Meanwhile, Matrixport noted that July has historically been a strong month for Bitcoin, as 7 out of the last 10 Julys have closed positively and have an average return of over 9.1%. Supported by the improving Fed outlook and post-July 4 optimism, the next few weeks could offer a final push higher before another round of consolidation. The Greed & Fear Index is also bottoming out, a signal that often precedes upward momentum in Bitcoin’s price.

2025-07-04T18:10:45,"Bitcoin Whales Splash $3.8 Billion During Market Dip While Small Traders Flee in Panic","Bitcoin (BTC) traded relatively flat on Friday, extending its week-long consolidation as the market grappled with mixed signals. Adding to market uncertainty, reports emerged that Binance was offloading Bitcoin . On February 10, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan further flagged a dormant Bitcoin wallet that moved 14,000 BTC after being inactive for 7 to 10 years. This development raised speculation about potential sell-offs. However, Julio Moreno, another analyst at CryptoQuant, refuted these claims, stating that on-chain data did not indicate any unusual activity in Binance’s reserves. “Some talk about Binance moving its assets. Looking into our on-chain data, the exchange’s reserves don’t show any odd behavior. Bitcoin reserves drawdown is in line with what other exchanges are experiencing,” wrote Moreno. Despite these bearish signals, Bitcoin whales have taken advantage of the dip to accumulate significant amounts of BTC. On-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock reported that large investors purchased nearly $3.8 billion worth of Bitcoin during the recent downturn. Notably, on February 5, a net inflow of approximately 40,000 BTC was recorded, indicating strong accumulation by deep-pocketed entities. This trend aligns with a sharp decline in Bitcoin Over the Counter (OTC) desk balances, as noted by CryptoQuant analyst Darkforst. According to Pundit, institutional investors, such as hedge funds and governments, have increasingly turned to OTC desks to acquire Bitcoin without influencing market prices. This surge in demand has driven OTC balances down from approximately 480,000 BTC in September 2021 to just 146,000 BTC today. The ongoing depletion of OTC reserves indicates a sustained interest in Bitcoin among institutional investors. If this trend persists, buying pressure may shift directly to exchanges, positively influencing Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Meanwhile, on-chain data from Santiment has revealed notable divergences in network activity among major cryptocurrencies. On Thursday, the firm noted that while Ethereum and XRP continue to see wallet growth, Bitcoin has experienced a decline of 277,240 non-empty wallets over the past three weeks. According to the firm, this drop appears to be driven by small traders exiting the market amid concerns about further price declines across the cryptocurrency sector. It, however, noted that historically, such downturns in retail participation have signaled strong mid- to long-term price performance, as whales and sharks accumulate coins and strategically drive markets higher when fear and uncertainty peak. However, cautionary signals remain that could hinder Bitcoin’s immediate recovery. Analysts at IntoTheBlock identified a significant resistance level formed by 1.6 million addresses collectively holding around 1.57 million BTC at an average purchase price of $97,200. With many of these holders currently at a loss, the analysts warned that this cohort may opt to sell near breakeven, introducing additional selling pressure and complicating any decisive bullish breakout. At press time, BTC was trading at $107,900, reflecting a 1.78% drop in the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-whales-splash-3-8-billion-during-market-dip-while-small-traders-flee-in-panic/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T18:00:39,"Macro Meets Crypto: Predicting Prices with CPI, Fed Rates & BTC Dominance","Institutional money has changed how crypto trades. Bitcoin and Ethereum now respond to economic news in ways that mirror traditional assets. Reports on the CPI, inflation, and interest rates move prices. This shift means macroeconomic indicators are no longer optional for crypto traders. They are part of the core playbook. This article explains how official data on inflation, central bank rates, and crypto-specific indicators like Bitcoin dominance can help anticipate market trends. The analysis draws on macro releases, crypto charts, and research from large trading desks. The goal is not to predict exact moves but to offer a practical guide to understanding how broader economic trends shape crypto performance. Inflation and Bitcoin: CPI’s Growing Grip on Crypto Inflation started rising sharply in early 2022. The Consumer Price Index , reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, reached nine percent year-over-year in June. Bitcoin fell six percent within three days of that release. Investors moved out of risk assets, expecting tighter financial conditions. This pattern continued through 2023 and 2024. When CPI came in lower than forecasts, Bitcoin often rebounded. For example, in November 2022, the month-over-month print was 0.1 percent against a forecast of 0.3 percent. Bitcoin gained nearly four percent within two days. CPI for all items rises 0.1% in May; shelter up #BLSData https://t.co/dJyJeKmvth — BLS-Labor Statistics (@BLS_gov) June 11, 2025 This repeated reaction suggests Bitcoin now trades more like tech stocks. It does not act like a hedge against inflation in the short term. Instead, it follows interest rate expectations. If inflation readings push the Federal Reserve toward cuts, traders often rotate into crypto. If inflation jumps, traders exit fast. CPI for May 2025 showed price growth slowing toward the Federal Reserve’s target. If that trend continues, investors may add risk again. However, if energy costs or wages lift inflation above forecasts, expectations may shift back toward tightening. Traders will likely adjust positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum based on these releases. CPI releases now act as drivers of short-term price direction. Fed Rates and Ethereum: Liquidity Cycles in Action The Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in March 2022. That cycle lasted until mid-2023, with the target range reaching 5.25 to 5.5 percent. Each increase indicated tighter liquidity. Ethereum often fell in the days following these announcements, mirroring declines in growth-focused equities. Ethereum Price 2022 (Source: CoinMarketCap) Ethereum’s sensitivity to rate decisions became clear in several key moments. After the June 2022 hike of 75 basis points, ETH dropped by over eight percent within 48 hours. The same pattern repeated in September. By contrast, when the Fed paused in July 2023, ETH rebounded by nearly five percent over the next three trading sessions. However, one exception came in March 2023. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic in financial markets. The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points but indicated it might stop soon. That shift helped ETH recover as it climbed from under $1,400 to over $1,800 within three weeks. These events show Ethereum’s link to monetary policy. Rate hikes tighten conditions and push ETH down. Pauses or signs of easing often lead to sharp rebounds. Ethereum trades like a proxy for risk appetite in a liquidity-driven market. Bitcoin Dominance: Crypto’s Own Macro Gauge Bitcoin dominance tracks the percentage of total crypto market value held in Bitcoin. When dominance rises, it often reflects a retreat to safety. During periods of macro tightening, investors reduce exposure to smaller tokens and move capital into Bitcoin. This behavior mirrors broader risk-off patterns. U.S. Interest Rate 2015-2025 (Federal Reserve Bank) From late 2021 through 2022, Bitcoin dominance climbed from under 40 percent to nearly 48 percent. That move came during sharp inflation spikes, and a series of Fed rate increases as the market pulled back from speculative assets. Dominance rose again in mid-2023, just before the Fed indicated a pause, and fell shortly after. This pattern supports a familiar cycle. In early risk-on phases, Bitcoin leads. Once it stabilizes, capital rotates into Ethereum, then into altcoins with lower market value. Drops in dominance often mark the beginning of these rotations. The index can act as a sign of changing sentiment within the market. Bitcoin dominance reflects how crypto investors respond to broader economic shifts. It can function like a barometer—trending upward when uncertainty grows and falling when conditions favor higher risk exposure. Institutional Macro Forecasts and the Next 90 Days Institutional research over the past year has increasingly tied macro indicators to digital asset performance. In an October 2024 report, Crypto.com Research stated: “Economic growth may generally indicate a more favourable environment for cryptocurrencies, but the impact will vary depending on other market conditions.” They noted that “increasing correlation between traditional markets and cryptocurrencies means that stock market performance may potentially provide valuable insights into potential crypto trends.” Looking ahead, the next 90 days include several macro events that could affect crypto direction. The July CPI data is due on August 12, with consensus forecasting a YoY increase of 2.8 percent. The next FOMC meeting is on September 17, where markets currently price a 25 basis point cut. The August nonfarm payroll report (due September 6) and Q2 GDP revision (August 29) also stand out as volatility triggers. These dates offer key decision points. A lower CPI print could reinforce Fed easing expectations and push capital into risk assets. On the other hand, a stronger-than-expected payroll may reduce those expectations. ETF-related flows and crypto-native reactions will likely hinge on these cues, reinforcing the case that macro indicators now drive the broader crypto narrative. Conclusion: A Macro-Informed Strategy Macroeconomic indicators now play a measurable role in shaping the crypto market direction. Inflation data, central bank policy , and internal metrics like Bitcoin dominance have shown clear relationships with past price shifts in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. These signs, when aligned, can offer a grounded framework for interpreting future moves. While no model captures every turn, tracking CPI releases, FOMC decisions, and market reactions allows for more informed positioning. Macro data will not replace crypto-native analysis, but it adds a broader context that is becoming harder to ignore. Keeping an economic calendar in view may prove as useful as any technical chart.

2025-07-04T17:56:56,"Brussels court delivers justice in crypto abduction case","Brussels Criminal Court sentenced three kidnappers to twelve years imprisonment each. They attacked crypto entrepreneur Stéphane Winkel’s wife outside their Forest home. The December 20, 2024, crypto abduction forced the couple to relocate completely. Winkel abandoned his cryptocurrency YouTube channel following the traumatic kidnapping attempt that devastated their lives. Brussels court delivers justice in crypto abduction case The 47th Chamber of the Brussels Criminal Court sentenced three kidnappers to twelve-year prison terms. They abducted Stéphane Winkel’s wife in a coordinated assault in front of their residence in Forest. The kidnappers abducted the crypto billionaire’s wife on December 20, 2024. Police officers acted swiftly following Winkel’s report to the authorities regarding the crypto kidnapping. The police pursued the getaway van along Belgian roads for approximately an hour. The chase stopped after the car had an accident near Bruges, leading to arrests. Court hearings revealed that the masterminds of the operation remain unidentified and at large. Three convicted defendants claimed that they were issued death threats forcing them to participate. Judges dismissed such allegations as empty during court hearings. Objects seized during searches: DH News One youth was also part of the kidnapping conspiracy and has separate juvenile court cases. The convicted kidnappers owe more than one million euros in civil restitution. The restitution is paid directly to the traumatized victims for what they went through. The Winkel family suffered tremendous psychological trauma following the December attack. They were forced to move out of their Forest home owing to continued security threats. Stéphane’s wife cannot work anymore after the traumatic experience of being kidnapped. The crypto business owner chose to abandon his popular YouTube channel completely. He had previously given free cryptocurrency tips to interested viewers on a daily basis. Winkel said that he had to protect his family and minimize public exposure. The attempted kidnapping stole their freedom and safety forever. Global surge in crypto-targeted abduction cases Cryptocurrency holders across different countries are exposed to increasingly violent crime targeting their virtual wealth. Several high-profile abductions were carried out in 2025, which is an ominous development in crypto violence. Paris saw a series of assaults on crypto influencers in May 2025. The father of a French crypto millionaire was kidnapped with the kidnappers demanding 5-7 million euros ransom. The kidnappers amputated one of the victim’s fingers to compel cooperation. French police freed him after 58 hours and arrested five suspects . A second Paris meeting on May 13 involved the crypto CEO’s grandchild and daughter. Three men in masks attempted to abduct them at gunpoint but were thwarted. The kidnap attempt was thwarted by the child’s father and other passersby. David Balland, Ledger wallet company co-founder, was the victim in January 2025. Kidnappers kidnapped Balland and his business partner from his home in central France. The kidnappers demanded 10 million euros and amputated one of Balland’s fingers. The victims were later released, with several suspects in custody. New York City experienced extended cases of torture against crypto millionaires. Italian crypto investor Valentinoofr Carturan was kidnapped for 17 days. Other crypto investors tortured him by hanging him, subjecting him to electric shock, and threatening him with chainsaws. They tried to make him disclose Bitcoin wallet credentials with a value of 28 million dollars. Belgian authorities arrested ten French suspects in March to abduct a relative of a crypto entrepreneur. Investigators found equipment designed for the installation of a torture chamber, pointing to the planned nature of such crimes. Security concerns bring about lifestyle changes for crypto entrepreneurs Cryptocurrency millionaires and their families are more under scrutiny than ever before to change their public image. The Winkel kidnapping case shows the effect of violent crime on the owners of cryptocurrency beyond monetary loss. Victims are faced with tough decisions between business and security. Stéphane Winkel closed down his popular YouTube channel after his wife attempted to kidnap him. Earlier, he provided free cryptocurrency advice to thousands of subscribers in regular videos. It was his primary means of engagement with the cryptocurrency community. The entrepreneur listed family security as his top priority after the December attack. Social media promotion and educational materials posed safety threats. Winkel conceded that success with cryptocurrencies drew unwanted attention from criminal networks. Criminal organizations increasingly probe crypto entrepreneurs through their online interactions and social media remarks. Public social media pages, YouTube accounts, and public speaking at conferences are treasure troves of information for potential attackers. The online history helps criminals identify wealthy targets and their families. The psychological impact on crypto families is more widespread than immediate trauma from assaults. Most successful crypto investors today have personal security or relocate to safer jurisdictions. Others forego public-facing business operations entirely in order to reduce risk. North American and European police forces record rising attempts at crypto abduction. Criminals target owners of cryptocurrencies as valuable commodities with liquid funds hard to track. The distributed nature of virtual money makes recovery challenging for victims. Security experts now counsel crypto business operators on best security practices in operations. They encompass restricting public exposure, changing daily habits, and maintaining family protection measures.

2025-07-04T17:51:52,"Crypto wrap: Bitcoin drops to $107k as ETH, XRP and SOL give up gains","The cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn on Friday, July 4, 2025, with Bitcoin price dropping from highs of $110,000 as the total market capitalization slipped to $3.3 trillion amid a 2.5% decline over the past 24 hours. Global crypto liquidations stood at $209 million, but were down 28% in the past 24 hours. As several coins dipped, the global trading volume decreased 32% to $95 billion, indicating a dip in interest. Losses came as Bitcoin holders beheld a staggering transfer of coins that had been dormant for over 14 years. Bitcoin price drops as 14-year dormant wallets move 80,000 BTC As noted above, Bitcoin dropped from highs of $110k to trade around $107,600 at the time of writing. This decline, while catalyzed by the broader market outlook that saw stock futures fall on Friday, also came amid a notable Bitcoin ecosystem development. Notably, eight dormant wallets, which have been dormant since 2011, collectively transferred 80,000 BTC valued at over $8.6 billion. “Among these wallets, two received their $BTC in early April-2011 when the price was $0.78, while the other six received in May-2011 at $3.37 per BTC. The total value then was just $217.8K,” Spot On Chain wrote on X. The coins moved to other wallets and not exchanges, suggesting the whale behind the Satoshi-era coins might be reallocating.

No evidence of selling 6:19 pm · 4 Jul 2025 51 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies Despite this, the movement saw the BTC price fall to support above $107k and threaten bulls’ plans for a retest of the all-time highs near $112k. Top altcoins pare gains – ETH, XRP, and SOL fall to support levels As BTC pared gains, major altcoins also faced pressure. Ethereum (ETH) dropped 3.6% to $2,484, testing, and XRP retreated 1.7% to $2.21. Both ETH and XRP were holding above critical support levels, as Solana (SOL) declined 3.4% to $145. This broad-based top altcoins correction reflects profit-taking, but analysts remain bullish amid a market sentiment that is buoyed by anticipation around spot exchange-traded funds. ETH could yet spike above $2,500 and target highs above $3,000. SOL recently rallied as the first Solana spot ETF with staking went live. Ripple’s network growth, with significant partnerships in place, also means buyers are optimistic about XRP. Ondo Finance agrees to buy Oasis Pro In a significant development for tokenized securities, Ondo Finance announced its acquisition of Oasis Pro, an SEC-registered broker-dealer, Alternative Trading System, and Transfer Agent, on July 4, 2025. This move equips Ondo with the necessary licenses and infrastructure to expand its tokenized financial ecosystem in the U.S. Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance, highlighted the acquisition as a step toward a regulated tokenized securities market, with Pat LaVecchia of Oasis Pro joining the team to lead the integration. The deal, backed by investors like Mirae Asset Ventures, underscores growing institutional adoption of blockchain technology. Top crypto performers and losers today Among the top performers, Pudgy Penguins’ native token was up 4% to $0.016, while Maple Finance traded 2% up around $0.54.

2025-07-04T17:50:23,"Trump’s crypto project WLFI faces its first real decentralization stress test","A governance vote to make WLFI tokens tradable is underway and will reveal whether the project is truly community-driven. But the bigger question is whether early backers are ready to cash in, or hold tight, as the team’s holdings remain frozen. On July 4, the team behind Trump-linked World Liberty Financial launched a pivotal governance vote , proposing to unlock tradability for its WLFI token. If passed, early supporters who bought tokens in WLFI’s closed-door funding rounds will see their holdings unlocked for the first time, while the team, founders, and advisors remain bound by longer lockups, a move framed as a test of the project’s commitment to decentralization. The proposal outlines a phased transition to open-market participation, beginning with token transferability and a limited distribution. A second vote will later determine if and when the remainder of early supporter allocations can be released. At face value, the first vote represents a routine governance milestone for a DeFi project. But in practice, it probes the fragile balance between ideology, liquidity, and control that defines WLFI’s unique place in the crypto ecosystem. You might also like: Over $1b flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs as macro sentiment improves Why this vote matters now and what’s really at stake The World Liberty Financial team cites “strong demand” from community members and ecosystem partners as the key driver behind the timing of the WLFI token tradability proposal. After a year of product development and brand-building, the protocol claims the foundation is stable enough to open the gates. The WLFI team calls this a “defining moment,” and in some ways, it is. If passed, the vote would mark a transition from a controlled, non-transferable token model to one where WLFI can circulate freely via peer-to-peer exchanges or secondary markets. Yet the timing is conspicuous. The vote comes just a week after Aqua 1’s $100 million token purchase , which granted the UAE fund significant governance influence. The WLFI team has not disclosed how many tokens Aqua 1 controls relative to total supply, but the optics are hard to ignore. A freshly onboarded institutional player now holds outsized voting power in what is being framed as a grassroots governance milestone. Regardless of the outcome, the vote is a revealing moment for World Liberty Financial, which is under scrutiny to prove its ecosystem can balance open participation with sustainable growth. Proponents argue that enabling trading will fuel broader adoption and governance engagement. Skeptics, however, warn that early backers—many of whom bought in at lower valuations, could trigger a sell-off, testing the token’s resilience before institutional players like Aqua 1 fully deploy their capital. The outcome won’t just shape WLFI’s liquidity; it will signal whether a project with political ties can withstand the pressures of true decentralization.

2025-07-04T17:50:12,"Trending Alternative Crypto to Dogecoin (DOGE) Set to Turn $650 into $65,000 in 4 Months","The post Trending Alternative Crypto to Dogecoin (DOGE) Set to Turn $650 into $65,000 in 4 Months appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Few tokens have stirred as much chaos and charm as Dogecoin. What started as a joke became a global phenomenon, fueled by memes, retail fervor, and the occasional tweet from Elon. But as DOGE continues to trade sideways, a fresh contender is making waves—one that isn’t just riding the meme wave but building a whole new surfboard. That contender is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . And if early indicators hold, this isn’t just another frog-themed token—it could be the next explosive altcoin to rival DOGE, SHIB, and even PEPE in both returns and cultural relevance. With three sold-out presale stages this June and a fourth now live at just $0.0013 per token, LILPEPE’s trajectory isn’t just bullish—it’s breakneck. Presale Frenzy Fuels Conviction Interest in Little Pepe has escalated at an unprecedented pace. The project’s first three presale phases sold out in a matter of days this June, underscoring widespread demand. Now in its fourth stage at just $0.0013 per token, the presale has already drawn more than $2.8 million in contributions as we enter the third quarter of 2025. Such rapid capital accumulation demonstrates investor confidence and provides a war chest for audits, mainnet deployment, and strategic partnerships that will reinforce LILPEPE’s market position. Road from $650 to $65,000 A $650 investment at the current $0.0013 price nets you 500,000 LILPEPE tokens. If the token hits just $0.13—a realistic scenario in a meme bull market—that position turns into $65,000. Skeptical? Don’t be. We’ve seen meme tokens do far more with far less. PEPE did it in weeks. DOGE did it in months. And LILPEPE isn’t starting from scratch—it’s beginning with momentum, a roadmap, real tech, and a hyper-engaged community that understands how to drive narrative. This is how outsized returns are made in crypto—not by waiting two years for a blue-chip to grind up slowly, but by finding the next catalyst before it explodes. An Anonymous Veteran’s Perspective A veteran Bitcoin investor who built his fortune during the early Bitcoin rallies has flagged Little Pepe as a rare opportunity with outsized profit potential. He remains unnamed by choice, preferring to let the project’s fundamentals speak louder than any personality. According to his assessment, the absence of buy or sell taxes, paired with anti-sniper launch safeguards, positions LILPEPE to capture genuine investor interest rather than fleeting, bot-driven spikes. The $777,000 Giveaway: A Marketing Masterstroke As if that weren’t enough, LILPEPE has rolled out a $777,000 giveaway to energize the community and attract new eyeballs. Ten winners will walk away with $77,000 in LILPEPE tokens, a prize pool that surpasses most of the other presales. But the giveaway is more than just a prize. It’s a signal—a declaration that this isn’t just another “launch and vanish” project. It’s designed to scale fast, hit hard, and reward the early believers who dare to leap before the rest of the market wakes up. How to Participate in the Fourth Presale Stage Joining the fourth presale stage of Little Pepe is straightforward. Download a Web3 wallet such as Trust Wallet, and fund it with ETH or USDT using the standard ERC-20 protocol. Proceed to the official littlepepe website to purchase your LILPEPE tokens at $0.0013, and confirm the transaction. Within moments, LILPEPE tokens appear in your wallet, granting immediate visibility ahead of the full presale wrap. A New Chapter Awaits Little Pepe is more than a fleeting meme; it’s the vanguard of a new meme finance era. By tackling Ethereum’s scaling challenges with a dedicated Layer 2 solution and embedding governance rights for token holders, LILPEPE transcends the ordinary hype cycle. For investors who recognize pattern shifts and seize discounted entry points, the next four months present a window to turn a modest stake into life-changing gains. As the presale clock winds down and the mainnet launch approaches, the question shifts from “if” to “when.” For believers who act decisively, Little Pepe could prove to be the defining trade of 2025.

2025-07-04T17:38:12,"Are Whales in Trouble? BTC Derivatives Flash Mixed Warnings","Bitcoin whales , big holders of the cryptocurrency, have been seen as major influencers in the market. Their movements often foreshadow broader trends, but recent developments in Bitcoin derivatives are raising questions about the stability of the current market. With large-scale shifts and mixed signals from key trading indicators, the market is bracing for potential turbulence. Whale Activity: A Double-Edged Sword On-chain data shows that Bitcoin whales, specifically those holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, have been accumulating in recent weeks. However, this accumulation isn’t all clear sailing. Recent developments in the derivatives market are offering a more complex picture. Despite the bullish behavior of whales, there are signs of caution elsewhere in the market. The derivatives market, which allows traders to speculate on future Bitcoin prices, is flashing a series of mixed signals. One key indicator is the Binance Liquidation Delta, which has seen consistent long position liquidations in recent days. Some of these liquidations have been massive, sometimes exceeding $40 million, which suggests that leveraged traders are unwinding positions. While this could be seen as a market correction or short-term volatility, it is also a sign of caution among traders who may be preparing for a downturn. However, this figure has dropped from 8%, signaling a potential loss of bullish momentum. The reduced premium suggests that traders might not be as confident about future price increases as they were before. Another important metric is the Exchange Whale Ratio, which tracks the amount of BTC entering exchanges compared to the total inflow. This ratio has been climbing, indicating that large transactions are dominating exchange volumes. Such activity is often associated with profit-taking or repositioning of assets, a move that could signal whales’ intentions to exit the market or minimize exposure to Bitcoin. Crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live highlighted strong bearish sentiment among traders in its recent market update. Traders are reportedly growing frustrated with the market’s stagnation, as volatility remains high, but price movements are muted. This could signal that while large players continue to accumulate, smaller traders are hedging their bets, potentially indicating a market in transition. All these factors come together to create a somewhat uncertain environment for Bitcoin. While the growing accumulation by whales indicates long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value, the increased caution in the derivatives market suggests that traders are bracing for a correction. Bitcoin’s price has been fluctuating around $109,500, just under the $110,000 resistance level. It’s currently in the upper range of its channel, and many traders are eyeing key levels, such as $108,890, which is critical for a bullish weekly close. In a market where Bitcoin’s price is susceptible to external movements, including those by large holders, this situation could trigger short-term volatility. The ongoing liquidation of leveraged positions, combined with the rise in the Exchange Whale Ratio, suggests that a shakeout may occur before any further upward momentum. With the mixed signals from the derivatives market and the continued whale accumulation, Bitcoin’s future price direction remains uncertain. If whales continue to hold and the derivatives market stabilizes, Bitcoin could see further growth. However, if the caution in the derivatives market persists, a short-term correction may be on the horizon.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/are-whales-in-trouble-btc-derivatives-flash-mixed-warnings/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T17:30:07,"Altcoins Are Staging a Rival Rally to Bitcoin's Dominance. Which Will Lead the Charge in July?","As Bitcoin holds its ground , other digital currencies are making significant moves. Excitement builds as alternative coins show potential for a remarkable surge. The upcoming month of July promises new leaders in the crypto arena. Readers will discover which altcoins are poised for impressive growth and could challenge Bitcoin's dominance. Ethereum Price Trends and Key Levels Analysis Ethereum saw a slight dip over the last month with a price drop of about 0.48% while showing a modest weekly gain of 7.21%. Over the past six months, the coin experienced a broader decline of roughly 28%. Price movements have been mixed, with short-term recoveries contrasting against the longer-term slump, underscoring the coin’s sensitivity to market pressures and oscillating sentiments. The current trading range for Ethereum sits between approximately $2111 and $2870. Key support is found at $1735.41 with additional backing near $975.87, while resistance levels are marked at $3254.46 and a secondary barrier at $4013.99. The market shows no clear dominance by bulls or bears. Momentum reading at 180.06 and an RSI near 57.27 indicate some buying activity, while the Awesome Oscillator leans bearish at -16.3795. Trading strategies may focus on buying near support at $1735.41 and selling near resistance at $3254.46, with opportunities for swing trades in the absence of a clear trend. XRP Price Trends: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Correction Over the past month, XRP gained approximately 4.67% and experienced a 5.17% increase over the last week. In the last six months, the token declined by about 6.37%, indicating a period of overall correction despite the recent rebound. The coin has shown short bursts of momentum against a backdrop of prolonged bearish trends. Price oscillations have been notable, with incremental advances in recent weeks contrasting with earlier declines. The market experienced phases of recovery interspersed with cautious retracements, reflecting short-term optimism and mid-term pressures. Recent behavior suggests improving sentiment, even while historical data underscores ongoing challenges, indicating a coin in a state of flux. Currently, the coin trades between $1.98 and $2.41, with immediate resistance at $2.59 and a secondary barrier around $3.02. Support is identified at $1.73, with further cushion near $1.31. Recent gains highlight buyer interest, yet sellers remain active near key resistance levels. A lack of a clear, sustained trend offers trading opportunities within this range. Buyers may seek entries around the $1.73 support, while a break above $2.59 could set the stage for targeting $3.02. Short-term trades may leverage price movements around these levels, though caution is warranted due to mixed technical signals and the influence of longer-term downturns. Cardano's Price Movements: Analyzing Recent Market Behavior Cardano has shown marked fluctuation with a weekly rise of nearly 7% followed by a 12% drop over the last month and an even steeper decline of 44% over the past six months. The price trended between $0.48 and $0.70 during this period, with intermittent rises that could not sustain momentum. Price levels have consistently tested nearby resistance around $0.83 while responses near support levels around $0.38 and $0.16 hint at possible buying interest. Data reflects a period of significant adjustment and retracement, with technical indicators pointing to uncertain market sentiment as the coin struggled to reclaim higher territory. The coin’s current trading range between $0.48 and $0.70 emphasizes key technical levels. A primary support is found near $0.38 with a second level around $0.16, while resistance is seen near $0.83 and again at $1.05. Bullish activity appears near the lower support as buyers may step in, but bearish pressure persists, keeping the overall trend unclear. Oscillators and a balanced RSI of approximately 50 highlight a market in limbo. Traders could consider short-term buying opportunities near support if the price holds and monitor any breakthrough toward resistance. Attention to these defined zones may offer clear entry and exit points as mixed signals suggest a cautious approach amid ongoing market fluctuation. Conclusion ETH , XRP , and ADA are showing strong performance and could be key players. ETH's ongoing upgrades make it a serious contender. XRP's legal victories boost investor confidence. ADA's tech developments increase its appeal. Together, these factors make it likely that one or more of these coins could lead in the coming weeks. Keep an eye on their performance as July progresses. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
