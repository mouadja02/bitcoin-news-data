2025-07-04T14:51:22,"Pi Coin Price Prediction – Pi Network Gains DeFi Momentum With Zypto Integration: Is a Full Recovery on the Table?","A decentralized payment app called Zypto has added Pi Coin (PI) support to its mobile platform so “pioneers” can now use their assets to cover their day-to-day expenses via its physical and virtual VISA cards. New use cases for this token favor a bullish Pi Coin price prediction . The Zypto payment app is supported in more than 10 countries at the time of writing and supports more than 24,000 cryptocurrencies. Pioneers, Zypto is now on the Pi KYB verified list.

The news comes roughly a week after Pi Day, an event held by the development team in which they shared with the community some new features and updates. Pi has been criticized for its lack of ecosystem growth initiatives following the launch of its public mainnet in February. This collaboration with Zypto could help ease the decline that Pi Coin has experienced lately as its supply has been expanding rapidly. Pi Coin Price Prediction: PI Could Rise to $0.57 If This Key Support Holds In the past 7 days, Pi Coin has retreated by more than 12% but seems to have found strong support at $0.4750. The token has already bounced two times off this level and could be entering a phase of accumulation ahead of further ecosystem news. In the 4-hour chart, the price has moved off its falling wedge but not with sufficient strength to confirm a bullish breakout. Both the 9-day and 21-period exponential moving averages (EMAs) remain on a downtrend while the token is trading below its 200-day EMA as well. The $0.4750 is the most critical level to watch for Pi as a drop below this area could push the token to a new all-time low. This Zypto announcement favors a bullish Pi Coin price prediction as it could help PI in bouncing off this area and retest the $0.57 target shown in the chart. A full recovery to $1 seems difficult at the time, especially as Pi’s daily token unlocks will continue to be quite high during the next couple of weeks or so according to data from PiScan . However, as the rate at which its supply is expanding decreases, the market could start to assign more weight to this kind of announcement. While Pi continues to struggle, Bitcoin-linked crypto presales are gaining traction. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is a standout example, having already raised over $8 million and attracting growing investor interest. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Hands Over Rewards Based on How Bitcoin Performs Bitcoin is currently trading at $110,000, bringing it closer to the first reward milestone set by BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) — a meme coin designed to reward Bitcoin holders with passive income. BTCBULL’s unique system offers two types of incentives: Bitcoin airdrops and token burns. The structure is simple. Starting from a $100,000 BTC baseline, new rewards are unlocked every time Bitcoin gains another $25,000. At $125,000, a portion of BTCBULL’s supply will be permanently burned, reducing circulation and potentially boosting the token’s price. Next up, once the top crypto reaches $150,000, token holders will receive a direct BTC airdrop in their wallets where they hold BTCBULL in correspondence to the number of tokens that they hold. To buy $BTCBULL, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

2025-07-04T14:50:41,"Belgian Court Jails Trio 12 Years for Crypto Investor’s Wife Kidnapping—Masterminds Still at Large","A court in Brussels has sentenced three men to 12 years in prison for the December 2024 abduction of the wife of Belgian crypto investor and content creator Stephane Winkel. The sentencing, handed down on Thursday, comes as European authorities face a rising number of crypto-linked kidnapping cases. According to prosecutors, the group snatched Winkel’s wife outside their home on December 20 and forced her into a van registered in France. The attackers then attempted to flee toward the Belgian coast. Winkel immediately contacted the police, triggering a swift response. Officers intercepted the van near Bruges, forcing it into a ditch and arresting the three adults inside. A fourth suspect, a minor, was referred to juvenile court. Three Jailed in Winkel Kidnapping, But Crypto Plot’s Masterminds Still Unknown Local media outlet La Dernière Heure reported that the kidnappers were convicted of hostage-taking and attempting to extort cryptocurrency as ransom. During the trial, the defendants claimed they had been acting under threat from unnamed “sponsors” who would have killed them if they refused. The court dismissed this version of events, describing the crime as a deliberate and professional hostage operation. Le verdict est tombé : 12 ans de prison ferme pour les ravisseurs de mon épouse.

Ils devront aussi verser 1 million d’euros de… pic.twitter.com/1431rAqvac — Stéphane | Crypto Académie (@StephaneWinkel) July 4, 2025 Authorities believe the kidnapping was financially motivated, with investigators linking it to other crypto-related abduction attempts in Belgium and neighboring France. While the court has now sentenced those who physically carried out the act, the broader investigation remains active, and officials have yet to identify the masterminds behind the operation. In addition to prison time, the court also ordered the convicted men to pay over €1 million (around $1.2 million) in damages to the victim. Winkel and his wife, who were deeply shaken by the event, have since relocated for safety reasons. Winkel, a well-known figure in the Belgian crypto space, runs educational platforms including Crypto Académie and Crypto Sun. He also operates a YouTube channel with nearly 40,000 subscribers, where he previously offered wallet demonstrations, market commentary, and contests. Following the attack, Winkel stepped back from public appearances. In a January post on X , he wrote, “I consider myself a defender of freedom, but I now realize that safety must become an absolute priority for me and those around me.” Récapitulatif de l'enlèvement : On est le vendredi 20 décembre, 10 heures du matin : une camionnette avec quatre individus à bord a fait irruption dans ma rue et a enlevé de force ma femme. J’ai entendu des cris depuis mon bureau et je me suis précipité dehors. J’ai vu la… — Stéphane | Crypto Académie (@StephaneWinkel) January 6, 2025 He pledged to return to crypto education, but with a different approach, one that avoids personal exposure and high-risk demonstrations. “No more contests or wallet demonstrations,” he said, instead promising to focus on market analysis and user protection. Winkel reappeared on YouTube in late June, releasing his first video since the incident. This time, the video featured only voiceover narration, no on-camera presence. While the sentencing marks progress in the case, authorities continue their search for those believed to have orchestrated the plot. The Belgian police confirmed that investigations are ongoing into what they describe as an expanding network behind a series of targeted kidnappings in the European crypto sector. Global Wave of Crypto-Related Kidnappings Intensifies The case of the Belgian family is not an isolated incident. Around the world, crypto investors with public profiles are becoming prime targets in a disturbing trend of high-stakes abductions. A recent report noted that Australian crypto billionaire Tim Heath, last July, narrowly escaped a kidnapping attempt in Tallinn, Estonia. Heath, founder of Yolo Group, was ambushed by two men posing as painters. Australian crypto billionaire Tim Heath escaped a violent kidnapping attempt in Tallinn, Estonia, by biting off part of an attacker’s finger. #Crypto #Crime https://t.co/Bc3xo2O4So — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 3, 2025 One of them, a former boxer from Azerbaijan, tried to muffle Heath’s screams, only to lose part of his finger when Heath bit down in self-defense. Court records revealed the attackers had tracked Heath’s movements using a GPS device and planned to transport him to a rented sauna house to force a crypto transfer. France has seen a similar spike. In June, a TikTok crypto influencer was abducted and beaten in Essonne after attackers demanded €50,000 in crypto. When his attackers found his wallet nearly empty, they released him. Days later, another man was held hostage in Paris while his kidnappers demanded his Ledger wallet and cash. His partner was coerced into handing over €5,000 before he was freed.

2025-07-04T14:50:36,"Bitcoin Plunge Warning: Analyst Predicts Bearish Shift Below $108K","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Plunge Warning: Analyst Predicts Bearish Shift Below $108K The world of cryptocurrency is a constant whirlwind of volatility and opportunity. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding the intricate dance of digital asset prices is paramount. When a seasoned crypto analyst issues a stark warning, the market tends to listen. Recently, a significant alert has emerged concerning Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, suggesting a potentially dramatic shift in its market trajectory. Is Bitcoin on the Brink? Understanding the $108,000 Threshold Daan Crypto Trades, a well-regarded voice in the crypto analysis space, has pointed to a critical juncture for Bitcoin . According to a report by Cointelegraph, the analyst suggests that if BTC fails to hold the crucial $108,000 support level, the market could witness a definitive bearish turn. This isn’t just an arbitrary number; in technical analysis, specific price points often act as psychological or structural barriers that dictate future movements. A breach of such a level can signal a significant change in market sentiment and momentum. What makes this particular threshold so vital? In trading, support levels are price points where a downtrend is expected to pause due to a concentration of demand. If demand at this level is insufficient to absorb selling pressure, the price can ‘break’ through, often leading to accelerated declines as stop-loss orders are triggered and new sellers enter the market. The $108,000 mark appears to be one such line in the sand for Bitcoin ‘s current consolidation phase. The Curious Case of Current BTC Consolidation One of the key insights from Daan Crypto Trades is that the current consolidation pattern of BTC looks somewhat different from its predecessors in this market cycle. Consolidation typically refers to a period where an asset’s price trades within a relatively narrow range, indicating a balance between buying and selling pressure before a decisive move. Historically, Bitcoin has often consolidated before significant upward trends. The analyst explains that while the pattern still follows the general blueprint – where it ‘stalls, deviates below, retakes the range and then grinds higher’ – there’s a crucial missing element: ‘the actual breakout and continuation.’ This suggests that while Bitcoin has shown resilience in bouncing back into its range, it hasn’t demonstrated the strong follow-through buying pressure needed to propel it into a sustained upward trend. This lack of conviction from buyers, combined with persistent selling pressure at higher levels, creates a precarious balance. Without a clear breakout, the risk of a downside move intensifies, making the $108,000 level even more precarious. Key Characteristics of Current BTC Consolidation: Stalling: Price action has paused its upward momentum. Deviation Below: Brief dips below expected support levels occur. Retaking the Range: Price manages to recover and re-enter the previous trading range. Grinding Higher (or Sideways): Slow, often unconvincing upward movement or prolonged sideways trading. Missing Element: Lack of a strong, decisive breakout and sustained continuation. The Ominous Bearish Outlook: What Happens Below $108,000? The implications of Bitcoin failing to hold the $108,000 support are significant. According to the analyst, such a failure could pave the way for a drop below the psychologically important $100,000 mark once again. This isn’t just about a few thousand dollars; breaking a major round number like $100,000 can trigger widespread panic selling and a loss of confidence among retail and institutional investors alike. A move below $100,000 could lead to a cascading effect, where further support levels are tested and potentially broken. This scenario would firmly establish a bearish trend, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, increased volatility, and potentially longer periods of decline. For traders, this means shifting strategies from seeking long opportunities to looking for short positions or simply staying on the sidelines. For long-term holders, it could mean enduring deeper drawdowns and a test of conviction. Potential Market Reactions to a Break Below $108,000: Increased Selling Pressure: Traders with stop-loss orders below $108,000 would exit their positions. Psychological Impact: A break below $100,000 could trigger FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) across the market. Liquidation Cascades: Leveraged positions could face margin calls and forced liquidations, accelerating the decline. Altcoin Impact: Historically, when Bitcoin experiences significant drops, altcoins tend to follow, often with even greater percentage losses. Shift in Market Sentiment: A prevailing optimistic sentiment could quickly turn negative, leading to reduced participation and investment. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Price Prediction While the analyst’s warning paints a cautious picture, it also provides valuable information for informed decision-making. Understanding potential support and resistance levels, as well as market patterns, is crucial for developing a robust trading or investment strategy. Here are some actionable insights for navigating these uncertain times: Monitor the $108,000 Level Closely: This is the immediate key. Watch how Bitcoin reacts if it approaches or tests this level. Strong bounces would indicate resilience, while swift breaks would confirm the bearish outlook. Risk Management is Paramount: If you are actively trading, consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the price drops. For long-term investors, ensure your portfolio is diversified and you are not over-leveraged. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, a bearish turn could present opportunities to accumulate at lower prices. DCA involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, which averages out your entry cost over time. Stay Informed, But Filter Noise: Follow reputable analysts like Daan Crypto Trades, but always cross-reference information and conduct your own research. The crypto market is rife with speculation and misinformation. Prepare for Volatility: Bitcoin’s price action is notoriously volatile. Be mentally prepared for significant swings in either direction and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term price movements. Look for Confirmation: Don’t act on a single signal. Wait for clear confirmation of a trend reversal or continuation before making significant moves. For instance, a break below $108,000 followed by a sustained period below it, perhaps even breaking $100,000, would be stronger confirmation of a bearish trend than a brief wick below. Beyond the Immediate Warning: Broader Market Context It’s important to remember that Bitcoin’s price is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond technical analysis alone. Macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and global economic stability, play a significant role. Regulatory developments, institutional adoption news, and even major geopolitical events can all sway market sentiment. For instance, increasing institutional interest and the approval of new investment vehicles can provide significant upward momentum, while stricter regulations or negative headlines can trigger sell-offs. The upcoming Bitcoin halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, are also historically significant drivers of bull markets, though their impact is often delayed and complex. Understanding this broader context helps in forming a more holistic price prediction . While a technical analyst might highlight a specific price point, the underlying fundamentals and external forces often dictate the strength and duration of any trend. The Resilience of Bitcoin : A Historical Perspective While a potential bearish turn is concerning, it’s also crucial to remember Bitcoin’s history of resilience. The cryptocurrency has weathered numerous bear markets, significant price corrections, and periods of intense skepticism, only to emerge stronger. Each major downturn has historically purged weaker projects and over-leveraged participants, paving the way for more sustainable growth. This historical perspective doesn’t negate the immediate warning but serves as a reminder of Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Short-term volatility and bearish phases are inherent to nascent, high-growth markets. For long-term investors, these periods can often be seen as opportunities rather than existential threats, provided one has a sound investment strategy and conviction in the asset’s future. Concluding Thoughts: Staying Vigilant in a Dynamic Market The warning from Daan Crypto Trades serves as a timely reminder of the delicate balance in the cryptocurrency market. The $108,000 level is undeniably a critical point for Bitcoin , and its ability to hold this support will likely dictate its immediate future. A failure to do so could usher in a significant bearish phase, potentially seeing BTC drop below $100,000. As always, informed decision-making, robust risk management, and a long-term perspective are your best allies in navigating the unpredictable waters of digital assets. Whether Bitcoin holds strong or succumbs to selling pressure, the market will continue to evolve, presenting new challenges and opportunities for those who are prepared.

What Does It Mean?","The seasonal effects of the summer months have begun to show themselves in cryptocurrency markets. In June, total Bitcoin futures volume fell by about 20% compared to the previous month, to $1.55 trillion. This figure was well below the monthly average volume of $1.93 trillion in the first five months of 2025. Bitcoin Futures Volume Drops 20% in June: Signal of Summer Recession in Crypto Markets A similar trend was observed last year, when June 2024 futures volume fell 15.7% on a monthly basis, but average volume remained low throughout the summer, although it partially recovered in July. While the monthly average was $1.53 trillion during the June-September 2024 period, this figure remained 10% below the $1.71 trillion average in the first five months of the year. This seasonal downtrend was also seen in 2023. Bitcoin futures volume, which averaged $1.03 trillion per month in the first half of 2023, fell to $717 billion in July 2023, falling by about 30% on a monthly basis. The decline continued in the following two months, with a 2.4% decrease in August and a 21.5% decrease in September. Data for June 2025 indicates that the trend of volume decline in the summer months may be repeated this year. Analysts say that although it is too early to make a definitive judgment, this development strengthens the possibility of a summer recession in crypto markets. Trading volumes in the coming months will clarify the impact of this season on the market. *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, JPMorgan executive David Kelly says that the White House’s 3% projected growth for the economy doesn’t make sense as the US doesn’t have the means to boost productivity to match. According to Kelly, baby boomers retiring and shrinking employment numbers will impact the growth of the US economy. However, though he says 3% is untenable, he does envision the economy growing in part. “I don’t see how we’ll do that. In order to do that, you’ve got to boost productivity, because if you look at the US economic growth, in the long run, so far this century, it’s been about 2%. That’s 1.5% from productivity and 0.5% from the growth in labor. The problem is that the baby boomers are retiring, the nation-born working age population is shrinking, so if you end up with zero net immigration, you got no employment growth and that means [you grow] 1.5%, not 3%. Now we might do better than 1.5%, but we’re not close to 3%. There’s nothing in the outlook which tells me that we can sustain 3% growth.” The White House’s projection for the growth of the US economy is related to President Donald Trump’s latest spending bill, which included extensions on tax breaks and is currently being voted on in Congress.

This level has acted as a major pivot in the past, and reclaiming it with strength would likely attract fresh buying pressure. With Bitcoin dominance remaining high and capital rotating selectively into altcoins, Chainlink’s upcoming moves could signal a higher altcoin market direction. Investors and traders are closely watching this consolidation, waiting for a breakout that could kickstart the next leg higher for LINK and potentially confirm the beginning of a stronger altcoin cycle. The coming days could be critical in determining whether Chainlink is ready to rejoin the uptrend. Chainlink Builds Momentum Chainlink has seen a strong resurgence over the past two weeks, gaining more than 22% in value since June 22. After months of consolidation and sideways action, the recent price movement suggests that bullish momentum is returning to the altcoin. The broader market environment is improving, with Bitcoin nearing its all-time high and risk appetite gradually increasing across crypto assets. For Chainlink, this has translated into renewed optimism and a growing expectation of a breakout. Fundamentally, Chainlink remains one of the most important infrastructure projects in the crypto space. Its partnerships with high-profile projects such as Ripple and Ondo Finance highlight its crucial role in powering real-world asset tokenization and secure on-chain data feeds. These integrations support long-term utility and demand, reinforcing investor confidence in the project’s future. Ali Martinez emphasized that holding above the $12 level is key for Chainlink. According to his analysis, sustained price action above this zone could pave the way for a breakout toward the $18–$20 range. Historically, LINK has shown strong impulsive moves after breaking major consolidation zones, and the current structure appears similar. Related Reading: Ethereum Looks Strong Despite Volatility – $10,000 Price Target Gains Momentum LINK Consolidates Below Resistance Chainlink is currently trading at $13.32 after facing a minor rejection from the $14 zone. The chart shows that LINK remains in a consolidation range that began in early March, with price action confined between the $12.20 and $14.50 levels. The token has made multiple attempts to reclaim the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which now sit just above the current price action. These moving averages, along with horizontal resistance around $14, are acting as a strong ceiling for now. Despite the recent pullback, LINK remains structurally bullish on the mid-term as it prints higher lows since the June bottom near $11. Analysts remain optimistic that a decisive close above $14–$14.50 would invalidate this range and pave the way for a push toward the $16–$18 zone. Related Reading: Tron DeFi Activity Expands: SunSwap Hits $3B+ Monthly Swaps In 2025 The 200-day moving average near $16.77 remains a key target in the event of a breakout. However, failure to reclaim $14 could lead to another test of support around $12. Overall, the setup remains constructive but will require renewed bullish momentum—possibly led by Bitcoin strength or positive ecosystem news—for a breakout confirmation. Until then, LINK continues to oscillate in a tight range, with bulls watching closely.

2025-07-04T14:27:25,"PlanB Analyst Predicts a $500K Bitcoin by 2028, Fueling Presales Like Bitcoin Hyper","PlanB reinforced the prediction of a $500K Bitcoin by 2028 made in May, based on $BTC’s 4-year halving cycle. The 2020-2024 cycle went against a price prediction of $55K, to only reach $34K, which was unexpectedly close, given the market’s performance and Bitcoin’s volatility. This time around, PlanB’s projected Bitcoin price should push between $250K and $1M, with a likely average outcome of $400K-$600K. To note: PlanB’s Bitcoin price prediction for the 2028-2032 halving delivers a mouth-watering $4M price tag. Is This Bitcoin Prediction Accurate? PlanB’s prediction relies on the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, which assesses Bitcoin’s potential price by dividing Bitcoin’s current stock by the annual flow of the newly-mined supply. Based on this data, the price prediction should be fairly accurate, especially based on Bitcoin’s past performance. Based on the S2F model, Bitcoin’s value should theoretically go up with each halving due to the increase in scarcity. As Coinglass puts it: This model treats Bitcoin as being comparable to commodities such as gold, silver or platinum. These are known as ‘store of value’ commodities because they retain value over long time frames due to their relative scarcity. — Coinglass, Stock-To-Flow Model And, because Bitcoin’s scarcity factor goes up with each halving, we should expect $BTC’s price to go exponentially higher with each 4-year cycle. This explains why PlanB’s 2028-2032 prediction has Bitcoin as high as $4M, almost a 10x jump from the current cycle’s prediction. More importantly, Bitcoin’s price is influenced by numerous factors, aside from its cyclical halving, including financial and economical. One such factor is Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill, which the US Congress just wrote into law , bringing notable changes like tax cuts and a larger deficit ceiling. While the Bill is facing both praise and criticism , one thing is for sure: it will likely cause Bitcoin to rally. And if Bitcoin rallies, the entire crypto market will follow, including some of the best presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) to Upgrade Bitcoin’s Ecosystem for Faster Transaction Speeds and Lower Costs Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is Bitcoin’s official Layer 2 upgrade that aims to solve the most pressing problem with the Bitcoin ecosystem: its poor performance, limited to only 7 Transactions Per Second (TPS). Bitcoin Hyper relies on two primary tools to bring Bitcoin’s performance to modern-day standards: the Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine. The Canonical Bridge mints a number of wrapped $BTC equal to the Bitcoins that the users deposit into the bridge, while the Solana Virtual Machine allows for lightning-fast smart contract execution. These tools turn Bitcoin Hyper into a high-performance foundation that the Bitcoin ecosystem can keep building upon. $HYPER is currently in presale since May 2025 and has accumulated over $1.9M so far. The token sits at $0.012125, but shows outstanding growth potential, based on Layer 2’s utility within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our analysts predict a $0.32 $HYPER by the end of 2025 and a projected price point of $1.5 or higher by 2030. This means that, in 5-year time, $HYPER could deliver an ROI of 12,300% if you invest at today’s price. If you want to support the project or you want a slice of the 409% staking APY, go to the presale page and buy your $HYPER today . What to Expect From Bitcoin? Going long on Bitcoin is the safest bet today, based on how the market looks in the current pro-crypto economical context. Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill alone has the power to push the Bitcoin bull into a chart rage and we’ll likely see it sooner rather than later. And if Bitcoin rallies, everybody rallies, including new crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER ). Don’t take this as financial advice.

2025-07-04T14:23:08,"Senator Lummis Proposes Crypto Tax Reforms as IRS Faces Watchdog Criticism","Senator Cynthia Lummis has unveiled a new legislative proposal aimed at updating the United States’ tax framework for digital assets, following the exclusion of crypto provisions from the latest federal budget. The move comes as a separate report from the US Treasury Inspector General highlights procedural failures within the IRS Criminal Investigation division regarding the seizure and custody of cryptocurrencies—further underscoring the need for clearer, more consistent federal policies on digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis Introduces Groundbreaking Crypto Tax Reform Bill Amid Frustrations Over Budget Bill Omissions US Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has unveiled a sweeping new draft bill aimed at modernizing the country’s outdated tax framework to accommodate digital assets, after lawmakers once again failed to include crypto-related provisions in the latest federal spending package. The standalone bill proposes a series of reforms long sought by digital asset investors, including a de minimis exemption for small transactions and tax deferrals on mining and staking rewards. The draft legislation, introduced Thursday, seeks to alleviate the mounting tax burden on everyday crypto users and blockchain innovators by carving out specific exemptions for common crypto-related activities. Among the bill’s headline proposals is a de minimis capital gains exemption of $300 per transaction, with a $5,000 annual limit, allowing users to make everyday purchases with crypto without triggering tax reporting obligations. In a statement accompanying the release, Senator Lummis said the bill was “groundbreaking” and designed to bring common sense and clarity to how digital asset activity is taxed in the United States. “This groundbreaking legislation is fully paid for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape, and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world,” said Lummis . “We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation. My legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations.” Beyond the small transaction exemptions, the bill also proposes deferring taxes on mining and staking rewards until the earned digital assets are sold — a move that addresses long-standing complaints that the current tax code unfairly penalizes miners and proof-of-stake validators by treating newly minted tokens as immediate income. Lummis' bill would also exempt crypto lending agreements and digital assets donated to charity from taxation, aligning them more closely with traditional asset treatment. Currently, many crypto users risk facing tax obligations even when using or donating their assets in good faith — a disincentive that critics say hinders broader adoption and philanthropic use of blockchain-based wealth. A Solo Shot After Budget Disappointment The proposal represents Senator Lummis’ latest attempt to deliver on promises made to the cryptocurrency community after crypto-specific tax provisions were left out of the most recent Congressional budget negotiations. Despite bipartisan support for modernizing crypto regulations, the final budget bill moved forward without language addressing the treatment of digital assets. Without a legislative vehicle attached to broader government funding, Lummis’ standalone draft bill now becomes the most realistic path forward for immediate pro-crypto tax reform — but it faces an uphill battle in a deeply divided Senate. Still, industry advocates are applauding the move as a bold step in the right direction. The US crypto community has grown increasingly frustrated over what they describe as “double taxation” and inconsistent treatment of digital assets across jurisdictions and use cases. One of the most contentious issues revolves around decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which operate autonomously and without custodians. Under current interpretations of IRS guidance, users interacting with such protocols could be subject to the same reporting requirements as centralized platforms, despite the lack of a centralized counterparty. This has led to confusion and compliance challenges for retail and institutional users alike. Adding to the complexity, crypto earnings from staking, liquidity provision, or protocol participation can be taxed as income upon receipt, even if the user has not sold or realized any actual profit. In highly volatile markets, this tax timing can result in significant financial losses. DeFi Developers May See Regulatory Relief In a related development, members of the House Financial Services Committee recently proposed an amendment to the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, aiming to exempt developers of decentralized protocols from being classified as money transmitters. This exemption would shield them from burdensome tax reporting rules that currently apply to centralized exchanges. If passed in conjunction with Lummis’ tax bill, the pair of reforms could mark a turning point in how the US treats decentralized platforms, potentially positioning the country as a friendlier jurisdiction for Web3 innovation. Meanwhile, Congressional leaders are scrambling to find a way to incorporate crypto provisions into the final version of the budget bill before it lands on President Donald Trump’s desk. With rising global competition — and more welcoming regulatory frameworks in the EU, UAE, and Hong Kong — pressure is building on US lawmakers to catch up. The crypto industry remains cautiously optimistic. While previous efforts have stalled or been watered down, Senator Lummis’ persistence, combined with growing bipartisan support for digital asset clarity, may finally move the needle. Outlook: A Defining Moment for US Crypto Policy? As the digital asset industry matures, calls for reasonable tax reform and regulatory clarity have grown louder — and more politically urgent. With trillions of dollars in value already flowing through blockchain networks and millions of Americans now holding crypto, the need for a modern tax framework has never been more acute. Senator Lummis’ bill represents a significant step forward, even if it faces procedural hurdles. At a time when innovation is global, many see her proposal as a chance for the US to retain its competitive edge in the digital economy. US Watchdog Criticizes IRS Over Mishandling of Seized Crypto Assets, Calls for Urgent Reforms In related news, a new report from the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has revealed major shortcomings in how the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation division (IRS-CI) manages the seizure and custody of digital assets, adding fuel to growing concerns over the federal government’s ability to securely and transparently handle crypto enforcement cases. The watchdog’s report , published Tuesday, highlights repeated failures by IRS-CI personnel to comply with established protocols for handling confiscated cryptocurrencies between December 2023 and January 2025. The findings raise red flags at a time when the federal government holds one of the largest cryptocurrency stockpiles in the world — estimated at over 200,000 Bitcoin, or more than $21 billion at current market prices. Missing Records and Lax Oversight According to TIGTA’s audit, IRS-CI agents failed to complete or update required seizure memorandums, which are meant to document key details of confiscated digital assets, including wallet addresses, transaction dates, and amounts. The absence of such documentation has left gaps in the official record and raised questions about transparency and accountability. The watchdog emphasized that this failure was not isolated to a single incident but represented a pattern of negligence over a 14-month period. TIGTA's evaluation identified several critical recommendations to fix the deficiencies — all of which were agreed to by IRS-CI leadership. These include: Ensuring IRS-CI personnel understand and adhere to seizure memorandum requirements. Establishing a robust inventory management system to accurately track seized digital assets by quantity, address, and type. Updating internal guidelines to include time frame requirements for preparing seizure memos and for timely updating the inventory system. These reforms, if implemented effectively, could mark a significant shift in how the federal government manages one of the most sensitive and valuable categories of criminally seized assets: cryptocurrency. The report comes at a pivotal moment in US crypto policy. Under President Donald Trump’s renewed term, the administration has revived discussions around establishing a national Bitcoin reserve using digital assets confiscated in criminal cases. While White House officials have floated the idea of converting these holdings into strategic digital reserves, others have proposed alternative acquisition methods, including imposing crypto tariffs or revaluing gold certificates. Regardless of the acquisition method, safe custody of digital assets is a prerequisite for such plans — making the IRS’ missteps particularly alarming. The Scale of Government Crypto Holdings Public interest in the government’s crypto holdings has surged as the value of Bitcoin and other digital assets continues to climb. Based on available data from major criminal seizures, the US government is believed to control approximately 200,000 BTC, although the exact amount may fluctuate with ongoing investigations and asset liquidations. Among the most notable cases: 94,000 BTC from the 2016 Bitfinex hack, seized in 2022. 50,000 BTC tied to the Silk Road darknet marketplace, recovered in separate operations. Other significant seizures from ransomware groups, darknet markets, and fraud schemes. While some of these holdings have been auctioned off in the past, the majority of high-profile Bitcoin seizures in recent years remain under government custody — a responsibility that now appears to be fraught with internal weaknesses.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9807/senator-lummis-proposes-crypto-tax-reforms-as-irs-faces-watchdog-criticism,"REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T14:13:21,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Back In The Red As Rally Stalls At $110,000","Bitcoin (BTC) failed to capitalize on its latest rally as sellers overwhelmed buyers at upper levels. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $110,590 on Thursday, and is down nearly 1%, trading around $108,930. Analysts believe the absence of new buyers and FOMO-driven greed are factors that could keep BTC below $110,000-$112,000 for the time being. Bitcoin Mining Stocks Post Double-Digit Gains Crypto mining stocks registered robust weekly gains despite a brief pullback on Thursday. Stocks rallied thanks to signs of a favorable macroeconomic backdrop that could support the Federal Reserve’s soft landing narrative. Shares of mining firms, including Riot Platforms (RIOT), Hive Digital (HIVE), Hut 8 (HUT8), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Bitfarms (BITF) rallied between 13% and 28% over four trading sessions. US markets closed early on Thursday ahead of the Independence Day weekend. Markets, including public mining companies, responded to a better-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report on Thursday before registering marginal declines. VanEck’s Digital Transformation ETF, which tracks 24 listed digital asset firms, including Coinbase (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR), rose over 3% on Thursday. Bitcoin mining stocks mirrored a broader market rally that saw the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rise to new all-time highs. While the workforce participation has reported a decline, economists have attributed the decline to a crackdown on immigration that may have impacted labor supply. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Cross $600 Million Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported over $600 million in inflows on Thursday, registering their strongest showing in over a month as investors put capital into crypto. The influx helped the ETFs to cross the previous mark of $588 million, reached on June 24. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC recorded for the majority of Thursday’s inflows, registering $224.5 million and $237.1 million. Other ETFs reported smaller inflows, with Ark Invest’s ARKB registering $114,2 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC registered zero net flows. Institutional investors have returned to risk assets like Bitcoin (BTC) due to the anticipation of looser financial conditions under President Trump’s expanded administration policies. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are the primary avenue of exposure to BTC , offering investors regulated assets without the complexities of direct crypto asset ownership. Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Labs, stated, “I think what's driving the ETF flow is the expectation of looser liquidation conditions. It seems risk-on trade is increasingly gaining traction, and for institutions, ETFs are the easiest way to access the Bitcoin exposure.” Can Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Power Bitcoin (BTC) Price Action? Analysts believe Bitcoin (BTC) could gain 40% after President Trump signs the “Big Beautiful Bill” on Independence Day. Crypto investors are eying swift gains as the massive spending bill becomes a reality. The flagship cryptocurrency has historically reacted positively to indications that the US will increase borrowing. The new bill is no exception, with estimates that the US national debt will surge to $40 trillion. The Kobessi Letter, stated in a recent analysis, “To put this into perspective, at the start of 2020, total US debt stood at $23.2 trillion. This would mark a near $17 TRILLION increase in 6 years. Never in history has the US borrowed even remotely near the levels we are borrowing now. This is a crisis.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has retreated during the ongoing session after failing to close above $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp drop at the beginning of the week, falling to a low of $105,328 on Tuesday. However, it recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,845. BTC crossed $109,000 on Thursday, settling at $109,650 after reaching an intraday high of $110,590 before losing momentum during the ongoing session. Crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes believes BTC could move to a new all-time high, but is still likely to test $90,000 this year. Hayes stated in a blog post that the bill, which increases the debt ceiling and cuts taxes, could force the US Treasury to borrow more. President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law on Friday. Hayes argued that the Treasury would refill its General Account, draining liquidity from the markets and impacting the price of assets like BTC . However, he believes BTC will ultimately continue pushing upwards. “Proceed with caution. The bull market might be interrupted for a short period of time.” Hayes previously stated that the central bank’s monetary policy, particularly money printing, could benefit BTC and other cryptocurrencies. BTC’s decline dashes market expectations of a new all-time high, with low spot demand indicating limited upside. BTC’s ability to push to a new all-time high has been limited by a lack of buyers. Market data resource Swissblock Technologies stated in a post on X, “ BTC is breaking out, but where’s the spot demand? Without real demand, breakouts run on fumes. We need buyers to sustain the price breakout.” However, K33 Research highlighted that spot volumes tend to be lower from June to October compared with the rest of the year. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping to a low of $98,385 before reclaiming $100,000 and settling at $100,985. The price recovered on Monday, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settling at $105,443. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC rose 0.66% to $106,137. The price crossed $107,000 on Wednesday, rising 1.19% and settling at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC registered a marginal decline on Thursday, slipping below $107,000 and settling at $106,980. The price recovered over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339.

Currently operated by 16 independent node operators — including Galaxy, Fireblocks, and Antpool — Spiderchain aims to expand to over 100 operators by 2026, ensuring the network’s long-term resilience. This innovative security model not only boosts confidence in the Botanix ecosystem but also places Chainlink’s infrastructure at the centre of Bitcoin’s evolving DeFi narrative. LINK price is stuck in accumulation Despite the strength of this partnership, LINK continues to hover between $12 and $15, reflecting a prolonged period of sideways movement in 2025. CryptoQuant analyst, Banker , attributes this stagnation to a standoff between aggressive whale accumulation and retail disinterest, with whales consistently withdrawing over 100,000 LINK per week from exchanges. Exchange reserves have fallen by 40% year-to-date, while on-chain metrics show flat active address counts and stagnant daily transaction volumes. Wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million LINK now control over 85 million tokens, the highest accumulation level since late 2022. This accumulation suggests that whales are positioning for a breakout, yet the absence of retail participation continues to suppress short-term momentum. Technical analysis points to a potential Chainlink price breakout The LINK chart reflects a coiled pattern, with narrowing Bollinger Bands indicating that a significant move may be imminent. LINK is currently trading just above its 10-day and 20-day moving averages but remains below its 100-day and 200-day lines, which signals hesitancy in long-term positioning. The immediate resistance level is at $14.11, while $13.08 serves as short-term support. Should LINK break above $14.10 with strong volume, it could climb toward the $15 level and possibly retest the $16.77 and $18 resistance zones. A push above the Fibonacci level at $15.64 may open the path toward $18.56, with further upside toward $23.29 and $28.02 if momentum builds. Conversely, if LINK dips below $13, it risks a retreat to $12.50 and potentially further downside to $10.91 or even $9 in the worst-case scenario. Retail participation remains the missing piece While institutional behaviour shows bullish intent, retail investors have yet to reengage with LINK despite major partnerships with Mastercard and the xStocks Alliance. These developments position Chainlink as a key player in tokenized assets and crypto payment infrastructure, but the lack of retail demand has kept prices grounded. Analysts argue that holding above the $12 support level keeps the breakout narrative alive, but a true rally will likely require renewed interest from smaller investors. Until then, LINK’s price is caught between strong accumulation from whales and apathy from the broader market. The Botanix partnership offers a major long-term catalyst, but in the short term, traders must watch for signs of volume and volatility to confirm any breakout.

While institutional flows and corporate accumulation remain primary drivers, the latest push for crypto tax reform in Washington is adding a fresh layer of optimism for long-term adoption. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis recently introduced a comprehensive bill aimed at modernising how crypto is taxed. Key features include exempting transactions under $300 from capital gains tax (capped at $5,000 annually) and delaying taxation on mining or staking rewards until they’re sold. Senator Cynthia Lummis just introduced a major crypto tax reform bill after crypto-related provisions were excluded from the latest federal budget package. $300 de minimis exemption No tax on mining/staking until sold Charity & lending exclusions Aims to end double… pic.twitter.com/d8p6qixWju — Ethos.io (@Ethos_io) July 4, 2025 The proposal also outlines tax breaks for lending and charitable donations and allows mark-to-market accounting for crypto traders, putting digital assets on par with traditional securities. The bill, projected to generate $600 million from 2025 to 2034, could become law amid a friendlier 2025 regulatory environment. If passed, it would simplify crypto use in daily life and lower friction for retail and institutional adoption, potentially setting the stage for broader Bitcoin integration in mainstream finance. Institutions Accumulate BTC Amid ETF Inflows Institutional demand continues to fuel Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. According to SoSoValue, U.S. spot BTC ETFs attracted $769.6 million in inflows this week, marking four straight weeks of net positive flows. That consistency suggests institutional investors are building positions with a long-term view. On the corporate side, MicroStrategy expanded its holdings by acquiring 4,980 BTC, bringing its total stash to 597,325 BTC. Japan’s Metaplanet added 1,005 BTC, and Blockchain Group purchased 60 BTC—demonstrating firm conviction in BTC as a treasury asset. Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick raised his year-end forecast to $200,000, citing accelerating demand and improving macroeconomic conditions. His base case for late 2025 remains $135,000, reinforcing a structurally bullish outlook. Key Institutional Activity: MicroStrategy: +4,980 BTC (597,325 total) Metaplanet: +1,005 BTC U.S. Spot ETFs: +$769.6M inflows this week Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Bulls Hold $108K Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, as the asse t holds above a key ascending trendline drawn from the June 20 low and continues to respect support near $108,000.

2025-07-04T14:08:37,"Hut 8 Explodes Higher, But It's Too Much, Too Quickly","Summary Hut 8 Mining's stock has surged 86% since April, driven by a strong technical uptrend and bullish momentum indicators. Despite the bullish chart, fundamentals have deteriorated sharply, with revenue and earnings estimates slashed across the board. A new Ontario power contract provides long-term cash flow visibility but introduces operational risks and uncertainty in execution. Given the soaring valuation and rising uncertainty, I am downgrading Hut 8 from Buy to Hold—chart strength is offset by weak fundamentals. An interesting phenomenon has occurred with Bitcoin miners in recent years, in that as a group, they’ve largely been diversifying away from Bitcoin mining and into related fields. One such company that has done a lot of that is Hut 8 Mining (HUT) . The last time I covered Hut 8 was in April, and I was quite bullish. The stock is up 86% since then following a blistering rally. Of course, April 3 rd was just before the low in US equities, so a lot of stocks have posted huge gains since then. Still, I’m taking a victory lap with an 86% gain in three months. Does that make the stock expensive today? Sadly, yes it does. I’m a bit torn on Hut 8 now, so I’m moving from Buy to Hold. The Chart Couldn’t Be More Bullish The old saying in technical analysis is that nothing is more bullish than prices going up. There’s been plenty of that with Hut 8 in the last three months, as we can see a beautiful, steep uptrend channel that’s still very much in play today. StockCharts Unless and until that channel is violated, one can reasonably continue to trade it. The steepness of it dictates that it obviously cannot last forever, but so far so good. The stock is ahead of its moving averages, and the latter are trending steeply upwards. From a momentum perspective, I see nothing but validation for the bulls. The PPO has been in positive, bullish configuration for two months and is strengthening again. The accumulation/distribution line has gone straight up since the weeks prior to the April bottom. The RSI looks very similar to the PPO. There are absolutely zero concerns for the chart right now and it’s unequivocally bullish. Support will be the prior relative high at ~$19.50, and/or the rising 20-day EMA, which is currently $18.16 but rising quite quickly. Any price above those levels is still full steam ahead for the bulls. Fundamentals Are A Different Story I place a lot of value in technical analysis, as anyone who has read my work knows. The chart looks great, but I’m afraid the fundamental situation has deteriorated since my April update. Seeking Alpha Revenue and earnings estimates have been obliterated in a short period of time, making the stock much more expensive on any measurement one can think of. All seven revisions in the past three months have been down, and markedly so. Revenue for 2025 is down ~$35 million, and earnings are down from a loss of 27 cents to a loss of $1.60. For 2027, revenue is down $83 million and earnings from $2.47 to 86 cents. These are massive reductions in revenue and earnings estimates, but the curious thing is that the stock has almost doubled. In this kind of situation, either the stock is just tremendously expensive, or Wall Street – the ones with big buying power to move stocks – simply believes estimates will get better over time. In other words, the fundamentals and the price chart are diverging massively, which means one of them is 'wrong'. I’m not interested in the task of trying to guess, but the fact that the chart is quite bullish and estimates just aren’t means I’m neutral. What could change that is the quite sizable news that Hut 8 secured a five-year contract in Ontario to run each of its four natural gas-fired power plants with the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator. The OIESO is a government-backed entity with an AA3 credit rating, meaning the payment risk to Hut 8 is basically nothing. This long-term, highly stable payment stream is terrific for cash flow visibility in the coming years. The agreement is for 310MW of power generation capacity starting on May 1, 2026 at $530 Canadian dollars (~$390 USD) per MW-business day, with the potential for escalations over time. Anyone familiar with Hut 8’s stated strategy will not be surprised by this deal. Investor presentation The company has been focusing on developing its power business, and the Ontario deal is a tremendous success towards achieving that goal. We’ll see how it plays out, but this is exactly what Hut 8 wanted. On the flip side, there are a lot of variables in play that will determine if this venture is ultimately a success. Below we have an example of how Hut 8 accounts for power operations, and there’s a fair amount out of its control. Investor presentation That includes things like the market price and cost of fuel, and to a certain extent, operations and maintenance costs. Now, uncertainty can provide volatility in both positive and negative directions, but before you remortgage your house to run out and buy Hut 8 stock, keep in mind there is a lot that needs to go right between now and May 2031 for this deal to add meaningfully to earnings. I’m not suggesting it won’t happen, but the risk is high and with the share price having exploded higher already, the margin for error is extremely low, in my view. This volatility is exacerbated by the fact that Hut 8’s margins are already extremely volatile. TIKR These are quarterly figures and while we see Hut 8 has done a great job of growing the top line, even gross margins (forgetting about operating margins) have been all over the place. In theory the Ontario deal should help stabilize this. But if there are big fluctuations in some of the variables we looked at above, that may simply make it worse. The company still has Bitcoin mining and compute segments that are also quite volatile. A Soaring Valuation Amid Rising Uncertainty Given that Hut 8 doesn’t have earnings to speak of at the moment, we can try to value it based upon price to forward sales, which is below. TIKR We can see the ramp higher since the April low, which was just over 4X forward sales. We’re at more than double that level now, as the stock price has almost doubled and revenue estimates have gone meaningfully lower. As much as I love the look of the price chart, I simply cannot ignore the fundamental situation including estimates and the valuation. Those two balance each other out; and for me, the stock is a hold today. The chart is too good for a sell rating, but the fundamentals aren’t good enough for a buy rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4799307-hut-8-explodes-higher-but-its-too-much-too-quickly?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|BTC","HUT|HUT:CA",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T14:00:21,"Spot Ethereum ETFs Soar: A Monumental $148 Million Inflow Signals Bullish Momentum","BitcoinWorld Spot Ethereum ETFs Soar: A Monumental $148 Million Inflow Signals Bullish Momentum The world of digital assets is buzzing with excitement as U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs have just marked a significant milestone, recording a combined net inflow of $148.21 million on July 3. This impressive figure, reported by Trader T on X, underscores a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum (ETH) and signals a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. For anyone tracking the evolution of crypto investments, these latest figures are more than just numbers; they represent a powerful vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future and the broader legitimization of digital assets within traditional finance. What Are Spot Ethereum ETFs, and Why Do These ETH Inflows Matter So Much? Before diving into the specifics of the recent capital influx, let’s briefly understand what Spot Ethereum ETFs are and their significance. A Spot Ethereum ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without actually owning the cryptocurrency themselves. This offers a regulated, accessible, and often more secure pathway for traditional investors to participate in the crypto market. The importance of these substantial ETH Inflows cannot be overstated. They signify: Increased Institutional Adoption: Large inflows from major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity indicate that institutional players are increasingly comfortable allocating significant capital to Ethereum. Market Validation: The availability and success of these ETFs provide a stamp of approval from traditional finance, potentially attracting more mainstream investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Greater participation often leads to increased liquidity in the underlying asset, making the market more robust. Potential Price Impact: Sustained inflows can create buying pressure on Ethereum, potentially leading to positive price action for the digital asset. Unpacking the Remarkable $148.21 Million Influx The $148.21 million net inflow on July 3 paints a clear picture of the market’s enthusiasm. While a collective effort, some players stood out remarkably. Here’s a breakdown of the contributions: ETF Net Inflows (July 3) Manager ETHA $85.01 million BlackRock FETH $64.65 million Fidelity Grayscale Mini ETH $3.9 million Grayscale ETHE -$5.35 million (Outflow) Grayscale Remaining ETFs No Change Various This snapshot highlights a concentrated interest from a few major players, particularly BlackRock and Fidelity, which together accounted for the vast majority of the positive flow. Key Players Driving the Momentum: BlackRock ETHA and Fidelity FETH Leading the charge in these impressive ETH Inflows was BlackRock’s ETHA, which alone garnered a staggering $85.01 million in net inflows. BlackRock, a titan in the asset management industry with trillions under management, entering and dominating the Spot Ethereum ETFs space is a monumental development. Their participation lends immense credibility and scale to the nascent crypto ETF market. The sheer volume of capital directed towards BlackRock ETHA suggests a significant institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Following closely was Fidelity’s FETH, securing $64.65 million in net inflows. Fidelity, another well-established financial powerhouse, has consistently shown a proactive stance in embracing digital assets. The strong performance of Fidelity FETH reinforces the narrative that mainstream financial institutions are not just dipping their toes but are actively allocating substantial funds to crypto-backed products. This competition among major players is healthy for the market, driving innovation and potentially offering investors more diverse options. The Grayscale ETHE Dynamic: Outflows Amidst Overall Gains While the overall picture for Spot Ethereum ETFs was overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial to note the unique situation with Grayscale. Grayscale’s ETHE (Ethereum Trust) logged a net outflow of $5.35 million on the same day. This outflow from Grayscale ETHE is not entirely unexpected and mirrors a trend seen with Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) when Bitcoin spot ETFs launched. As Grayscale’s trust products convert into ETFs, some investors may choose to redeem their holdings or shift capital to other, potentially more liquid or lower-fee ETF offerings from competitors like BlackRock or Fidelity. The Grayscale mini ETH, a separate product, did see a positive inflow of $3.9 million, indicating that while their flagship trust experienced redemptions, there’s still interest in their newer offerings. This dynamic is a natural part of market maturation as capital seeks the most efficient and attractive investment vehicles. What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Price and the Broader Crypto Market? The consistent flow of capital into Spot Ethereum ETFs has profound implications. For Ethereum’s price, sustained inflows can act as a significant tailwind, increasing demand for the underlying asset. As ETFs accumulate ETH to back their shares, it reduces the circulating supply available on exchanges, potentially pushing prices higher. This mirrors the impact seen with Bitcoin ETFs, which contributed to Bitcoin’s rally post-launch. Beyond price, these inflows signal a broader shift in market sentiment. They represent a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment assets, moving them further from speculative curiosities and closer to mainstream portfolio components. This institutional embrace could unlock a new wave of capital, not just for Ethereum but for the entire digital asset ecosystem. It validates the foundational technology and the utility of smart contract platforms like Ethereum, paving the way for more widespread adoption and innovation in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. Challenges and Future Outlook for Spot Ethereum ETFs While the outlook is overwhelmingly positive, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. Market volatility remains a factor, and while ETFs provide a regulated wrapper, they are still exposed to the inherent price fluctuations of Ethereum. Regulatory scrutiny, though easing, could still present hurdles for future product launches or expansions. Furthermore, competition among ETF providers will intensify, potentially leading to fee wars that could impact profitability for asset managers, but benefit investors. Looking ahead, the success of Spot Ethereum ETFs could pave the way for similar products for other major altcoins, further diversifying the institutional crypto investment landscape. The sustained growth in ETH Inflows is a strong indicator that institutional capital is here to stay, cementing Ethereum’s position as a cornerstone of the digital economy. This trend suggests a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into traditional financial portfolios, offering new avenues for wealth creation and technological advancement. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The impressive $148.21 million net inflow into U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs on July 3 marks a momentous occasion for the cryptocurrency space. Led by the substantial contributions from BlackRock ETHA and Fidelity FETH , these figures highlight a robust and accelerating institutional interest in Ethereum. While Grayscale ETHE experienced some outflows, the overall picture is one of strong positive momentum, underscoring the increasing mainstream acceptance and validation of digital assets. This significant capital infusion not only strengthens Ethereum’s market position but also sets a promising precedent for the future integration of cryptocurrencies into global financial markets. It’s an exciting time to witness the evolution of digital asset investment, as more traditional avenues open up, bringing liquidity, credibility, and broader participation to this innovative asset class.

Bitcoin Hits Record Quarterly Close Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has achieved a historic milestone by closing the second quarter at its highest level ever, reaching $107,149 on the Bitstamp exchange. This performance follows an 11.6% decline in the first quarter, but Bitcoin rebounded with a 30% gain in the second quarter. Social metrics from LunarCrush and Santiment show a spike in Bitcoin-related engagement following a cryptic tweet from Musk on June 29. The post included a rocket emoji and a dollar symbol—enough to prompt a flurry of interpretations from the crypto community. However, no direct reference to Bitcoin was made. Analysts at CryptoQuant and Kaiko note that while social sentiment surged after the tweet, no significant wallet activity linked to Musk or Tesla has been reported. Bloomberg estimates that BlackRock IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. Glassnode reports that Bitcoin’s 14-day RSI remains under 60, suggesting there’s room for more momentum. Price is holding above its 50-day ($105,970) and 200-day ($87,717) moving averages. Meanwhile, whale activity appears mixed. IntoTheBlock data shows a 45% drop in large BTC transactions over the past month, suggesting some cooling among high-net-worth traders. Still, BTC’s technical posture remains bullish. The network’s health and rising ETF demand suggest fundamental strength rather than hype-driven movement. While Elon Musk’s influence on the market remains a wildcard, current data suggests that his actions do not primarily drive Bitcoin’s momentum.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/is-elon-musk-really-behind-the-bitcoin-buzz-this-time/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk",cryptocompare

Accordingly, Binance TR announced that a waiting period has been introduced for all new crypto asset investments or purchase/sale transactions as of 15:00 on July 4, 2025, in order to increase user security and ensure full compliance with legal obligations. Balances resulting from cryptocurrency transactions made after the specified date will be subject to a 72-hour waiting period. After the first cryptocurrency withdrawal transaction made by users who have completed the 72-hour waiting period, the waiting period for other assets in their account and subsequent crypto investments will be 48 hours. “As of 15:00 on July 4, 2025, a 72-hour waiting period will be applied for the withdrawal of cryptocurrency balances currently in the user's account.

Bitcoin Wallets Move BTC Worth $2 Billion After 14-Year Dormancy","Two dormant Bitcoin whale addresses dating back to the era when Satoshi Nakamoto was still active have been woken up after 14 years. The Bitcoin wallets collectively transferred 20,000 BTC, worth roughly $2 billion, on Friday, creating buzz on social media, with speculation that it was Satoshi’s wallet. The recent movement of Bitcoin whale addresses containing Bitcoin from the 2011 era comes just days after the price of the asset briefly rebounded above $110,000 for the first time since June 11. Satoshi-Era BTC Awakens On April 3, 2011, a Bitcoin wallet starting with “1HqXB” moved 23,377.83 BTC to three different addresses. Two of these wallets each received 10,000 BTC, while the third received the remaining 3,377.83 BTC, according to data tracked by Blockchain.com. The two wallets that received 10,000 BTC each, “1GcCK” and “bc1qm”, have remained dormant for 14 years until early Friday, when they transferred their respective BTC stashes to new addresses within 30 minutes of each other. The third wallet, which received 3,377.83 BTC, had already spent its funds back in 2011. The term “Satoshi era” refers to the early days after Bitcoin was created, when its enigmatic inventor, Nakamoto, was active online in forums. Some Satoshi-era wallets are often speculated to be linked to Satoshi himself. Others on X suggested it could be Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht moving his coins now that he is free after being pardoned by President Donald Trump earlier this year. At the time of the transfers in 2011, the premier crypto was priced at around 78 cents. The two wallets with 10K BTC slept through the Bitcoin bull run and the all-time high of over $111,800 in May 2025. This means that the 20,000 BTC has appreciated by nearly 14,000,000% in value within the 14 years of inactivity, soaring from a mere $7,800 to a staggering $2.18 billion. Whether the wallets belong to the same individual or entity is not confirmed, though the wallet history and transaction patterns suggest that it could be the case. Moreover, the exact reason for the transfer is also unknown at publication time. Nonetheless, the latest transfers were made to non-exchange addresses, which have not moved the coins since — signaling no immediate intention to take profits after over a decade of patiently HODLing.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/satoshi-is-that-you-bitcoin-wallets-move-btc-worth-2-billion-after-14-year-dormancy/,"BTC|TRADING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|satoshi",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T13:50:19,"U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Astounding $603M Inflows, Igniting Market Optimism","BitcoinWorld U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Astounding $603M Inflows, Igniting Market Optimism The world of digital finance is buzzing with exhilarating news as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recently experienced a monumental surge in investments. On July 3, these groundbreaking financial instruments collectively registered a staggering $603 million in total net inflows, a clear indicator of robust and growing interest in the leading cryptocurrency. This significant influx of capital into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is not just a number; it’s a powerful testament to the increasing confidence and institutional adoption shaping the future of the crypto market . A Closer Look: Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows The recent daily data from July 3, as reported by Trader T on X, paints a vivid picture of strong investor appetite. The combined net inflow of $603 million into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a remarkable day for the nascent asset class. Let’s break down which players led the charge: Fidelity’s FBTC: Leading the pack with an impressive $237.13 million in net inflows. Fidelity continues to demonstrate its significant influence in attracting investor capital. BlackRock’s IBIT: Close behind, securing $225.59 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s consistent performance underscores its dominant position in the ETF landscape. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Contributed substantially with $114.25 million in net inflows, showcasing continued interest in ARK’s innovative approach. Bitwise’s BITB: Added a solid $15.53 million, reinforcing its steady presence. Grayscale’s mini BTC: Saw $5.84 million in net inflows, indicating a positive shift even for its smaller fund. VanEck’s HODL: Registered $4.66 million, rounding out the positive contributors for the day. It’s worth noting that the remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, which further highlights the concentrated positive momentum seen across these key funds. These substantial Bitcoin ETF inflows are more than just daily figures; they reflect a growing comfort level among both retail and institutional investors with accessing Bitcoin through regulated financial products. Why Do These Bitcoin ETF Inflows Matter So Much for the Crypto Market? The consistent flow of capital into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs carries profound implications for the entire crypto market . Here’s why these inflows are critical: Price Support and Appreciation: Each dollar flowing into these ETFs typically means more Bitcoin is being purchased by the fund managers to back the ETF shares. This creates constant buying pressure, which can support Bitcoin’s price and potentially drive it higher over time. Enhanced Legitimacy: The approval and subsequent success of these ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have lent significant legitimacy to Bitcoin as an investable asset class. It signals to traditional finance that Bitcoin is maturing and can be integrated into mainstream portfolios. Increased Liquidity: As more capital flows in, the overall liquidity of the Bitcoin market improves. This can lead to more stable price discovery and reduce volatility, making it a more attractive asset for larger investors. Broader Accessibility: ETFs provide a straightforward, regulated, and familiar pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership, such as setting up wallets or managing private keys. This expands the investor base significantly. These factors collectively contribute to a more robust and mature ecosystem for digital assets , with Bitcoin leading the charge. The daily inflow numbers serve as a barometer for investor sentiment and the pace of mainstream adoption. Understanding the Driving Force Behind Institutional Adoption The significant inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are a clear indicator of accelerating institutional adoption . But what exactly is driving this trend? Regulatory Clarity: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs provided a long-awaited regulatory framework, alleviating many concerns that previously deterred large institutions. Knowing they can invest through regulated products reduces compliance risks. Diversification Benefits: Institutions are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a portfolio diversifier. Its low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, particularly during periods of market stress, makes it an attractive addition for risk management. Inflation Hedge Narrative: In an era of persistent inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature are often viewed as a potential hedge against currency debasement, appealing to long-term institutional capital. Growing Market Maturity: The infrastructure supporting the crypto market has evolved significantly, with robust custodians, improved security measures, and more sophisticated trading platforms. This maturity makes institutions more comfortable entering the space. Major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity, with their vast client networks and established reputations, are pivotal in normalizing Bitcoin investments. Their active participation in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs market sends a strong signal to other institutional players, creating a positive feedback loop for further capital inflows. Navigating the Evolving Digital Assets Landscape The success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is not an isolated event; it’s a significant development within the broader, rapidly evolving digital assets landscape. Bitcoin, as the pioneer cryptocurrency, often sets the tone for the wider market. These inflows suggest a maturing perception of cryptocurrencies beyond speculative tools to legitimate investment vehicles. The increasing integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial products like ETFs paves the way for other digital assets . While Bitcoin enjoys the first-mover advantage and the largest market capitalization, the blueprint for regulated investment products could eventually extend to other major cryptocurrencies, contingent on regulatory clarity and market demand. For investors, understanding this evolving landscape means recognizing that: 1. Access is Easier: Getting exposure to crypto is no longer solely for the tech-savvy; it’s becoming as simple as buying a stock. 2. Market Depth is Growing: Larger capital pools mean more robust markets, potentially reducing extreme volatility over the long term. 3. Regulatory Frameworks are Forming: While still nascent, the existence of regulated ETFs indicates a path towards clearer guidelines, which is crucial for mainstream adoption. This dynamic environment presents both opportunities and challenges, requiring investors to stay informed about regulatory shifts, technological advancements, and market sentiment. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin and Investment? The consistent and substantial Bitcoin ETF inflows , like the $603 million witnessed on July 3, paint an optimistic picture for the future of Bitcoin. This sustained buying pressure from regulated investment vehicles could contribute to a more stable and upward trajectory for Bitcoin’s price in the long run. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is not just a fleeting trend but a foundational component of future financial portfolios. Looking ahead, we can anticipate several potential developments: Increased Institutional Allocation: More pension funds, endowments, and corporate treasuries may begin to allocate a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin via ETFs. Development of More Crypto-ETFs: While challenging, the success of Bitcoin ETFs could eventually spur demand and regulatory willingness for ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies, though this is a much more complex regulatory hurdle. Enhanced Financial Products: The success could lead to the creation of more sophisticated financial products built around Bitcoin, further deepening its integration into global finance. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market remains subject to its unique volatilities, regulatory uncertainties, and macroeconomic factors. While inflows are positive, they don’t negate the potential for price fluctuations. Investors should always conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance. Key Takeaways for Savvy Investors The recent surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows offers valuable insights for anyone interested in the digital assets space: Institutional Interest is Real: The numbers don’t lie. Large financial players are actively putting capital into Bitcoin. ETFs are Game-Changers: They have democratized access to Bitcoin for a wider range of investors, bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto. Stay Informed: Daily inflow data, while a snapshot, provides crucial insights into market sentiment and capital flows. Keep an eye on these trends. Long-Term Perspective: While daily fluctuations occur, the consistent positive inflows suggest a strong underlying demand for Bitcoin as a long-term asset. These inflows represent a significant vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s future. They highlight a pivotal moment where digital currencies are increasingly becoming integrated into the fabric of global finance, moving from the fringes to the mainstream. Conclusion: A Bright Horizon for Bitcoin The impressive $603 million in total net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 3 is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and enduring appeal. Led by giants like Fidelity and BlackRock, these significant Bitcoin ETF inflows underscore the accelerating pace of institutional adoption and the maturation of the broader crypto market . As more traditional capital finds its way into digital assets through regulated channels, Bitcoin solidifies its position as a legitimate and increasingly integral part of the global financial landscape. This trend not only signals strong confidence but also paves the way for an exciting and transformative future for digital finance.

DeFi Development has focused its attention on Solana due to its DeFi capabilities and ability to compete with similar tokens, such as Ethereum . DeFi Development now holds 640,585 SOL tokens, valued at approximately $98.1 million. The investment in SOL marks a stark contrast to other companies that mainly invest in Bitcoin. DeFi Development also has an interest in engaging with the Solana ecosystem to enhance its business operations. The latest purchase of 17,760 SOL had an average price of $153.10 per token. DeFi Development will store the tokens as validators for Solana, allowing the company to earn yields. They have even developed their validators to do the compounding independently. Wu Blockchain, a crypto journalist, announced the news online, declaring that DeFi Development was continuing its Solana treasury strategy by purchasing 17,760 SOL tokens. Wu Blockchain also mentioned that DeFi Dev was being consistent with their focus on Solana . DeFi Dev aims to compound their treasury over time by reinvesting SOL tokens as validators for the Solana ecosystem. DeFi Dev is a Nasdaq-listed company that goes under the ticker DFDV. DeFi Dev was proud to announce the new milestone. They have an impressive SOL treasury of nearly $100 million, which may help them continue business operations even during difficult times. A Solana-centric approach dominates the business model of DeFi Dev, with a treasury strategy combined with a staking approach to making profits. DeFi Dev has started its staking process for both internal and external clients. Staking is analogous to Bitcoin mining, as it is a method for generating revenue. The company has chosen Solana as its primary cryptocurrency due to its fast transaction speeds and DeFi capabilities. This is in contrast to Bitcoin’s problematic track record of scalability and limited abilities to program its blockchain. DeFi Dev, however, isn’t the only company investing in Solana. Sol Strategies, a Canadian firm, created a $1 billion prospectus to fund its Solana treasury and expand its validator activities. Solana has become a viable alternative to Ethereum, offering staking capabilities that make it an environmentally friendly option. Solana could also be used to expand services that tokenize real-world assets. The sol-per-share ratio for DeFi Development is currently at 0.042, which translates to $6.65 per share. The metric could help compare various treasury companies to ascertain the relative strength of their treasuries. DeFi Dev has 14,740,779 shares outstanding according to their June 2024 filing. The Solana treasury has been carefully designed to be stored for an extended period, compounding interest through its yields. DeFi Dev has developed a business model based on the principles of compounding, while also offering validation services for the Solana network. DeFi Dev will keep shareholders and stakeholders informed of their treasury performance through regular filings and reports. DeFi Development Corp has become a Solana-centric company, employing various acquisition strategies to purchase more of its common stock and acquire Solana for validation purposes. Such an asset-centric strategy has yet to prove its worth over time. The company has also suggested that shareholders could further use derivatives to hedge their exposure to Solana and optimise their portfolio. DeFi Dev has experienced various setbacks, including a failed SEC filing for $1 billion in funds on June 11, due to a misfiled 10-K form. However, the company has addressed these problems and has continued its treasury strategy. Solana traders may welcome the news of a Solana-based strategy, as it could be added to their portfolio, or they could subscribe to the company’s annual reports.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/nasdaq-listed-defi-development-drops-2-72m-on-solana-now-sits-on-nearly-100m-sol-treasury/,"SOL|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T13:44:04,"S&P 500 rally brings it closer to sell signal: BoFA","While global stocks are likely to continue higher despite fresh tariff concerns, Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett has warned that moves above 6,300 for the S&P 500 could trigger a “sell signal.” Bank of America strategists said in a research report that investors have allocated significant funds into cash and bonds in recent days, even as stocks rallied to record highs. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite edged higher as markets welcomed the easing of Middle East tensions and positive sentiment driven by macroeconomic tailwinds. Fresh trade war risks The S&P 500 has had a stunning past few weeks, with a notable stocks bounce in May seeing the benchmark index hit new record highs as it closed at 6,279.35 on Thursday. Major U.S. indices advanced on better-than-expected payrolls data before markets closed for the July 4 Independence Day holiday. Although upward momentum may persist into next week, analysts caution that a continued rally could place the S&P 500 on the edge of a sell signal. This outlook coincides with renewed concerns over trade policy, as President Donald Trump’s recent tariff remarks have brought trade war risks back into focus. With the 90-day tariff pause nearing its end , some investors are adopting a more cautious stance. Hartnett suggests that if the current optimism holds and the S&P 500 surpasses the 6,300 mark in the coming weeks, a period of selling could be imminent. As well as the extended rally, BoFA strategists say bubble risks are growing, particularly after Congress approved Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ – a policy and tax bill featuring a $3.4 trillion package. You might also like: Senator Cynthia Lummis introduces crypto tax bill S&P 500 near “bubble or burst” scenario According to Bank of America researchers, the market is approaching a critical juncture they describe as a “bubble or bust” scenario. In their assessment, the likelihood of the S&P 500 rallying to 7,000 this summer outweighs the probability of a sharp decline to 5,000. “Overbought markets can stay overbought as greed is harder to conquer than fear,” Hartnett wrote. The bank also reported that investors funneled more than $56 billion into money market funds last week, while bonds attracted over $20 billion in weekly inflows through July 2. Equities recorded net inflows of $2.2 billion, with gold attracting $1.4 billion and cryptocurrency funds drawing more than $1 billion. The surge into digital asset investment funds came as Bitcoin ( BTC ) briefly spiked above $110,000 before pulling back below the key psychological level.

If this structure of successive higher highs and higher lows continues, it could signal that a new uptrend is forming, with buyers gradually regaining control of the market.

Dogecoin Open Interest (USD) starts July on uptrend. Source: Coinglass, DOGE Derivatives. These Derivative traders appear to be positioning for a continuation, with a long/short ratio of 2.92 on Binance showing that over 74.5% of its users are betting on price increases. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Is This the Start of a 3x Move? The development highlighted by Trader Tardigrade on the daily chart feeds into the broader breakout setup of a massive 4-year cup-and-handle pattern. This emerging uptrend aligns with historical support stretching back to Mid-2024, creating a potential confluence zone for a breakout as it meets the upper resistance of the handle. If the reversal sequence holds, the historical support could be a breakout launchpad for the pattern’s $0.75 technical target—a 3.45x gain from current levels. Momentum indicators support this outlook. The RSI continues trending higher, holding above 40, signaling that sellers are gradually losing control. More so, the MACD line is approaching a bullish cross above the signal line for the first time since early June. On the 3-day timeframe, this often signals the early stages of a new mid-term uptrend. However, for this 3.45x move to fully materialize by the end of the year, a market-warming social or fundamental catalyst like the October 17 U.S. spot DOGE ETF decision deadline will likely play a key part.

A rejection here risks confirming a false breakout, putting pressure on the historical support. If this level is lost, the next major support level lies 45% lower at the mid-2024 market bottom around $0.09. Bitcoin Could be the Bigger Play – With Some Help Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With almost $2 million in its third presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 410% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

Is the PI Network credible for gains? Many might be wondering this at this point. However, with token unlocks lined up for the next 30 days and weak utility factors contributing to lower adoption, positive views are overshadowed by bearish sentiment. This clearly indicates that PI could be approaching its final shattering point. If it loses support near $0.477, it could slide to an all-time low of $0.40, raising the odds for the PI Network to descend further into the abyss. Conversely, if the token unlocks meet the right demand and drive utility-driven adoption, only then does it have a chance of survival in the industry.

With up to 4x leverage and even zero interest under certain conditions. On top of that, Binance has hired a former Central Bank of Ireland executive to lead its work in Europe and the UK. Binance Institutional Loans – With 0% Interest In a recent tweet post, Binance CEO Richard Teng announced that the company is launching “Binance Institutional Loans,” a product that allows large clients to borrow against their entire portfolio using multiple accounts. Unlike regular loans, these are cross-collateralized and offer much more flexibility. It lets big clients borrow $1 million to $10 million in USDT or USDC using multiple accounts as collateral. They can use over 400 crypto assets, including BTC, ETH, BNB, and SOL, to back the loan. These loans offer more flexibility than regular ones and don’t cut extra value from popular coins. If clients meet certain trading goals, they could even pay 0% interest, which means big savings for high-volume traders. [post_titles_links postid=”478653″] Who Are Eligible For The Loan To qualify, users must be corporate clients ranked VIP 5+ or companies that Binance assesses individually. Supported collateral includes BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, and popular stablecoins. These borrowed funds can then be used for margin and futures trading on Binance with up to 4x leverage. Binance’s new loan service offers fast trading and flexible credit for top-tier clients. Verified companies can borrow quickly by linking approved accounts, with near-instant trade speeds. New Leader for Europe and UK Along with the loan launch, Binance also appointed Gillian Lynch as its new Head of Europe and the UK. Lynch previously worked at Gemini and the Central Bank of Ireland, giving her a solid background in both crypto and traditional finance. Her job will be to lead Binance’s strategy and daily work in Europe, while also talking with local regulators and governments. Binance says this move is part of its plan to grow safely, follow the rules, and protect users.
