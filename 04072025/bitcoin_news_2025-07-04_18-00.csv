2025-07-04T15:50:12,"Lorenzo Protocol: Pioneering USD1+ Fund Debuts on BNB Chain Testnet","BitcoinWorld Lorenzo Protocol: Pioneering USD1+ Fund Debuts on BNB Chain Testnet The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, with innovation driving new possibilities for asset utilization. A significant stride in this direction comes from Lorenzo Protocol , a pioneering platform dedicated to enhancing Bitcoin’s utility. Their recent deployment of the groundbreaking USD1+ fund on the BNB Chain testnet marks a pivotal moment, signaling a new era for Bitcoin liquidity and on-chain fund finance. This move promises to unlock unprecedented opportunities for yield generation within the Bitcoin ecosystem, merging traditional finance with the dynamic world of decentralized finance. What is Lorenzo Protocol and Its Vision for Bitcoin Liquidity? Lorenzo Protocol is not just another DeFi project; it’s a dedicated Bitcoin liquidity finance platform designed to unlock the immense potential of Bitcoin beyond its role as a mere store of value. For years, Bitcoin has been the king of cryptocurrencies, but its native blockchain isn’t inherently designed for complex decentralized applications. This has led to solutions like wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) to bring BTC liquidity to other chains, but Lorenzo Protocol aims for a more native, efficient approach to leverage Bitcoin’s power. The core vision of Lorenzo Protocol revolves around creating a robust infrastructure that allows Bitcoin holders to participate in various yield-generating activities directly, without necessarily moving their assets off the Bitcoin network or relying solely on wrapped versions. By focusing on “Bitcoin liquidity,” Lorenzo seeks to build bridges that allow BTC to flow seamlessly into diverse financial instruments and strategies, ultimately enhancing its utility and appeal for a broader range of investors. This initiative is crucial for the burgeoning BTCFi (Bitcoin Finance) ecosystem, aiming to provide a comprehensive suite of financial services built directly on or around Bitcoin. Key Aspects of Lorenzo Protocol’s Vision: Unlocking Dormant Capital: Billions of dollars in Bitcoin sit idle. Lorenzo aims to put this capital to work. Native Bitcoin Integration: Developing solutions that are as close to native Bitcoin interaction as possible, reducing reliance on centralized custodians or complex wrapping mechanisms. Diversified Yield Opportunities: Providing access to a variety of income streams for Bitcoin holders, moving beyond simple lending. Building BTCFi Infrastructure: Contributing to the overall growth and maturity of the Bitcoin decentralized finance ecosystem. Decoding the Revolutionary USD1+ Fund At the heart of Lorenzo Protocol’s latest announcement is the USD1+ on-chain traded fund (OTF) . This isn’t your average crypto fund; it represents a novel approach to combining diverse income streams into a single, transparent, and accessible investment vehicle. Backed by World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin, the USD1+ fund is engineered to provide stable returns by diversifying its strategies across multiple financial landscapes. The structure of the USD1+ fund is particularly intriguing because it draws income from three distinct yet complementary sources: Real-World Assets (RWA): This component bridges the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance. Income from RWAs could include yields generated from tokenized real estate, treasury bills, private credit, or other tangible assets that are brought onto the blockchain. This provides a layer of stability and uncorrelated returns, often appealing to investors seeking refuge from crypto volatility. Quantitative Trading Strategies: This involves sophisticated algorithms and automated systems that execute trades based on predefined rules and market analysis. These strategies can range from arbitrage and market making to trend following, aiming to generate consistent returns regardless of market direction. The “quant” aspect brings a professional, data-driven approach to fund management. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The fund also taps into the vibrant DeFi ecosystem. This could involve participating in yield farming protocols, providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), engaging in lending/borrowing protocols, or utilizing other innovative DeFi primitives to generate yield. This component offers exposure to the high-growth potential of the crypto native space. Returns generated by the USD1+ fund are paid out in USD1, a stablecoin, ensuring that investors receive their income in a predictable, non-volatile asset. This multi-faceted approach aims to create a robust and resilient fund, offering a compelling proposition for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio with a yield-generating asset that transcends typical crypto-only strategies. Why BNB Chain? The Strategic Deployment on BNB Chain Testnet The choice of BNB Chain for the deployment of the USD1+ fund ‘s testnet is a strategic one, reflecting several key advantages that the blockchain offers. A “testnet” is essentially a replica of a blockchain’s main network, designed for developers to test new features, applications, and smart contracts without risking real funds. This environment is crucial for identifying bugs, optimizing performance, and gathering community feedback before a full mainnet launch. BNB Chain , formerly Binance Smart Chain, has emerged as a formidable player in the blockchain space, known for its: High Transaction Throughput: BNB Chain can handle a large volume of transactions per second, making it efficient for dApps that require quick processing. Low Transaction Fees: Compared to some other major blockchains, BNB Chain typically offers significantly lower gas fees, making it more cost-effective for users and developers. EVM Compatibility: Being Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible means that developers can easily migrate or build dApps using familiar tools and languages (like Solidity), fostering a robust developer ecosystem. Large User Base: BNB Chain boasts a massive and active user base, thanks in part to its association with Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This provides a fertile ground for new protocols to gain traction. Deploying the USD1+ fund on the BNB Chain testnet allows Lorenzo Protocol to rigorously test the fund’s smart contracts, ensure the seamless integration of its various income-generating components, and validate its operational efficiency in a live, albeit simulated, environment. This phase is critical for ensuring the security, stability, and reliability of the USD1+ fund before it goes live on the mainnet, where real capital will be involved. The strategic choice of BNB Chain underscores Lorenzo Protocol’s commitment to accessibility, efficiency, and reaching a broad audience. The Broader Impact: Enhancing Bitcoin Liquidity and BTCFi The deployment of the USD1+ fund by Lorenzo Protocol is more than just a new product; it’s a significant step forward in the ongoing quest to enhance Bitcoin liquidity and mature the broader Bitcoin Finance (BTCFi) ecosystem. For years, Bitcoin’s primary role has been as a digital store of value, often sitting dormant in wallets. While its price appreciation has been significant, its utility within the decentralized financial landscape has been somewhat limited compared to other programmable blockchains like Ethereum. The challenge has always been how to make Bitcoin “work” in DeFi without compromising its security or decentralization. Solutions like wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) have allowed BTC to be used on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains, but these often involve custodial risks or a departure from Bitcoin’s native environment. Lorenzo Protocol, by focusing on Bitcoin liquidity finance, is aiming to create more direct and secure pathways for BTC holders to engage with yield-generating opportunities. The USD1+ fund contributes to this by: Creating a Yield-Bearing BTC-Adjacent Asset: While returns are paid in USD1, the underlying strategies aim to utilize Bitcoin or Bitcoin-derived liquidity. This allows BTC holders to indirectly benefit from diversified strategies. Showcasing Interoperability: The deployment on BNB Chain highlights the growing trend of multi-chain strategies and the need for seamless asset flow between different blockchain ecosystems. Attracting New Capital to BTCFi: By offering a professionally managed, diversified fund, Lorenzo Protocol can attract institutional and retail investors who are hesitant to directly engage with complex DeFi protocols but are keen to put their Bitcoin to work. This initiative underscores a crucial evolution in the crypto space: the transition from simply holding Bitcoin to actively leveraging it as a productive asset within a sophisticated financial ecosystem. As BTCFi continues to grow, solutions like Lorenzo Protocol’s USD1+ fund will be instrumental in unlocking trillions of dollars in dormant Bitcoin capital. The Future of Finance: Understanding the On-chain Fund Revolution The concept of an “on-chain fund” is a paradigm shift in asset management, moving away from traditional, opaque, and often costly financial structures towards a more transparent, efficient, and accessible model. The USD1+ on-chain traded fund (OTF) exemplifies this revolution, demonstrating how blockchain technology can fundamentally reshape how investment vehicles are created, managed, and accessed. What makes an on-chain fund revolutionary? Feature Traditional Fund On-chain Fund (e.g., USD1+ OTF) Transparency Limited visibility into holdings, fees, and performance. Full transparency of assets, transactions, and performance on a public ledger. Accessibility High minimum investments, geographical restrictions, accredited investor requirements. Lower barriers to entry, global accessibility, fractional ownership possible. Efficiency/Costs High management fees, numerous intermediaries, slow settlement. Automated via smart contracts, reduced fees, near-instant settlement. Liquidity Often illiquid, redemption periods. Potentially higher liquidity through tokenization and secondary markets. Composability Stand-alone, difficult to integrate with other financial products. Modular, can be integrated into other DeFi protocols and dApps. The USD1+ OTF , by operating entirely on the blockchain, eliminates many of the inefficiencies and trust requirements inherent in traditional finance. Smart contracts automate the fund’s operations, from asset allocation to return distribution, minimizing human error and potential for manipulation. This level of automation and transparency builds trust and reduces operational overhead, potentially leading to better net returns for investors. The rise of on-chain fund s signifies a broader trend towards democratizing finance. It allows individuals worldwide to access sophisticated investment strategies that were once exclusive to institutional investors. As regulations evolve and blockchain technology matures, we can expect to see more diverse and complex on-chain funds emerge, further blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance and solidifying the blockchain’s role as the infrastructure for the future of asset management. Benefits and Actionable Insights for Investors The deployment of the USD1+ fund offers several compelling benefits for various types of investors: Diversified Yield: For Bitcoin holders, this presents an opportunity to earn yield from a mix of RWA, quant strategies, and DeFi, reducing reliance on single-asset exposure. Stablecoin Returns: Receiving returns in USD1 provides predictability and stability, mitigating the volatility often associated with crypto assets. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: The RWA component offers a familiar investment avenue for traditional investors looking to dip their toes into the crypto space with a managed fund. Transparency: The on-chain nature means investors can verify transactions and fund activity, fostering greater trust. Actionable Insights: Monitor Testnet Progress: Keep an eye on Lorenzo Protocol ‘s updates regarding the testnet phase. Successful testing is a strong indicator for mainnet launch. Research USD1 Stablecoin: Understand the backing and stability mechanisms of World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin. Evaluate Risk Appetite: While diversified, all investment funds carry risk. Assess if the fund’s strategies align with your risk tolerance. Stay Informed on Regulations: The landscape for on-chain fund s and RWA is evolving. Staying updated on regulatory developments is crucial. Challenges and Considerations on the Horizon While the prospects for the USD1+ fund and Lorenzo Protocol are exciting, it’s essential to consider potential challenges: Smart Contract Risk: Despite rigorous testing, smart contracts are susceptible to bugs or exploits. Audits are crucial but not foolproof. Market Volatility: While diversified, the DeFi and quant components are still exposed to cryptocurrency market volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for on-chain fund s and RWA is still developing globally, which could impact operations. Adoption and Liquidity: The success of the fund will depend on widespread adoption and sufficient liquidity for its underlying assets and the USD1 stablecoin. Centralization Concerns: While an “on-chain fund,” the degree of decentralization in its management and governance will be a key factor for long-term sustainability. Lorenzo Protocol will need to navigate these challenges carefully, prioritizing security, transparency, and community engagement to build lasting trust and ensure the fund’s long-term viability. The Road Ahead for Lorenzo Protocol The deployment on the BNB Chain testnet is just the beginning for the USD1+ fund and Lorenzo Protocol . The next critical phase will involve comprehensive testing, gathering community feedback, and iterating on the protocol to ensure robustness and user-friendliness. Following a successful testnet period, the anticipation will build for a mainnet launch, which will allow real capital to flow into the fund. Looking further ahead, Lorenzo Protocol’s commitment to enhancing Bitcoin liquidity suggests a roadmap that could include: Integration with more blockchains to broaden accessibility. Development of additional yield-generating products tailored for Bitcoin holders. Exploring decentralized governance models for the protocol and its funds. Forging strategic partnerships within both the traditional finance and decentralized finance sectors to expand its reach and offerings. The journey of transforming Bitcoin from a dormant store of value into a dynamic, yield-generating asset is a long one, but Lorenzo Protocol is clearly positioning itself at the forefront of this evolution. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Bitcoin’s Potential Lorenzo Protocol ‘s deployment of the USD1+ fund on the BNB Chain testnet is a truly significant development, heralding a new era for Bitcoin liquidity and the broader on-chain fund landscape. By innovatively blending real-world assets, quantitative trading, and decentralized finance strategies, the USD1+ fund offers a compelling, diversified yield opportunity for investors eager to put their Bitcoin to work. This move not only expands the utility of Bitcoin but also underscores the growing maturity and sophistication of the decentralized finance ecosystem.

2025-07-04T15:41:52,"Solo Bitcoin miner wins full block reward of ‎3.173 BTC","A solo Bitcoin miner won the full block reward of ‎3.173 BTC using a small-scale mining rig with 2.3 petahash per second (PH/s). Mempool Space website showed that the solo miner known as Solo CK won a total of $349,028 worth of Bitcoin subsidy and fees after solving block number 903,883. The miner netted ‎3.10918096 BTC, equivalent to $338,105 after paying the pool’s fees of 0.06345267 BTC. The miner won the Bitcoin block reward through the CKpool platform while running hardware with a hashrate of 2.3 PH/s. The CKpool dev and admin, Con Kolivas, posted about the achievement of the solo miner on X and congratulated him. Source: Con Kolivas This solo miner beat incredible odds At around 2.3 PH/s, Solo CK controlled a tiny fraction of the global Bitcoin network hashrate, which ranges between 600 and 700 EH/s (exahash per second). Statistically, this translates to a ~0.004% chance per day of finding a block—which equates to Con Kolivas’ calculation of “once every 8 years” average. The log output shared by the CKpool admin on X showed that the solo miner’s rig averaged ~2.3 PH/s over the past hour and between ~2.17 to 2.22 PH/s over the past 1 to 7 days prior to solving the block. This average hashrate is considered high for a solo miner, suggesting a powerful setup roughly equivalent to the output of 10 Antminer S21 units. The log also showed that the block difficulty was at 941 trillion, and the solo miner submitted about 79.6 trillion shares (or attempts) before solving the block. This equates to 68% of the expected effort needed to solve a Bitcoin block, meaning the solo miner solved the block earlier than average. Solo miners solved many Bitcoin blocks this year This is not the first time a solo miner hits the jackpot and takes the full Bitcoin block reward. In February 2025, a solo miner solved block number 883,181 and won 3.125 BTC block, which was worth over $300,000. A Bitcoin miner said on X that the winner used an implementation of the CKPool and speculated the usage of Bitaxe. In March another solo miner solved block number 887,212 and won around 3.15 BTC, equal to $263,000 at the time. Con Kolivas shared the news on X and said the miner used a 480 GH/s Bitaxe device to solve the block with a hashrate of just 3.3 TH/s on CKpool. Such a miner has less than a 1-in-a-million chance of finding a block per day — meaning, on average, it would take about 3,500 years to discover one. Bitaxe is a DIY open-source Bitcoin miner often used by hobbyists. It’s made with a single ASIC chip , typically from the Antminer S9 series and has a hashrate of around 480 GH/s. On June 5th, a solo miner won $330,000 after mining block number 899,826 and getting 3.125 BTC. The miner obtained the block rewards through the CKpool and used a high hashrate of 259 PH/s, which is based on a rental basis from a cloud service.

2025-07-04T15:30:50,"Bitcoin Bull Run: Cathie Wood’s Bold Prediction for Continued Growth","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Bull Run: Cathie Wood’s Bold Prediction for Continued Growth The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with renewed optimism, and at the heart of this excitement is a resounding declaration from one of the most influential voices in finance: Cathie Wood. The CEO of ARK Invest, known for her visionary insights into disruptive innovation, recently asserted that the Bitcoin bull run is far from over. This bold statement, shared on the ‘In the Know’ podcast and amplified across crypto news channels, signals a powerful conviction in Bitcoin’s continued ascent. For anyone tracking the volatile yet exhilarating journey of digital assets, Wood’s perspective offers a compelling reason to look beyond short-term fluctuations and embrace the larger narrative of growth. Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Truly Unstoppable, According to Cathie Wood? Cathie Wood ‘s recent remarks underscore a deep-seated belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, echoing the sentiments that have positioned ARK Invest as a prominent proponent of the leading cryptocurrency. Her statement, “We’re still in the bull market for Bitcoin,” isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a strategic outlook rooted in extensive research and a unique investment philosophy. For years, Wood has championed Bitcoin as a transformative asset, often likening it to ‘digital gold’ and a hedge against inflation. Her conviction stems from Bitcoin’s finite supply, its decentralized nature, and its growing adoption as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin operates outside the purview of central banks, offering a unique proposition in an increasingly uncertain global economic landscape. This perspective suggests that the current upward trajectory of the Bitcoin bull run is not merely a speculative frenzy but a fundamental revaluation of a revolutionary asset. What Fuels ARK Invest ‘s Enduring Optimism for Bitcoin? ARK Invest ‘s approach to Bitcoin is characterized by a forward-thinking, innovation-centric lens. Their research delves into the core drivers of Bitcoin’s value proposition, moving beyond simple price charts to understand the underlying technological and economic shifts it represents. Several key factors contribute to ARK’s sustained optimism: Scarcity and Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. Periodic ‘halving’ events, which reduce the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, create built-in scarcity, often preceding significant price appreciation. The upcoming halving in 2024 is widely anticipated as a major catalyst. Institutional Adoption: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has opened the floodgates for institutional capital, providing a regulated and accessible pathway for large investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This influx of sophisticated money is a significant legitimizing force. Network Effects and Security: As more users and developers join the Bitcoin network, its utility and security strengthen. The decentralized and robust nature of the blockchain ensures its resilience against censorship and manipulation. Disinflationary Hedge: In an era of increasing global debt and potential currency debasement, Bitcoin is viewed by ARK as a potent hedge against inflation, offering a predictable and sound monetary policy. This comprehensive view forms the bedrock of ARK Invest ‘s long-term bullish stance, distinguishing their analysis from short-term trading narratives. How is the Broader Crypto Market Influencing Bitcoin’s Trajectory? While Bitcoin often leads the charge, its performance is inextricably linked to the broader crypto market . The overall sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the digital asset ecosystem all play a role in shaping Bitcoin’s path. The current market environment is characterized by several influential trends: Market Trend Impact on Bitcoin Current Relevance Spot Bitcoin ETFs Facilitates institutional and retail investment, increasing liquidity and legitimacy. Massive inflows observed post-approval, signaling strong demand. Macroeconomic Climate Interest rate decisions, inflation data, and global stability affect risk appetite. Uncertainty can drive investors towards perceived safe-havens like Bitcoin. Technological Innovation Developments in blockchain, DeFi, and NFTs can attract new users and capital. Evolving use cases enhance the overall utility and appeal of digital assets. Regulatory Landscape Clearer regulations can foster trust and accelerate mainstream adoption. Ongoing discussions and frameworks are shaping the future of the market. The collective strength of the crypto market , driven by these interwoven factors, creates a fertile ground for Bitcoin’s continued expansion. As the ecosystem matures, Bitcoin benefits from increased infrastructure, liquidity, and broader acceptance. Beyond Speculation: What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Action? Understanding the current Bitcoin price action requires looking beyond mere speculation. While short-term trading certainly plays a role, fundamental drivers are increasingly dictating its long-term trajectory. Bitcoin’s price is a function of supply and demand, influenced by a confluence of factors: Demand from New Investors: The ease of access provided by ETFs has brought a wave of traditional investors who previously found direct crypto ownership daunting. Whale Accumulation: Large institutional holders and high-net-worth individuals continue to accumulate Bitcoin, indicating long-term confidence. Diminishing Supply: With each halving event, the rate of new Bitcoin entering the market decreases, making existing supply more valuable if demand remains constant or increases. Global Macro Trends: As central banks grapple with inflation and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as an alternative asset that can preserve purchasing power. These drivers suggest that the recent surge in Bitcoin price is not just a fleeting trend but potentially the early stages of a more sustained upward movement, consistent with Cathie Wood’s bullish outlook. What are Cathie Wood ‘s Key Insights for Navigating Bitcoin’s Volatility? While Cathie Wood is unequivocally bullish on Bitcoin, she also acknowledges the inherent volatility of disruptive assets. Her insights extend beyond simple price predictions to offer a framework for investors to navigate the often-turbulent waters of the crypto space. Key takeaways from her philosophy include: Long-Term Horizon: Wood consistently advocates for a long-term investment horizon, emphasizing that the true potential of disruptive technologies like Bitcoin is realized over years, not months. Short-term fluctuations should be viewed as noise rather than a fundamental shift in trend. Focus on Innovation: ARK Invest’s core thesis revolves around identifying and investing in innovation. For Bitcoin, this means understanding its foundational technology, its role in the future of finance, and its potential to disrupt traditional systems. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For individual investors, a strategy of dollar-cost averaging can help mitigate the impact of volatility by investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This allows investors to accumulate more Bitcoin when prices are lower. Research and Conviction: Wood stresses the importance of conducting thorough research and developing strong conviction in one’s investments. Understanding Bitcoin’s value proposition helps investors remain calm during market downturns. Her advice provides a robust framework for those looking to participate in the ongoing Bitcoin bull run , encouraging a disciplined and informed approach. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights The convergence of Cathie Wood’s optimistic forecast, ARK Invest’s rigorous research, and the evolving dynamics of the broader crypto market paints a compelling picture for Bitcoin’s future. For investors, this translates into several actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the crypto space. Consider Long-Term Allocation: If Bitcoin aligns with your investment goals, consider a strategic, long-term allocation rather than attempting to time the market. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is a leader, a diversified portfolio within crypto and across asset classes can help manage risk. Security First: Always prioritize the security of your digital assets through reputable exchanges, hardware wallets, and strong authentication practices. The narrative around Bitcoin is shifting from a speculative gamble to a legitimate asset class with growing institutional acceptance. This evolution, strongly supported by figures like Cathie Wood, suggests that we may indeed be witnessing a sustained period of growth. A Future Forged in Digital Gold Cathie Wood ‘s unwavering confidence in the continuation of the Bitcoin bull run serves as a powerful affirmation for investors and enthusiasts alike. Her perspective, backed by the deep analytical work of ARK Invest , highlights Bitcoin’s fundamental strengths and its increasing integration into the global financial system. As the crypto market matures and new catalysts emerge, the narrative of Bitcoin as a transformative asset gains further traction. The journey of the Bitcoin price may be marked by volatility, but the long-term outlook, according to one of finance’s most astute minds, remains profoundly optimistic. We are, as Wood suggests, still very much in the midst of an exciting and potentially rewarding chapter for Bitcoin.

Here's Why!""","As the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) gradually approaches its previous ATH of around $111,700, it is wondered whether it can maintain this upward momentum. At this point, some analysts state that the recent movements in BTC indicate an accumulation phase before the rise, while some analysts argue that BTC has peaked and the bull will end. One of these analysts was Rekt Capital. Rekt Capital said in its latest analysis that Bitcoin's rise and bull cycle could end within three months. The Bull May End in October! Crypto analyst Rekt Capital said that if Bitcoin follows a similar pattern to its 2020 cycle, there are only a few months left for the price to rise in the current bull cycle. The analyst noted that the current bull run could end within the next three months, with the cycle likely to peak this October. At this point, the analyst noted that if the Bitcoin cycle follows the 2020 pattern, the market will likely peak in October, 550 days after the Bitcoin halving in April 2024. “We potentially have two to three months left in this bull market.” This prediction from Rekt Capital contradicts other estimates suggesting that the current bull market could extend into 2026. On this point, the analyst argued that many analysts are ignoring the halving cycle and historical patterns. “Many people are happy to throw away time-tested principles, but it is really important to trust such criteria. But recently, the historically more reliable halving metric has been sidelined in favor of a new narrative like Bitcoin’s correlation with the global M2 Money Supply.” *This is not investment advice.

That sweep was followed by a strong bullish engulfing candle, signalling aggressive buying interest from that zone. The price has since reclaimed the 100-day moving average and is currently testing the 200-day MA and the descending resistance of the multi-month descending channel around $2.40. A clean breakout above this zone could open the door toward the $3 resistance cluster. If momentum continues, bulls may even eye a rally toward the major supply area near $4. However, failure to break this structure could result in another retracement back to the $1.60 demand zone. If that level breaks again without a new higher high, the structure would remain bearish. The RSI at 58 is also neutral-bullish, supporting a short-term continuation move, but not yet signalling overbought conditions. Source: TradingView The BTC Pair XRP/BTC is still trading inside the descending wedge and hasn’t confirmed a breakout yet. The pair is hovering just beneath the wedge’s upper boundary and the key resistance zone at 2100 SAT, which is just below the 100 and 200 EMAs. Despite several attempts to push higher, it has failed to break and close above this confluence. Until that happens, the downtrend structure remains intact, and the wedge is still in play. If a rejection follows, we could see another drop toward the lower boundary near 1800 SAT. Moreover, the RSI sitting around the neutral 50 level signals indecision, making a confirmed breakout or rejection crucial for the next move.

2025-07-04T15:13:03,"Why are Bitcoin and altcoins going down today?","Bitcoin and most altcoins declined on Friday, July 4, as investors booked profits, trade jitters resurfaced, and expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut diminished. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped to $107,800, retreating sharply from this week’s high of $110,200. Leading the losses among altcoins were SPX6900 ( SPX ), Ethena ( ENA ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), and Pepe ( PEPE ). Bitcoin and altcoins likely dropped because of the recent US nonfarm payrolls jobs data and their implications to the Federal Reserve. In a report on Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the economy added 147,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2%. The figures were better than the expected addition of 100,000 jobs and contrasted with the ADP report, which had indicated a loss of over 33,000 private-sector jobs. The unemployment rate was also lower than forecasts, which had projected a rise to 4.3%.

Bitcoin and other altcoins do well when there are hopes of interest rate cuts. The crypto market also pulled back as the July 7 deadline for new tariffs approached. President Donald Trump has so far reached agreements with China, Vietnam, and the UK, but deals with key trading partners including Japan, South Korea, and the European Union remain unresolved. This raises the risk of an extended trade war. Bitcoin and other crypto tokens crashed in April after the Liberation Day speech and then bounced back after Trump announced the three-month pause to allow for negotiations. Bitcoin and altcoins dropped because of the US holiday and profit-taking The U.S. Independence Day holiday also contributed to a decline in trading activity, adding to downward pressure on digital assets. According to CoinMarketCap, 24-hour trading volume fell 33% to $94.57 billion. The decline appears partly driven by profit-taking, as traders locked in gains from the recent rally. Several of the week’s best performers, including Pudgy Penguins, Bonk, Fartcoin, and Dogwifhat, were among Friday’s top laggards. Still, the ongoing retreat could be temporary since Bitcoin has strong fundamentals, with ETF demand rising and supply on exchanges falling. It has also formed a cup-and-handle and a bullish flag pattern, pointing to a rebound in the near term.

2025-07-04T15:12:52,"Bitcoin’s Breakthrough: Could BTC Price Target $120,000 by July?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Breakthrough: Could BTC Price Target $120,000 by July? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation! A bold new forecast from crypto services provider Matrixport has sent ripples across the market, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price prediction could see the leading digital asset soar to an astonishing $120,000 as early as this month. For many investors, this raises a crucial question: is this an achievable target, or just another speculative whisper in the wind? Let’s dive deep into the factors fueling this optimistic outlook and what it could mean for the future of the crypto landscape. Unpacking Matrixport’s Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction In a recent update shared on X, Matrixport, a prominent name in crypto financial services, laid out a compelling case for a significant upside movement in Bitcoin’s value. Despite sustained institutional accumulation and robust inflows into Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), BTC has largely remained within a trading range. This prolonged consolidation often tests investor patience, yet Matrixport sees it as a coiled spring, ready to unleash substantial gains. Their analysis points towards an upside potential ranging between $116,000 and a staggering $120,000. What makes this Matrixport Bitcoin prediction particularly intriguing is the specific timeline: “as early as this month.” This suggests a belief in rapid price appreciation, driven by a confluence of technical and fundamental indicators that they believe are aligning for a powerful breakout. It’s a testament to the dynamic nature of the crypto market, where periods of calm can swiftly give way to explosive volatility. Why is BTC Price Target Set So High? Key Drivers Several underlying factors contribute to Matrixport’s confident BTC price target . Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the potential trajectory of Bitcoin: Strong ETF Inflows: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has been a game-changer, opening the floodgates for traditional finance to access Bitcoin. Consistent net inflows into these products demonstrate sustained institutional demand, signaling long-term conviction in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Even during periods of sideways price action, these inflows have provided a solid demand floor. Sustained Institutional Accumulation: Beyond ETFs, various institutions, including corporations, asset managers, and even sovereign wealth funds, continue to accumulate Bitcoin. This steady accumulation removes supply from the open market, creating scarcity that can drive prices higher when demand surges. Decreased Volatility and Market Maturity: Perhaps one of the most telling indicators cited by Matrixport is Bitcoin’s volatility dropping to multi-year lows. While some might interpret low volatility as a sign of stagnation, in mature markets, it often precedes significant price movements. It suggests that Bitcoin is becoming less susceptible to wild speculative swings and more aligned with traditional asset behaviors, indicating increased market maturity. This stability can attract even more conservative institutional capital. Bitcoin in July: A Historical Look at Seasonal Trends One of the fascinating aspects of Matrixport’s analysis hinges on historical patterns. The report highlights that Bitcoin July performance has historically been robust, with an impressive average return of 9.1% for the month. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, seasonal trends can sometimes offer valuable insights into market psychology and capital flows. If these historical seasonal trends hold true, and combined with the current building capital inflows, Matrixport believes Bitcoin is poised to breach crucial resistance levels. Breaking past these technical barriers, often psychological as well as chart-based, could trigger a cascade of buying interest, propelling the price towards their ambitious $116,000 to $120,000 range. It’s a scenario where history rhymes, amplified by contemporary market dynamics. Navigating the Crypto Market Analysis: Challenges & Opportunities While the prospect of Bitcoin reaching $120,000 is exciting, a balanced crypto market analysis requires acknowledging potential challenges and opportunities. No prediction is without its risks, and smart investors always consider both sides of the coin. Potential Challenges: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic factors, such as interest rate changes, inflation data, or global geopolitical events, can significantly impact investor sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory attention or unexpected policy shifts in major economies could introduce uncertainty and dampen enthusiasm. Sudden Supply Shocks: While less likely, large sell-offs from whales or unforeseen events impacting major exchanges could temporarily disrupt the market. Actionable Insights for Investors: Risk Management: Always invest only what you can afford to lose. Volatility, even when decreasing, remains a characteristic of the crypto market. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider a strategy of regular, smaller investments rather than a single large lump sum, to mitigate the impact of short-term price fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and fundamental developments. Understanding the narratives driving the market is key. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a dominant force, consider diversifying your crypto portfolio to spread risk. The Road Ahead: Will Bitcoin Break New Ground? The latest forecast from Matrixport presents a compelling narrative for Bitcoin’s near-term future. The convergence of strong institutional demand, a maturing market, and historically favorable seasonal trends paints a picture of significant upside potential. While the journey to $120,000 may encounter its share of twists and turns, the underlying fundamentals suggest that Bitcoin is indeed entering a new phase of its evolution. Whether it hits the $120,000 mark by July or takes a little longer, the discussion around such ambitious targets underscores the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these key indicators will be paramount for anyone navigating the exciting world of digital assets.

2025-07-04T15:00:00,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $0.7827 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.5823 Market Cap $21 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $677 Million Circulating Supply 45 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.6105 24-hour Low $0.5806 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.23% 50-day SMA $ 0.669534 14-Day RSI 47.74 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day chart on July 4, Cardano (ADA) is currently exhibiting bearish momentum. The price is trading below the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.6536) and nearing the lower band at $0.5829, suggesting continued downward pressure. RSI is at 33.26, approaching oversold territory, indicating weakening buyer interest. If ADA breaks below the $0.5829 support level, further decline toward the $0.55 or even $0.50 zone is possible. A short-term recovery would require a bounce above $0.6536 with increased volume and RSI climbing above 40. Overall, the trend remains bearish unless key resistance levels are reclaimed and market sentiment shows signs of reversal. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart for Cardano (ADA), the asset is exhibiting signs of weakening bullish momentum. Despite a minor price rebound toward $0.58, the Bollinger Bands are starting to narrow, indicating decreasing volatility. The MACD line is above the signal line but shows signs of convergence, hinting at potential bearish crossover if momentum fades. Additionally, the Balance of Power indicator reads -0.84, signaling dominant selling pressure in the short term. ADA must hold the $0.53 support zone to avoid deeper retracement. A confirmed breakout above $0.58 could reignite upward momentum, targeting resistance near the $0.63 level. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 0.591013 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.604081 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.586336 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.598662 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.669534 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.677483 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.612612 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 0.611091 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.635019 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.654165 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.669998 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.710588 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.747892 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.722727 SELL What to expect from Cardano price analysis next Cardano (ADA) shows mixed signals across the 4-hour and 1-day charts, reflecting cautious optimism amid prevailing bearish pressure. On the 1-day chart, ADA is trading near $0.58 with Bollinger Bands widening slightly, suggesting growing volatility, while the RSI remains below 50, indicating weak buying strength. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart shows ADA facing resistance at $0.58 with the MACD approaching a bearish crossover and a strongly negative Balance of Power, signaling selling dominance. Unless ADA breaks above $0.63 with volume support, short-term recovery remains fragile. A drop below $0.53 support could deepen the correction, while consolidation may define the near-term outlook. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $5.97, with an average trading price of about $5.17 and a minimum price of $5.03. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano will reach $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $5.97. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $7.33 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $8.61. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.5823, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

2025-07-04T14:54:42,"Could AI Agents Create a New Crypto Economy?","Agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of initiating, negotiating, and executing tasks with minimal human input, is poised to redefine the global economy by enabling machine-to-machine (A2A) interaction, real-time decision-making, and autonomous participation in digital markets. Unlike traditional generative AI, agentic systems operate continuously and adaptively, facilitating complex coordination without human bottlenecks. Their integration with decentralised financial infrastructure, such as cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and real-time payment layers (like Lightning), makes them ideal participants in a new machine-speed economic paradigm that traditional institutions are ill-equipped to support. These agents are expected to take on roles across finance, logistics, asset management, and cross-border payments, with the potential to create entirely new market behaviours. As agentic AI converges with blockchain, forming programmable, trust-minimised digital institutions, it not only automates existing workflows but also enables new economic models. Will Lightning Network or another digital asset underpin the Agentic AI economy? What is Agentic AI and What Impact Will it Have on the Economy? Agentic AI represents a new frontier in artificial intelligence, one in which autonomous agents are capable of initiating, negotiating, and executing tasks with minimal or no human input. Unlike generative AI, which relies on human prompts, agentic systems can operate continuously and adaptively, learning from experience and collaborating with other agents to solve complex, multi-step problems. In economic terms, this introduces a profound shift: AI agents are beginning to interact with one another in real time, forming the basis of an “Agent-to-Agent” (A2A) economy . As these interactions scale, they promise to reshape entire industries by reducing human bottlenecks, increasing responsiveness, and enabling machine-led economic coordination on a global scale. The implications for financial services and broader economic infrastructure are significant. AI agents will not merely assist in decision-making, they will transact autonomously, continuously adjusting to real-time data and executing agreements faster than human systems allow. Traditional financial rails, however, are ill-suited to meet the demands of this new agentic paradigm. Settlement systems that take days, rely on intermediaries, or require manual oversight cannot support the volume, speed, or autonomy necessary for agents operating at machine speed. Bureaucratic friction, latency, and institutional risk thresholds render legacy financial systems inadequate for the emerging economic logic driven by AI agents. Instead, decentralised technologies such as cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and real-time payment layers like the Lightning Network are increasingly positioned to fill this infrastructural void. These systems offer the programmability, trust minimisation, and instant settlement mechanisms required for autonomous economic activity at scale. Smart contracts can enforce rules without external arbitration; cryptocurrencies enable global, permissionless transactions; and Web3 primitives offer composability and interoperability that legacy systems lack. Such tools are not just optional upgrades but foundational requirements if agentic AI is to function independently and securely in the digital economy. Cloudflare’s announcement of its “ pay per crawl ” system marks a watershed moment in the transition to an agentic AI economy, introducing programmable monetisation at the protocol level for AI interactions with web content. Given that Cloudflare powers a significant portion of today’s Internet infrastructure, protecting and accelerating millions of websites and applications, its move to enforce payment for AI crawlers represents not just a policy shift, but a foundational redesign of how value flows through the digital ecosystem. By enabling content creators to charge AI agents per request using HTTP 402 and cryptographic authentication, Cloudflare is laying the groundwork for autonomous machine-to-machine economic activity, where intelligent agents can negotiate and transact for data access in real time. This transforms AI crawlers from passive extractors into active economic participants, aligning with a broader evolution where AI agents aren’t just consuming information, but operating as self-governing actors within a monetised web. In doing so, Cloudflare has effectively activated one of the Internet’s dormant features and turned it into a keystone mechanism for the emerging A2A economy. Integrating payment infrastructure such as Bitcoin’s Lightning Network or a Web3 alternative, could dramatically assist Cloudflare in achieving this goal by enabling instant, low-cost, and programmable micropayments at machine speed and global scale. Looking ahead, the convergence of agentic AI with decentralised finance is likely to transform the architecture of economic interaction. As AI agents evolve from reactive tools to autonomous market participants, they will require environments that allow for trustless, high-frequency, and borderless engagement. The infrastructure best suited to facilitate this is not institutional finance, but rather cryptographic systems designed for open access and machine-level execution. In this context, cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based protocols are not peripheral to the future, they are central to enabling the A2A economy to operate at the speed and complexity that agentic systems demand. In What Kind of Economic Activity Could AI Agents Participate? AI agents are expected to play an increasingly autonomous and central role in a wide range of economic activity, from customer service and supply chain logistics to asset management and cross-border payments. Current forecasts by institutions such as the World Economic Forum , the IMF , and leading AI researchers project that agentic AI will move from augmenting human labour to independently conducting transactions, managing data pipelines, and optimising business processes in real time. This shift will significantly affect sectors where high-frequency decision-making and dynamic pricing are crucial, such as finance, e-commerce, and infrastructure provisioning. The automation of such economic functions could reduce costs, enhance efficiency, and operate at a scale and speed beyond human capability. A particularly important area where agentic AI is forecast to drive disruption is in the convergence of traditional finance, Fintech, and decentralised Digital Assets. As financial institutions experiment with programmable money and embedded services, AI agents are likely to become intermediaries between legacy institutions and decentralised networks. These agents could, for instance, autonomously allocate capital between regulated markets and DeFi protocols, conduct risk assessments, or even negotiate insurance contracts based on real-time inputs. The fusion of AI and finance will thus not merely digitise existing processes, it will redefine what financial decision-making looks like, particularly as regulatory frameworks begin to accommodate non-human economic actors. This transformation will be accelerated by infrastructure developments such as instant settlement layers, streaming payments, A2A economic activity, and smart contracts. Technologies like Bitcoin’s Lightning Network or Ethereum’s Layer 2 rollups (Or even another throughput optimised Web3 chain like Solana!) allow transactions to be settled in milliseconds at low cost, a critical requirement for AI agents operating across machine-speed economic cycles. Streaming payments, where funds are transmitted continuously in real time, could enable new types of microservices where AI agents pay each other by the second for data access, compute cycles, or API calls. Smart contracts will underpin these arrangements by ensuring deterministic execution of complex rules, enabling trust-minimised coordination between agents without human involvement or dispute resolution mechanisms. Ultimately, the kinds of economic activity AI agents might participate in are not limited to replicating human workflows, they will likely create entirely new market behaviours and transaction models. Use cases may emerge that are difficult to predict from our current human-centred vantage point: AI agents dynamically assembling synthetic supply chains, bidding for data access in real time, or forming temporary “coalitions” to solve distributed optimisation problems. These are not merely enhancements of existing commerce but indications of a new economic layer driven by autonomous negotiation, execution, and feedback among digital agents. As this paradigm matures, traditional economic theory itself may need revision to account for a class of participants that do not rely on labour, experience, or even currency in the human sense, but instead operate according to logic, incentives, and continual adaptation. What Kind of Advances Are Being Made to Merge the AI & Digital Asset Worlds? The convergence of AI and digital assets marks a paradigm shift in both technology and economics, ushering in a new era where software agents are not merely tools, but active participants in economic systems. One of the most significant advances lies in the development of autonomous AI agents that can manage their own digital identities and interact with blockchain-based financial infrastructure. By leveraging cryptographic keys and smart contracts, these agents can execute transactions, negotiate terms, and even co-manage decentralised services alongside humans. This model bypasses the friction and gatekeeping of traditional financial institutions, enabling agents to act independently in blockchain-based environments such as decentralised exchanges, lending platforms, or payment networks. The potential productivity boost from these self-sovereign digital actors is enormous, particularly when aligned with decentralised protocols that eliminate reliance on intermediaries. Another key innovation is the use of blockchain as a new kind of economic institution, one that is machine-readable, programmable, and trust-minimised. Traditionally, AI has faced barriers in executing economic decisions due to the human-centric nature of contracts, the complexities surrounding compliance processes like Know Your Customer (KYC), and jurisdictional legal frameworks. Blockchain tech offers a workaround by providing digitally native infrastructures where smart contracts and verifiable computation replace paper-based agreements and subjective arbitration. As a result, AI agents can not only analyse but also enact decisions, transforming them from passive recommendation engines into active economic participants. This opens up new pathways for industries like supply chain logistics, insurance, and finance to automate complex workflows and delegate them to goal-oriented AI systems capable of self-improvement and dynamic decision-making. The evolution of agentic AI, especially vertical AI agents designed for specific industries, represents another frontier. Unlike general-purpose assistants, these systems are goal-directed and deeply integrated with domain-specific datasets. They operate autonomously to achieve end-to-end outcomes, for example, sourcing inventory across global supply chains or managing capital allocation in real time. Tools like Alibaba’s Accio AI agent illustrate how these systems combine natural language processing with real-world data integration to streamline sourcing, procurement, and RFQ issuance, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in emerging markets. These vertical AI agents represent a structural shift in business operations, allowing even resource-constrained firms to compete globally with decision-making capabilities that rival large enterprises. However, these advances also raise important governance and security concerns. Granting AI agents control over private keys and economic actions introduces new risks around accountability, misalignment, and systemic exploitation. To mitigate these, developers are building guardrails like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure agents reason from vetted data, and incorporating layered key management, audit trails, and programmable oversight. Equally important are efforts to integrate participatory governance models and human-in-the-loop systems to balance automation with human values. As AI and digital assets continue to merge, success will depend not just on technical innovation, but on building transparent, auditable, and inclusive ecosystems that support both human flourishing and machine agency.

Market volatility has been lower on Friday, in part due to the nation July 4th holiday in the U.S. Bitcoin attempted to form a new record high on Thursday but fell just short, sliding from $111,000 to $108,000, with the majority of altcoins like ATOM following its lead. Technical analysis ATOM-USD experienced a notable decline of $0.17 (3.95%) during the 24-hour period from 3 July 15:00 to 4 July 14:00, with price dropping from $4.22 to $4.06. The asset established a clear downtrend after failing to maintain support at $4.17, with high-volume selling emerging at the $4.09 level. Volume spiked to 588,338 units during the 7:00 hour on July 4th—significantly above the 24-hour average. Multiple attempts to establish support near $4.07 have been rejected, suggesting continued bearish momentum. During the 60-minute period from 4 July 13:06 to 14:05, ATOM-USD declined by $0.03 (0.61%), dropping from $4.09 to $4.06. A brief recovery attempt occurred at 13:53 with price reaching $4.07, but momentum failed to sustain as sellers returned. The pattern of lower highs and lower lows confirms continuation of the broader bearish trend approaching the psychological $4.00 support level. CD20 Index Plunges 2% as Crypto Market Sentiment Deteriorates The CD20 index has experienced a notable bearish trend over the last 24 hours from 3 July 15:00 to 4 July 14:00, declining from $1,803.70 to $1,765.27, representing a substantial drop of $38.43 or 2.13%. The overall range of $38.84 (2.15%) highlights persistent selling pressure, with particularly accelerated downward momentum in the final hours as the index reached its lowest point of $1,764.86 at 14:00, suggesting deteriorating market sentiment despite brief consolidation attempts around the $1,780 level.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/04/atom-tumbles-4-as-sellers-target-critical-usd4-support-level,"MARKET|TRADING|ATOM|ALTCOIN|BTC","Markets|AI Market Insights|News",cryptocompare

The news comes roughly a week after Pi Day, an event held by the development team in which they shared with the community some new features and updates. Pi has been criticized for its lack of ecosystem growth initiatives following the launch of its public mainnet in February. This collaboration with Zypto could help ease the decline that Pi Coin has experienced lately as its supply has been expanding rapidly. Pi Coin Price Prediction: PI Could Rise to $0.57 If This Key Support Holds In the past 7 days, Pi Coin has retreated by more than 12% but seems to have found strong support at $0.4750. The token has already bounced two times off this level and could be entering a phase of accumulation ahead of further ecosystem news. In the 4-hour chart, the price has moved off its falling wedge but not with sufficient strength to confirm a bullish breakout. Both the 9-day and 21-period exponential moving averages (EMAs) remain on a downtrend while the token is trading below its 200-day EMA as well. The $0.4750 is the most critical level to watch for Pi as a drop below this area could push the token to a new all-time low. This Zypto announcement favors a bullish Pi Coin price prediction as it could help PI in bouncing off this area and retest the $0.57 target shown in the chart. A full recovery to $1 seems difficult at the time, especially as Pi’s daily token unlocks will continue to be quite high during the next couple of weeks or so according to data from PiScan . However, as the rate at which its supply is expanding decreases, the market could start to assign more weight to this kind of announcement. While Pi continues to struggle, Bitcoin-linked crypto presales are gaining traction. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is a standout example, having already raised over $8 million and attracting growing investor interest. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Hands Over Rewards Based on How Bitcoin Performs Bitcoin is currently trading at $110,000, bringing it closer to the first reward milestone set by BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) — a meme coin designed to reward Bitcoin holders with passive income. BTCBULL’s unique system offers two types of incentives: Bitcoin airdrops and token burns. The structure is simple. Starting from a $100,000 BTC baseline, new rewards are unlocked every time Bitcoin gains another $25,000. At $125,000, a portion of BTCBULL’s supply will be permanently burned, reducing circulation and potentially boosting the token’s price. Next up, once the top crypto reaches $150,000, token holders will receive a direct BTC airdrop in their wallets where they hold BTCBULL in correspondence to the number of tokens that they hold. To buy $BTCBULL, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

2025-07-04T14:50:41,"Belgian Court Jails Trio 12 Years for Crypto Investor’s Wife Kidnapping—Masterminds Still at Large","A court in Brussels has sentenced three men to 12 years in prison for the December 2024 abduction of the wife of Belgian crypto investor and content creator Stephane Winkel. The sentencing, handed down on Thursday, comes as European authorities face a rising number of crypto-linked kidnapping cases. According to prosecutors, the group snatched Winkel’s wife outside their home on December 20 and forced her into a van registered in France. The attackers then attempted to flee toward the Belgian coast. Winkel immediately contacted the police, triggering a swift response. Officers intercepted the van near Bruges, forcing it into a ditch and arresting the three adults inside. A fourth suspect, a minor, was referred to juvenile court. Three Jailed in Winkel Kidnapping, But Crypto Plot’s Masterminds Still Unknown Local media outlet La Dernière Heure reported that the kidnappers were convicted of hostage-taking and attempting to extort cryptocurrency as ransom. During the trial, the defendants claimed they had been acting under threat from unnamed “sponsors” who would have killed them if they refused. The court dismissed this version of events, describing the crime as a deliberate and professional hostage operation. Le verdict est tombé : 12 ans de prison ferme pour les ravisseurs de mon épouse.

While the court has now sentenced those who physically carried out the act, the broader investigation remains active, and officials have yet to identify the masterminds behind the operation. In addition to prison time, the court also ordered the convicted men to pay over €1 million (around $1.2 million) in damages to the victim. Winkel and his wife, who were deeply shaken by the event, have since relocated for safety reasons. Winkel, a well-known figure in the Belgian crypto space, runs educational platforms including Crypto Académie and Crypto Sun. He also operates a YouTube channel with nearly 40,000 subscribers, where he previously offered wallet demonstrations, market commentary, and contests. Following the attack, Winkel stepped back from public appearances. In a January post on X , he wrote, “I consider myself a defender of freedom, but I now realize that safety must become an absolute priority for me and those around me.” Récapitulatif de l'enlèvement : On est le vendredi 20 décembre, 10 heures du matin : une camionnette avec quatre individus à bord a fait irruption dans ma rue et a enlevé de force ma femme.

J’ai vu la… — Stéphane | Crypto Académie (@StephaneWinkel) January 6, 2025 He pledged to return to crypto education, but with a different approach, one that avoids personal exposure and high-risk demonstrations. “No more contests or wallet demonstrations,” he said, instead promising to focus on market analysis and user protection. Winkel reappeared on YouTube in late June, releasing his first video since the incident. This time, the video featured only voiceover narration, no on-camera presence. While the sentencing marks progress in the case, authorities continue their search for those believed to have orchestrated the plot. The Belgian police confirmed that investigations are ongoing into what they describe as an expanding network behind a series of targeted kidnappings in the European crypto sector. Global Wave of Crypto-Related Kidnappings Intensifies The case of the Belgian family is not an isolated incident. Around the world, crypto investors with public profiles are becoming prime targets in a disturbing trend of high-stakes abductions. A recent report noted that Australian crypto billionaire Tim Heath, last July, narrowly escaped a kidnapping attempt in Tallinn, Estonia. Heath, founder of Yolo Group, was ambushed by two men posing as painters.

Court records revealed the attackers had tracked Heath’s movements using a GPS device and planned to transport him to a rented sauna house to force a crypto transfer. France has seen a similar spike. In June, a TikTok crypto influencer was abducted and beaten in Essonne after attackers demanded €50,000 in crypto. When his attackers found his wallet nearly empty, they released him. Days later, another man was held hostage in Paris while his kidnappers demanded his Ledger wallet and cash. His partner was coerced into handing over €5,000 before he was freed.

2025-07-04T14:50:36,"Bitcoin Plunge Warning: Analyst Predicts Bearish Shift Below $108K","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Plunge Warning: Analyst Predicts Bearish Shift Below $108K The world of cryptocurrency is a constant whirlwind of volatility and opportunity. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding the intricate dance of digital asset prices is paramount. When a seasoned crypto analyst issues a stark warning, the market tends to listen. Recently, a significant alert has emerged concerning Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, suggesting a potentially dramatic shift in its market trajectory. Is Bitcoin on the Brink? Understanding the $108,000 Threshold Daan Crypto Trades, a well-regarded voice in the crypto analysis space, has pointed to a critical juncture for Bitcoin . According to a report by Cointelegraph, the analyst suggests that if BTC fails to hold the crucial $108,000 support level, the market could witness a definitive bearish turn. This isn’t just an arbitrary number; in technical analysis, specific price points often act as psychological or structural barriers that dictate future movements. A breach of such a level can signal a significant change in market sentiment and momentum. What makes this particular threshold so vital? In trading, support levels are price points where a downtrend is expected to pause due to a concentration of demand. If demand at this level is insufficient to absorb selling pressure, the price can ‘break’ through, often leading to accelerated declines as stop-loss orders are triggered and new sellers enter the market. The $108,000 mark appears to be one such line in the sand for Bitcoin ‘s current consolidation phase. The Curious Case of Current BTC Consolidation One of the key insights from Daan Crypto Trades is that the current consolidation pattern of BTC looks somewhat different from its predecessors in this market cycle. Consolidation typically refers to a period where an asset’s price trades within a relatively narrow range, indicating a balance between buying and selling pressure before a decisive move. Historically, Bitcoin has often consolidated before significant upward trends. The analyst explains that while the pattern still follows the general blueprint – where it ‘stalls, deviates below, retakes the range and then grinds higher’ – there’s a crucial missing element: ‘the actual breakout and continuation.’ This suggests that while Bitcoin has shown resilience in bouncing back into its range, it hasn’t demonstrated the strong follow-through buying pressure needed to propel it into a sustained upward trend. This lack of conviction from buyers, combined with persistent selling pressure at higher levels, creates a precarious balance. Without a clear breakout, the risk of a downside move intensifies, making the $108,000 level even more precarious. Key Characteristics of Current BTC Consolidation: Stalling: Price action has paused its upward momentum. Deviation Below: Brief dips below expected support levels occur. Retaking the Range: Price manages to recover and re-enter the previous trading range. Grinding Higher (or Sideways): Slow, often unconvincing upward movement or prolonged sideways trading. Missing Element: Lack of a strong, decisive breakout and sustained continuation. The Ominous Bearish Outlook: What Happens Below $108,000? The implications of Bitcoin failing to hold the $108,000 support are significant. According to the analyst, such a failure could pave the way for a drop below the psychologically important $100,000 mark once again. This isn’t just about a few thousand dollars; breaking a major round number like $100,000 can trigger widespread panic selling and a loss of confidence among retail and institutional investors alike. A move below $100,000 could lead to a cascading effect, where further support levels are tested and potentially broken. This scenario would firmly establish a bearish trend, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, increased volatility, and potentially longer periods of decline. For traders, this means shifting strategies from seeking long opportunities to looking for short positions or simply staying on the sidelines. For long-term holders, it could mean enduring deeper drawdowns and a test of conviction. Potential Market Reactions to a Break Below $108,000: Increased Selling Pressure: Traders with stop-loss orders below $108,000 would exit their positions. Psychological Impact: A break below $100,000 could trigger FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) across the market. Liquidation Cascades: Leveraged positions could face margin calls and forced liquidations, accelerating the decline. Altcoin Impact: Historically, when Bitcoin experiences significant drops, altcoins tend to follow, often with even greater percentage losses. Shift in Market Sentiment: A prevailing optimistic sentiment could quickly turn negative, leading to reduced participation and investment. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Price Prediction While the analyst’s warning paints a cautious picture, it also provides valuable information for informed decision-making. Understanding potential support and resistance levels, as well as market patterns, is crucial for developing a robust trading or investment strategy. Here are some actionable insights for navigating these uncertain times: Monitor the $108,000 Level Closely: This is the immediate key. Watch how Bitcoin reacts if it approaches or tests this level. Strong bounces would indicate resilience, while swift breaks would confirm the bearish outlook. Risk Management is Paramount: If you are actively trading, consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the price drops. For long-term investors, ensure your portfolio is diversified and you are not over-leveraged. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, a bearish turn could present opportunities to accumulate at lower prices. DCA involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, which averages out your entry cost over time. Stay Informed, But Filter Noise: Follow reputable analysts like Daan Crypto Trades, but always cross-reference information and conduct your own research. The crypto market is rife with speculation and misinformation. Prepare for Volatility: Bitcoin’s price action is notoriously volatile. Be mentally prepared for significant swings in either direction and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term price movements. Look for Confirmation: Don’t act on a single signal. Wait for clear confirmation of a trend reversal or continuation before making significant moves. For instance, a break below $108,000 followed by a sustained period below it, perhaps even breaking $100,000, would be stronger confirmation of a bearish trend than a brief wick below. Beyond the Immediate Warning: Broader Market Context It’s important to remember that Bitcoin’s price is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond technical analysis alone. Macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and global economic stability, play a significant role. Regulatory developments, institutional adoption news, and even major geopolitical events can all sway market sentiment. For instance, increasing institutional interest and the approval of new investment vehicles can provide significant upward momentum, while stricter regulations or negative headlines can trigger sell-offs. The upcoming Bitcoin halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, are also historically significant drivers of bull markets, though their impact is often delayed and complex. Understanding this broader context helps in forming a more holistic price prediction . While a technical analyst might highlight a specific price point, the underlying fundamentals and external forces often dictate the strength and duration of any trend. The Resilience of Bitcoin : A Historical Perspective While a potential bearish turn is concerning, it’s also crucial to remember Bitcoin’s history of resilience. The cryptocurrency has weathered numerous bear markets, significant price corrections, and periods of intense skepticism, only to emerge stronger. Each major downturn has historically purged weaker projects and over-leveraged participants, paving the way for more sustainable growth. This historical perspective doesn’t negate the immediate warning but serves as a reminder of Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Short-term volatility and bearish phases are inherent to nascent, high-growth markets. For long-term investors, these periods can often be seen as opportunities rather than existential threats, provided one has a sound investment strategy and conviction in the asset’s future. Concluding Thoughts: Staying Vigilant in a Dynamic Market The warning from Daan Crypto Trades serves as a timely reminder of the delicate balance in the cryptocurrency market. The $108,000 level is undeniably a critical point for Bitcoin , and its ability to hold this support will likely dictate its immediate future. A failure to do so could usher in a significant bearish phase, potentially seeing BTC drop below $100,000. As always, informed decision-making, robust risk management, and a long-term perspective are your best allies in navigating the unpredictable waters of digital assets. Whether Bitcoin holds strong or succumbs to selling pressure, the market will continue to evolve, presenting new challenges and opportunities for those who are prepared.

2025-07-04T14:47:14,"Spustenie Solana ETF na staking prekonalo očakávania: meme coiny vyskočili o viac ako 20 %","V stredu 2.7.2025 došlo k spusteniu úplne prvého Solana ETF . Fond s názvom REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF od spoločnosti REX Shares sa začal obchodovať na americkej burze CBOE . Vďaka tomuto produktu môžu investori profitovať z rastu ceny SOL a zároveň získať pasívny príjem za staking. Nejde tak len o historicky prvé Solana ETF schválené v USA, ale aj o prvé americké ETF s funkciou staking . Pozrite sa, ako prvý deň obchodovania hodnotia analytici a ako na spustenie ETF zareagovali najväčšie coiny v ekosytéme Solana. Preskúmať projekt Snorter Prvý deň obchodovania Solana ETF dopadol úspešne Podľa Jamesa Seyffarta , analytika spoločnosti Bloomberg , zaznamenal nový Solana ETF fond na staking už počas prvých 20 minút objem obchodov vo výške 8 miliónov dolárov . Podľa Seyffarta tak išlo o „zdravý začiatok obchodovania“. Fond nakoniec uzavrel prvý deň s prílivom kapitálu vo výške 12 miliónov dolárov a objemom obchodov 33 miliónov dolárov . Ako uvádza Eric Balchunas , ETF analytik rovnakej spoločnosti, objem obchodov výrazne prekonal aj Solana futures ETF aj XRP futures ETF . Na druhej strane dodáva, že išlo o nižší objem, než pri spustení spotových ETF na Bitcoin a Ethereum . Len pre porovnanie, počas prvého dňa obchodovania Bitcoin ETF sa obchodovali podiely vo výške 4,6 miliárd dolárov . Seyffart však uvádza, že za nižší objem obchodov môže do určitej miery aj skrátený obchodný týždeň , počas ktorého je obchodná aktivita všeobecne nižšia. V USA sa 4. júla oslavuje Deň nezávislosti. „ Vidíme, že po týchto produktoch bude určite dopyt, “ dodáva analytik. Trhová kapitalizácia na sieti Solana stúpla o 7 % Spustenie Solana ETF spôsobilo okamžitý nárast ceny SOL o približne 2 % . Podľa zdrojov CoinMarketCap sa trhová kapitalizácia ekosystému Solana za posledný týždeň zvýšila o takmer 7 % s aktuálnym objemom 193 miliárd dolárov . Celkový denný objem obchodov narástol za rovnakú dobu až o 35 % , čo svedčí o vysokom dopyte po digitálnych aktívach na sieti Solana. Zdroj: coinmarketcap.com Najvyššie zisky si pripisujú populárne meme coiny . Za posledných 7 dní narástol Bonk o viac ako 27 % a Fartcoin si pripísal 26 % . Hodnota meme coinu Dogwifhat narástla o takmer 20 % a PopCat si prilepšil o približne 23 % . Zo spustenia Solana ETF profitovali aj AI tokeny. Príkladom je Virtuals Protocol , natívny token decentralizovanej platformy, ktorá umožňuje jednoduché spustenie AI agentov. Jeho cena narástla za posledných 7 dní o približne 14,5 % . Význam integrácie AI a automatizácie obchodovania zaznamenáva tento rok v kryptosfére exponenciálny rast.

2025-07-04T14:45:08,"Total Bitcoin Futures Volume Dropped Nearly 20 Percent in June Compared to the Previous Month! What Does It Mean?","The seasonal effects of the summer months have begun to show themselves in cryptocurrency markets. In June, total Bitcoin futures volume fell by about 20% compared to the previous month, to $1.55 trillion. This figure was well below the monthly average volume of $1.93 trillion in the first five months of 2025. Bitcoin Futures Volume Drops 20% in June: Signal of Summer Recession in Crypto Markets A similar trend was observed last year, when June 2024 futures volume fell 15.7% on a monthly basis, but average volume remained low throughout the summer, although it partially recovered in July. While the monthly average was $1.53 trillion during the June-September 2024 period, this figure remained 10% below the $1.71 trillion average in the first five months of the year. This seasonal downtrend was also seen in 2023. Bitcoin futures volume, which averaged $1.03 trillion per month in the first half of 2023, fell to $717 billion in July 2023, falling by about 30% on a monthly basis. The decline continued in the following two months, with a 2.4% decrease in August and a 21.5% decrease in September. Data for June 2025 indicates that the trend of volume decline in the summer months may be repeated this year. Analysts say that although it is too early to make a definitive judgment, this development strengthens the possibility of a summer recession in crypto markets. Trading volumes in the coming months will clarify the impact of this season on the market. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T14:30:30,"‘I Don’t See How We’ll Do That’: JPMorgan’s Chief Global Strategist Says White House’s 3% US Economic Growth Projection Unsustainable","The chief global strategist of financial services giant JPMorgan says that the White House’s growth projections for the US economy are unfeasible. In a new interview with CNBC Television, JPMorgan executive David Kelly says that the White House’s 3% projected growth for the economy doesn’t make sense as the US doesn’t have the means to boost productivity to match. According to Kelly, baby boomers retiring and shrinking employment numbers will impact the growth of the US economy. However, though he says 3% is untenable, he does envision the economy growing in part. “I don’t see how we’ll do that. In order to do that, you’ve got to boost productivity, because if you look at the US economic growth, in the long run, so far this century, it’s been about 2%. That’s 1.5% from productivity and 0.5% from the growth in labor. The problem is that the baby boomers are retiring, the nation-born working age population is shrinking, so if you end up with zero net immigration, you got no employment growth and that means [you grow] 1.5%, not 3%. Now we might do better than 1.5%, but we’re not close to 3%. There’s nothing in the outlook which tells me that we can sustain 3% growth.” The White House’s projection for the growth of the US economy is related to President Donald Trump’s latest spending bill, which included extensions on tax breaks and is currently being voted on in Congress.

2025-07-04T14:30:24,"Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range","Chainlink (LINK) has been locked in a consolidation phase since early March, following a prolonged period of bearish price action that began to lose momentum. Since then, the token has ranged sideways with notable volatility, reflecting broader uncertainty across the altcoin market. However, as Bitcoin pushes toward its all-time high and market sentiment turns increasingly bullish, analysts believe a decisive move from LINK may be imminent. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance – Bulls Target $97.10 Level Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights pointing to a key support level that could determine Chainlink’s short-term trajectory. According to Martinez, LINK holding above the $12 mark is crucial and could serve as the launchpad for a breakout toward the $18–$20 range. This level has acted as a major pivot in the past, and reclaiming it with strength would likely attract fresh buying pressure. With Bitcoin dominance remaining high and capital rotating selectively into altcoins, Chainlink’s upcoming moves could signal a higher altcoin market direction. Investors and traders are closely watching this consolidation, waiting for a breakout that could kickstart the next leg higher for LINK and potentially confirm the beginning of a stronger altcoin cycle. The coming days could be critical in determining whether Chainlink is ready to rejoin the uptrend. Chainlink Builds Momentum Chainlink has seen a strong resurgence over the past two weeks, gaining more than 22% in value since June 22. After months of consolidation and sideways action, the recent price movement suggests that bullish momentum is returning to the altcoin. The broader market environment is improving, with Bitcoin nearing its all-time high and risk appetite gradually increasing across crypto assets. For Chainlink, this has translated into renewed optimism and a growing expectation of a breakout. Fundamentally, Chainlink remains one of the most important infrastructure projects in the crypto space. Its partnerships with high-profile projects such as Ripple and Ondo Finance highlight its crucial role in powering real-world asset tokenization and secure on-chain data feeds. These integrations support long-term utility and demand, reinforcing investor confidence in the project’s future. Ali Martinez emphasized that holding above the $12 level is key for Chainlink. According to his analysis, sustained price action above this zone could pave the way for a breakout toward the $18–$20 range. Historically, LINK has shown strong impulsive moves after breaking major consolidation zones, and the current structure appears similar. Related Reading: Ethereum Looks Strong Despite Volatility – $10,000 Price Target Gains Momentum LINK Consolidates Below Resistance Chainlink is currently trading at $13.32 after facing a minor rejection from the $14 zone. The chart shows that LINK remains in a consolidation range that began in early March, with price action confined between the $12.20 and $14.50 levels. The token has made multiple attempts to reclaim the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which now sit just above the current price action. These moving averages, along with horizontal resistance around $14, are acting as a strong ceiling for now. Despite the recent pullback, LINK remains structurally bullish on the mid-term as it prints higher lows since the June bottom near $11. Analysts remain optimistic that a decisive close above $14–$14.50 would invalidate this range and pave the way for a push toward the $16–$18 zone. Related Reading: Tron DeFi Activity Expands: SunSwap Hits $3B+ Monthly Swaps In 2025 The 200-day moving average near $16.77 remains a key target in the event of a breakout. However, failure to reclaim $14 could lead to another test of support around $12. Overall, the setup remains constructive but will require renewed bullish momentum—possibly led by Bitcoin strength or positive ecosystem news—for a breakout confirmation. Until then, LINK continues to oscillate in a tight range, with bulls watching closely.

2025-07-04T14:23:08,"Senator Lummis Proposes Crypto Tax Reforms as IRS Faces Watchdog Criticism","Senator Cynthia Lummis has unveiled a new legislative proposal aimed at updating the United States’ tax framework for digital assets, following the exclusion of crypto provisions from the latest federal budget. The move comes as a separate report from the US Treasury Inspector General highlights procedural failures within the IRS Criminal Investigation division regarding the seizure and custody of cryptocurrencies—further underscoring the need for clearer, more consistent federal policies on digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis Introduces Groundbreaking Crypto Tax Reform Bill Amid Frustrations Over Budget Bill Omissions US Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has unveiled a sweeping new draft bill aimed at modernizing the country’s outdated tax framework to accommodate digital assets, after lawmakers once again failed to include crypto-related provisions in the latest federal spending package. The standalone bill proposes a series of reforms long sought by digital asset investors, including a de minimis exemption for small transactions and tax deferrals on mining and staking rewards. The draft legislation, introduced Thursday, seeks to alleviate the mounting tax burden on everyday crypto users and blockchain innovators by carving out specific exemptions for common crypto-related activities. Among the bill’s headline proposals is a de minimis capital gains exemption of $300 per transaction, with a $5,000 annual limit, allowing users to make everyday purchases with crypto without triggering tax reporting obligations. In a statement accompanying the release, Senator Lummis said the bill was “groundbreaking” and designed to bring common sense and clarity to how digital asset activity is taxed in the United States. “This groundbreaking legislation is fully paid for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape, and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world,” said Lummis . “We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation. My legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations.” Beyond the small transaction exemptions, the bill also proposes deferring taxes on mining and staking rewards until the earned digital assets are sold — a move that addresses long-standing complaints that the current tax code unfairly penalizes miners and proof-of-stake validators by treating newly minted tokens as immediate income. Lummis' bill would also exempt crypto lending agreements and digital assets donated to charity from taxation, aligning them more closely with traditional asset treatment. Currently, many crypto users risk facing tax obligations even when using or donating their assets in good faith — a disincentive that critics say hinders broader adoption and philanthropic use of blockchain-based wealth. A Solo Shot After Budget Disappointment The proposal represents Senator Lummis’ latest attempt to deliver on promises made to the cryptocurrency community after crypto-specific tax provisions were left out of the most recent Congressional budget negotiations. Despite bipartisan support for modernizing crypto regulations, the final budget bill moved forward without language addressing the treatment of digital assets. Without a legislative vehicle attached to broader government funding, Lummis’ standalone draft bill now becomes the most realistic path forward for immediate pro-crypto tax reform — but it faces an uphill battle in a deeply divided Senate. Still, industry advocates are applauding the move as a bold step in the right direction. The US crypto community has grown increasingly frustrated over what they describe as “double taxation” and inconsistent treatment of digital assets across jurisdictions and use cases. One of the most contentious issues revolves around decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which operate autonomously and without custodians. Under current interpretations of IRS guidance, users interacting with such protocols could be subject to the same reporting requirements as centralized platforms, despite the lack of a centralized counterparty. This has led to confusion and compliance challenges for retail and institutional users alike. Adding to the complexity, crypto earnings from staking, liquidity provision, or protocol participation can be taxed as income upon receipt, even if the user has not sold or realized any actual profit. In highly volatile markets, this tax timing can result in significant financial losses. DeFi Developers May See Regulatory Relief In a related development, members of the House Financial Services Committee recently proposed an amendment to the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, aiming to exempt developers of decentralized protocols from being classified as money transmitters. This exemption would shield them from burdensome tax reporting rules that currently apply to centralized exchanges. If passed in conjunction with Lummis’ tax bill, the pair of reforms could mark a turning point in how the US treats decentralized platforms, potentially positioning the country as a friendlier jurisdiction for Web3 innovation. Meanwhile, Congressional leaders are scrambling to find a way to incorporate crypto provisions into the final version of the budget bill before it lands on President Donald Trump’s desk. With rising global competition — and more welcoming regulatory frameworks in the EU, UAE, and Hong Kong — pressure is building on US lawmakers to catch up. The crypto industry remains cautiously optimistic. While previous efforts have stalled or been watered down, Senator Lummis’ persistence, combined with growing bipartisan support for digital asset clarity, may finally move the needle. Outlook: A Defining Moment for US Crypto Policy? As the digital asset industry matures, calls for reasonable tax reform and regulatory clarity have grown louder — and more politically urgent. With trillions of dollars in value already flowing through blockchain networks and millions of Americans now holding crypto, the need for a modern tax framework has never been more acute. Senator Lummis’ bill represents a significant step forward, even if it faces procedural hurdles. At a time when innovation is global, many see her proposal as a chance for the US to retain its competitive edge in the digital economy. US Watchdog Criticizes IRS Over Mishandling of Seized Crypto Assets, Calls for Urgent Reforms In related news, a new report from the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has revealed major shortcomings in how the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation division (IRS-CI) manages the seizure and custody of digital assets, adding fuel to growing concerns over the federal government’s ability to securely and transparently handle crypto enforcement cases. The watchdog’s report , published Tuesday, highlights repeated failures by IRS-CI personnel to comply with established protocols for handling confiscated cryptocurrencies between December 2023 and January 2025. The findings raise red flags at a time when the federal government holds one of the largest cryptocurrency stockpiles in the world — estimated at over 200,000 Bitcoin, or more than $21 billion at current market prices. Missing Records and Lax Oversight According to TIGTA’s audit, IRS-CI agents failed to complete or update required seizure memorandums, which are meant to document key details of confiscated digital assets, including wallet addresses, transaction dates, and amounts. The absence of such documentation has left gaps in the official record and raised questions about transparency and accountability. The watchdog emphasized that this failure was not isolated to a single incident but represented a pattern of negligence over a 14-month period. TIGTA's evaluation identified several critical recommendations to fix the deficiencies — all of which were agreed to by IRS-CI leadership. These include: Ensuring IRS-CI personnel understand and adhere to seizure memorandum requirements. Establishing a robust inventory management system to accurately track seized digital assets by quantity, address, and type. Updating internal guidelines to include time frame requirements for preparing seizure memos and for timely updating the inventory system. These reforms, if implemented effectively, could mark a significant shift in how the federal government manages one of the most sensitive and valuable categories of criminally seized assets: cryptocurrency. The report comes at a pivotal moment in US crypto policy. Under President Donald Trump’s renewed term, the administration has revived discussions around establishing a national Bitcoin reserve using digital assets confiscated in criminal cases. While White House officials have floated the idea of converting these holdings into strategic digital reserves, others have proposed alternative acquisition methods, including imposing crypto tariffs or revaluing gold certificates. Regardless of the acquisition method, safe custody of digital assets is a prerequisite for such plans — making the IRS’ missteps particularly alarming. The Scale of Government Crypto Holdings Public interest in the government’s crypto holdings has surged as the value of Bitcoin and other digital assets continues to climb. Based on available data from major criminal seizures, the US government is believed to control approximately 200,000 BTC, although the exact amount may fluctuate with ongoing investigations and asset liquidations. Among the most notable cases: 94,000 BTC from the 2016 Bitfinex hack, seized in 2022. 50,000 BTC tied to the Silk Road darknet marketplace, recovered in separate operations. Other significant seizures from ransomware groups, darknet markets, and fraud schemes. While some of these holdings have been auctioned off in the past, the majority of high-profile Bitcoin seizures in recent years remain under government custody — a responsibility that now appears to be fraught with internal weaknesses.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9807/senator-lummis-proposes-crypto-tax-reforms-as-irs-faces-watchdog-criticism,"REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T14:13:21,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Back In The Red As Rally Stalls At $110,000","Bitcoin (BTC) failed to capitalize on its latest rally as sellers overwhelmed buyers at upper levels. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $110,590 on Thursday, and is down nearly 1%, trading around $108,930. Analysts believe the absence of new buyers and FOMO-driven greed are factors that could keep BTC below $110,000-$112,000 for the time being. Bitcoin Mining Stocks Post Double-Digit Gains Crypto mining stocks registered robust weekly gains despite a brief pullback on Thursday. Stocks rallied thanks to signs of a favorable macroeconomic backdrop that could support the Federal Reserve’s soft landing narrative. Shares of mining firms, including Riot Platforms (RIOT), Hive Digital (HIVE), Hut 8 (HUT8), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Bitfarms (BITF) rallied between 13% and 28% over four trading sessions. US markets closed early on Thursday ahead of the Independence Day weekend. Markets, including public mining companies, responded to a better-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report on Thursday before registering marginal declines. VanEck’s Digital Transformation ETF, which tracks 24 listed digital asset firms, including Coinbase (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR), rose over 3% on Thursday. Bitcoin mining stocks mirrored a broader market rally that saw the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rise to new all-time highs. While the workforce participation has reported a decline, economists have attributed the decline to a crackdown on immigration that may have impacted labor supply. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Cross $600 Million Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported over $600 million in inflows on Thursday, registering their strongest showing in over a month as investors put capital into crypto. The influx helped the ETFs to cross the previous mark of $588 million, reached on June 24. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC recorded for the majority of Thursday’s inflows, registering $224.5 million and $237.1 million. Other ETFs reported smaller inflows, with Ark Invest’s ARKB registering $114,2 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC registered zero net flows. Institutional investors have returned to risk assets like Bitcoin (BTC) due to the anticipation of looser financial conditions under President Trump’s expanded administration policies. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are the primary avenue of exposure to BTC , offering investors regulated assets without the complexities of direct crypto asset ownership. Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Labs, stated, “I think what's driving the ETF flow is the expectation of looser liquidation conditions. It seems risk-on trade is increasingly gaining traction, and for institutions, ETFs are the easiest way to access the Bitcoin exposure.” Can Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Power Bitcoin (BTC) Price Action? Analysts believe Bitcoin (BTC) could gain 40% after President Trump signs the “Big Beautiful Bill” on Independence Day. Crypto investors are eying swift gains as the massive spending bill becomes a reality. The flagship cryptocurrency has historically reacted positively to indications that the US will increase borrowing. The new bill is no exception, with estimates that the US national debt will surge to $40 trillion. The Kobessi Letter, stated in a recent analysis, “To put this into perspective, at the start of 2020, total US debt stood at $23.2 trillion. This would mark a near $17 TRILLION increase in 6 years. Never in history has the US borrowed even remotely near the levels we are borrowing now. This is a crisis.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has retreated during the ongoing session after failing to close above $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp drop at the beginning of the week, falling to a low of $105,328 on Tuesday. However, it recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,845. BTC crossed $109,000 on Thursday, settling at $109,650 after reaching an intraday high of $110,590 before losing momentum during the ongoing session. Crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes believes BTC could move to a new all-time high, but is still likely to test $90,000 this year. Hayes stated in a blog post that the bill, which increases the debt ceiling and cuts taxes, could force the US Treasury to borrow more. President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law on Friday. Hayes argued that the Treasury would refill its General Account, draining liquidity from the markets and impacting the price of assets like BTC . However, he believes BTC will ultimately continue pushing upwards. “Proceed with caution. The bull market might be interrupted for a short period of time.” Hayes previously stated that the central bank’s monetary policy, particularly money printing, could benefit BTC and other cryptocurrencies. BTC’s decline dashes market expectations of a new all-time high, with low spot demand indicating limited upside. BTC’s ability to push to a new all-time high has been limited by a lack of buyers. Market data resource Swissblock Technologies stated in a post on X, “ BTC is breaking out, but where’s the spot demand? Without real demand, breakouts run on fumes. We need buyers to sustain the price breakout.” However, K33 Research highlighted that spot volumes tend to be lower from June to October compared with the rest of the year. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping to a low of $98,385 before reclaiming $100,000 and settling at $100,985. The price recovered on Monday, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settling at $105,443. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC rose 0.66% to $106,137. The price crossed $107,000 on Wednesday, rising 1.19% and settling at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC registered a marginal decline on Thursday, slipping below $107,000 and settling at $106,980. The price recovered over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rose nearly 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. Source: TradingView BTC was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.09% and settling at $107,167. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 and settling at $105,742. Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845.Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose 0.74%, reaching an intraday high of $110,590 before settling at $109,650.
