Source: CoinGeckoThe latest spike in Bitcoin dominance matches historic levels last seen in early 2021, when Bitcoin was trading at around $36,000 and heading toward its previous all-time highs above $60,000.“Bitcoin has been showing strength for weeks now, outstripping other digital tokens, and scarcely flinching against the sort of geo-political events in Asia and the Middle East that may have impacted it in the past,” Mercuryo CEO Petr Kozyakov told Cointelegraph.“With gold also running good all year, there’s now a case for saying that Bitcoin may have proven itself as an economic hedge and a long-term store of value,” he added.Why is the Bitcoin price rising now?Bitcoin’s latest $100,000 breakthrough came amid a combination of political, institutional and macroeconomic factors.Some in the community linked Bitcoin’s latest bullish action to a potential trade deal between the US and the United Kingdom, which Trump hinted at in a Truth Social post on May 7.“Bitcoin is hovering near $100,000, a key psychological level for traders, after Trump hinted at a major trade deal, likely with the UK,” Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu told Cointelegraph.Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF clocks 16 days of inflow as BTC reclaims $97KLiu said the rally is also supported by falling bond yields, a weakening dollar and renewed institutional inflows in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which saw $1.8 billion of inflows in the past trading week.Crypto Fear & Greed Index.

For the rally to sustain, the trade deal narrative will need to evolve into concrete progress.”According to Ben Caselin, chief marketing officer at VALR, there is a “good chance” that Bitcoin will chart new highs, north of $110,000, sooner rather than later, as the asset seeks to consolidate its value above $100,000.“Retail is only set to come in toward what is traditionally the latter part of the Bitcoin four-year cycle, which might see a macro top reached in Q4 of this year,” Caselin told Cointelegraph.At the same time, given continued progress in global crypto regulation and multiple strategic Bitcoin reserve initiatives, Caselin also sees a chance of “prolonged and accelerated growth beyond 2025.”Additional reporting by Amin Haqshanas.Magazine: Bitcoin to $1M ‘by 2029,’ CIA tips its hat to Bitcoin: Hodler’s Digest, April 27 – May 3",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hits-100k-first-time-since-january?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-08T15:00:00.000Z,"User experience could be crypto’s superpower—or its kryptonite","Opinion by Jonathan Farnell, CEO of FreedxIt’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.Take complexity. A 2024 Chainalysis report pointed out that 43% of would-be crypto users shy away from the technical tangle of private keys and gas fees. Have you ever lost a seed phrase? You’re not alone. More than $200 billion in crypto has been lost forever because of it. That’s not just a statistic — it’s a gut punch for someone who thought they’d unlocked the future of finance. Streamlining this chaos could fling open the doors to 5 billion internet users, pushing crypto’s $2.91 trillion market cap, as reported by Cointelegraph, into the stratosphere — potentially reaching $4 trillion in the second quarter of 2025.From headaches to high fivesMany decentralized finance (DeFi) apps currently feel like a hacker’s playground — all data and API integrations, but nothing intuitive that speaks to an ordinary person. Simply swapping cryptic jargon for plain English would be a solid start. Consider swapping “gas fees” to “transaction costs.” Those 12-word seed phrases send users into panic mode, but a familiar gear icon for settings could put users’ minds at ease. Suddenly, managing a wallet isn’t a high-stakes game anymore. It’s just another tool.This isn’t about dazzling users with blockchain’s inner workings. Most people don’t care about the tech under the hood, just like they don’t ask whether their favorite app runs on AWS or Google Cloud. Blockchain isn’t a shiny new internet. It’s infrastructure — powerful, but invisible, when done right. Users want solutions — quick payments, secure savings, and easy access. Streamlined experiences could draw in everyday folks — retirees sending cash to grandkids, small business owners managing cash flow — expanding cryptocurrency’s reach. It’s about turning a daunting process into something approachable, paving the way for broader economic effect. Build confidence through clarityTrust is another sticking point. Transactions can feel uncertain, with phishing scams and tales of lost savings heightening unease. Vague error messages like “transaction failed” frustrate users, but specific feedback — “insufficient funds, please top up your balance” — offers reassurance. Guides on staying secure and pre-set options to avoid errors can make the system feel reliable, not reckless. When technology fades into the background, confidence takes center stage.Design quality shapes perceptions, too. Unpolished interfaces raise doubts about credibility, especially for those accustomed to refined digital tools. Clean, professional layouts signal trustworthiness, while clear benefits — faster payments and control over data — make the case compelling. This shift could reposition cryptocurrency as a practical alternative, not a gamble. It’s not about buzzwords like “trustlessness” or “censorship resistance.” Most users don’t lose sleep over those ideals. They care about quality, ease, and value, not the blockchain badge.Adoption depends on usabilityCryptocurrency could reshape how people trade, save, and connect — growing from 617 million users to billions. Success hinges on accessibility. Platforms that prioritize straightforward design already see more engagement and trust, driving market potential into the trillions, rivaling traditional finance. Poor usability, though, risks leaving this vision unrealized. The promise of self-custody or transparency won’t lure the masses if the experience feels like a chore.Recent: Stop making crypto complexChallenges like regulation and old habits persist, but confusing experiences remain the most significant barrier, keeping everyday users at arm’s length. Blockchain’s promise is real, yet its breakthrough relies on design that feels human and dependable. People don’t adopt tools because they’re built on cutting-edge tech. They adopt tools because they solve real problems — cheaply, simply, and reliably. Cryptocurrency stands ready to expand — it needs to meet people where they are, not where the tech wants them to be.Focus on benefits, not features, and the market could soar. Consider a freelancer who is paid instantly across borders or a parent gifting digital cash without a hitch. That’s what hooks users — not the mechanics of account abstraction or zero-knowledge proofs. Platforms that nail this could turn crypto into a daily staple, boosting adoption and market value. Exchanges leading the charge with intuitive design already prove it: Usability drives growth. Cryptocurrency’s future isn’t about preaching blockchain’s brilliance — it’s about making it so seamless no one even notices it’s there.Opinion by Jonathan Farnell, CEO of Freedx.

The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. “As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.Related: Bitcoin mining — Institutions boost investments amid favorable US climateHut 8 is scaling up operationsGenoot said the financial results follow large-scale investments by Hut 8, including upgrading the firm’s application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) fleet and launching the majority-owned subsidiary of Hut 8, American Bitcoin.American Bitcoin was announced at the end of March, with several members of the US President Donald Trump’s family as partners. According to the announcement, the new venture “aims to become the world’s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve.”Early April reports also revealed that American Bitcoin has plans to raise additional capital, including through an initial public offering. In today’s quarterly earnings announcement, Genoot stated:“The streamlined capital allocation framework made possible by the American Bitcoin launch reinforces our ability to scale lower-cost-of-capital businesses such as high-performance computing.“Related: Browser-based crypto mining in 2025: Still viable or virtually dead?Future expansion plansTalking about future plans, Hut 8’s CEO noted that the company is pushing ahead with its plans for 2025. Those include the energization of the Vega data center, the initial sitework at the River Bend data center and the development of the firm’s utility-scale power portfolio. Genoot added:“We believe these initiatives will further accelerate our ability to generate resilient near-term cash flows while building toward enduring leadership across next-generation digital infrastructure markets.”Hut 8 stock is trading at $12.66 after seeing a 2.2% increase on the trading day on the Nasdaq.

2025-05-08T13:30:00.000Z,"Beyond digital gold, Bitcoin’s next chapter is about to be unlocked — Dan Held","Bitcoin (BTC) has long been branded as “digital gold,” a store of value for believers in scarcity, decentralization and self-sovereignty. As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.Political shiftsWith US President Donald Trump openly backing Bitcoin — and reportedly owning it himself — Held said he sees a regulatory and reputational change. “We have the most open administration toward Bitcoin in the United States,” he said. “It kind of feels weird... Normally in the press, Bitcoin mining is destroying the environment. It’s being used by money launderers… And instead, you've got the president encouraging Bitcoin.”Held traced Bitcoin’s unlikely rise through moments of adversity, from China’s mining crackdowns to the Biden administration’s strict approach to crypto banking. Yet despite those challenges, roughly 25% of Americans now own Bitcoin, he said.DeFi on BitcoinWhat comes next may push the asset into a new phase. Held and Jenkinson are proponents of building decentralized finance (DeFi) tools on top of Bitcoin, functionalities traditionally associated with blockchains like Ethereum or Solana.“If we could bring [DeFi] back to Bitcoin, then Bitcoin could utilize not just spot speculation... but these other speculative games then would allow bitcoin to grow even faster.” That includes borrowing, lending, and staking, all mechanisms that allow users to interact with Bitcoin beyond simple holding or trading.Related: How crypto payments can become the new ‘tap-and-go’ — Pulsar co-founderJenkinson echoed the potential, highlighting a shift in attitude: “If you can use [Bitcoin] and bring DeFi to it, you’re basically allowing people to use digital gold as the underlying asset... It’s a very hard thing to do, because most hardcore Bitcoin maximalists don’t want people to give up their Bitcoin for something else.”That tension between so-called “Bitcoin puritans” and more moderate voices is not new, Held noted. He recounted the 2017 Bitcoin Cash fork, describing it as “a civil war... brother against brother.” But unlike that contentious split, today’s evolution is happening without rewriting Bitcoin’s base rules. “No one’s proposing to change the rules of Bitcoin,” Held said. “This is innovation built on top.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-08T13:15:00.000Z,"Browser-based crypto mining in 2025: Still viable or virtually dead?","Key takeawaysAfter the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy lifting.The idea blew up in the late 2010s with tools like Coinhive, which let website owners mine Monero (XMR) using JavaScript. At first, it seemed like a clever alternative to ads; visitors donated a bit of unused CPU power, and websites earned crypto. But then came cryptojacking. Sites began running these scripts without user permission, draining resources and slowing down devices. In 2019, Coinhive shut down, citing shrinking returns and mounting scrutiny.Now, in 2025, browser crypto mining is making a low-key comeback. New tools, new rules and a fresh generation of crypto users are reviving the concept. But is it worth it or just a relic of crypto’s scrappier past?Let’s break down where things stand today.Did you know? In 2018, Coinhive was responsible for approximately 1.18% of all Monero blocks mined.What’s the status of browser-based crypto mining in 2025?Active platformsThe biggest name in browser crypto mining today is CryptoTab Browser. It’s a Chromium-based browser with a built-in mining feature that lets users passively earn Bitcoin (BTC). It also offers tools like Cloud Boost to multiply earnings and a mining pool for better efficiency.Meanwhile, mobile-first platforms like Pi Network and YouHolder cater to users who want to mine via smartphones — or at least simulate the process while collecting rewards. These platforms blur the line between real mining and gamified engagement, but they’ve drawn millions of users, especially in emerging markets.Supported coinsMonero is still popular for browser mining; its RandomX algorithm is CPU-optimized and ASIC-resistant, which means regular computers can handle it. CryptoTab, meanwhile, focuses on Bitcoin, though it uses a form of pooled hash power to make it viable through a browser interface, though its efficiency and profitability are often debated due to Bitcoin’s high mining difficulty and reliance on specialized hardware.Who is mining crypto via browsers?The browser mining audience today is surprisingly broad:Casual users: People who like the idea of passive income without much commitment.Newcomers to crypto: Those testing the waters without risking capital.Crypto-curious users: Folks who want to earn something on the side while they browse.Browser mining won’t make you rich — let’s be clear. But it does lower the barrier to entry, especially for users in lower-income regions or without access to advanced hardware.Did you know? Some browser-based mining scripts have been designed to continue operating even after a user closes the browser tab by opening hidden windows that persist in the background.Is browser mining profitable in 2025?Short answer: not really. It’s more about novelty or experimentation than making serious money.Mining in a browser might get you a few cents’ worth of crypto per day, but only if you leave your computer running non-stop. And that leads to two problems: electricity costs and hardware stress. Over time, those costs can far outweigh the value of the crypto you earn.For example, in the US, the average residential electricity rate is about $0.15 per kilowatt-hour. Leaving a mid-range laptop mining all day could consume roughly 0.1–0.2 kWh per hour — that’s over $10 per month in electricity for maybe a dollar or two in mined crypto. And you’re putting constant load on your CPU.Compared to other methodsBrowser mining can’t hold a candle to GPU or ASIC setups. A modern ASIC miner like the Antminer S19 Pro churns out up to 110 terahashes per second (TH/s) — that’s several orders of magnitude higher than what a browser script can deliver.Cloud mining, on the other hand, lets users rent mining power from remote farms. It’s more efficient and hands-off but also comes with subscription fees and mixed reputations. At least with browser mining, you’re only risking your own device and electricity bill.Did you know? In 2025, some cloud mining platforms have integrated artificial intelligence to optimize mining operations, enhancing efficiency and profitability for users without requiring direct hardware management.Environmental footprintWhile it consumes less power than an ASIC farm, browser mining still adds up. Thousands of users mining inefficiently on personal devices generate a surprisingly high cumulative power draw.That’s why most efforts to make crypto mining greener — like using renewable energy or optimizing ASIC efficiency — haven’t trickled down to the browser level. If you’re eco-conscious, browser mining isn’t the cleanest option out there.What’s next for browser crypto mining?Tech upgradesWebAssembly (Wasm) has boosted what browsers can do, including mining. It allows faster, more efficient script execution, meaning browsers can now run lightweight mining scripts without wrecking user experience.Platforms like CryptoTab have also improved their UX, integrating features like built-in VPNs and ad blockers. This is an effort to make mining feel more like a bonus and less like a burden.Some decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, such as Ore, are even experimenting with combining browser mining and decentralized finance. It’s the early days, but the potential is there to let users contribute computing power and earn rewards while interacting with decentralized applicatioins (DApps) — all within a browser tab.Market and regulationIn 2025, global crypto adoption has been growing, but so is regulatory scrutiny. In the US, the SEC is pushing for clearer guidance, which may eventually affect how browser-based mining tools are classified or taxed.Elsewhere, countries like Kuwait have cracked down on mining altogether, citing energy shortages. Local regulations will play a huge role in determining where and how browser crypto mining can survive.Alternative use casesMining isn’t the only game in town. Brave browser, for example, lets users earn Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) just by viewing ads, which can be used within the Brave ecosystem or exchanged. It’s not mining, technically, but it’s another way to earn crypto passively through browsing.In the DeFi world, there’s potential to connect browser mining with yield farming or liquidity mining. Imagine earning a trickle of tokens just by keeping your browser open and interacting with onchain applications. It’s early, but real experiments are underway.Here’s an example of how you can use BAT earned from viewing ads and channel them into DeFi for additional returns:You transfer your earned BAT to a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap, a leading DeFi platform for liquidity mining.On Uniswap, you pair your BAT with another token — e.g., Ether (ETH) or a stablecoin like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — to provide liquidity to a BAT/ETH or BAT/USDT pool. This involves depositing equal values of both tokens into the pool, receiving LP (liquidity provider) tokens in return.You stake these LP tokens in Uniswap’s liquidity mining program (or a similar protocol like SushiSwap) to earn rewards, which may include a share of trading fees (typically 0.3% per trade) and potentially additional UNI (UNI) or other governance tokens as incentives.To maximize returns, you could take your LP tokens and stake them on another DeFi platform, like Yearn.finance, which algorithmically seeks the highest yield opportunities across protocols. For example, Yearn.finance might stake your Uniswap LP tokens in a pool offering 10%-20% APY, compounding your returns.Alternatively, you could use a yield aggregator like Yield Yak on Solana, which auto-compounds rewards to boost earnings.However, be aware that in liquidity mining, price fluctuations between paired tokens (e.g., BAT/ETH) can lead to losses compared to holding the tokens outright. Also, the value of earned tokens (BAT, UNI, etc.) and DeFi rewards can fluctuate (market volatility), impacting overall returns.Is browser-based crypto mining worth it?So, is browser mining dead in 2025? Not quite, but it’s no gold rush either.It’s a fringe activity, appealing to newcomers, tinkerers and anyone curious about crypto’s more obscure corners. With better tech and clearer ethics than in the Coinhive days, it’s no longer a threat — just a slow, modest way to dip your toes in.If your goal is to understand crypto without buying in, browser mining still has a role to play.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-browser-based-cryptocurrency-mining-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-08T13:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin DeFi sees surge in mining participation despite drop in TVL","Smart contract platform Rootstock, the home of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin, saw a sharp increase in network security and mining engagement in the first quarter of 2025, even as activity cooled.Merged mining participation surged to an all-time high of 81%, up from 56.4% in Q4 2024, driven by the integration of major mining pools Foundry and SpiderPool, according to Messari’s first “State of Rootstock” report for 2025, shared with Cointelegraph.The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.The increased security coincided with a 60% reduction in transaction fees, improving user experience and positioning Rootstock more competitively within the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem.“As BTCFi continues to grow, Rootstock is well-positioned for broader adoption through core upgrades like a 60% reduction in transaction fees, alongside sustained investment in builder education and incentive programs,” Messari analyst Andrew Yang said.Rootstock overview for Q1 2025.

USDt (USDT) remained the leading stablecoin by value, holding $3.8 million and a 27.5% market share. However, its dominance fell significantly from 41.3% in Q4 2024.By the end of Q1, no single stablecoin commanded over 30% of Rootstock’s stablecoin market.Active addresses dropped by 26.5%, and new addresses plunged by 54.7%, although daily transactions rose slightly by 4.3%, reaching an average of 11,524 per day.Active addresses drop on Rootstock.

The update is designed to improve user onboarding by offering interactive guidance and simplifying asset management across blockchains.The AI agent, named Mia (short for Movement in Action), is powered by Near.AI — an open-source AI model platform with crosschain capabilities. Integrated into the Sweat wallet, Mia helps users to bridge, swap and manage their crypto rewards without needing deep crypto knowledge..Sweat is rolling out support for Base, Ethereum, Arbitrum and BNB Chain. Within the app, users can now bridge assets and swap native tokens across networks, with the option to pay gas fees in Sweat (SWEAT) tokens.Sweat co-founder Oleg Fomenko told Cointelegraph: “We’ve shifted to championing the Movement Economy — an expansive, multichain ecosystem where movement is not only rewarded but also unlocks access to financial tools, health experiences and self-sovereign identity.”Mia in Sweat wallet Source: swe.atRelated: Near’s crosschain AI Assistant will soon book flights and order takeout for youPersonalized AI agents aim for a simpler interfaceMove-to-Earn is an emerging model that rewards users for physical activity by combining movement with technology. Apps like StepN, Plena and Sweat are now exploring ways to integrate AI to enhance their platforms. StepN, for example, employs AI to improve anti-cheating mechanisms, while Sweat focuses on using AI to streamline the user experience and enable multichain decentralized finance (DeFi) functionality.Sweat uses the move-to-earn model, rewarding users for every 1,000 steps taken. Users can exchange their token rewards for products, donate them, or convert them into a currency of their choice.Fomenko told Cointelegraph that Mia is more like “a helpful friend” than a technical dashboard. It focuses on “guiding users through tracking how steps convert into Sweat tokens, earning staking rewards, or performing onchain actions like swapping or bridging tokens.”According to Sweat, the wallet currently has 20 million users and over 19 million tokenholders. Mia will also personalize in-app recommendations based on each user’s behavior and preferences, including surfacing relevant offers, setting reminders, or explaining new wallet features.Privacy and security remain prioritiesAs AI-driven tools become more integrated with crypto wallets, concerns around data privacy and misuse have grown. Fomenko told Cointelegraph that the risks are addressed through “a combination of GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation]-compliant data handling practices, secure anonymization protocols and frequent external audits”.“By aligning with the highest privacy standards and prioritizing user sovereignty, Sweat ensures that AI serves as a helpful, secure, and trustworthy assistant in the Web3 journey,” Fomenko added.However, as AI agents scale, the risk of AI-driven phishing attacks increases, with bots sending personalized messages that closely mimic legitimate communications. To address these concerns, Fomenko said, “Mia operates transparently, providing clear, explainable prompts where users remain in control — they can accept, reject, or override suggestions at any time.”Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sweat-wallet-launches-ai-agent-mia-crosschain-defi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-08T12:00:00.000Z,"What is VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE) and how does it work?","What is ​VanEck's Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE)              VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE) exposes investors to companies driving blockchain adoption across multiple industries. The fund is scheduled to begin trading on May 14, 2025, following its inception on May 13, 2025.As the global economy shifts to a digital core, NODE offers active equity investment in real-world companies shaping that future. This ETF is actively managed, meaning a portfolio manager and not just an algorithm, selects the included stocks.The ETF may allocate up to 25% of its assets to crypto-linked exchange-traded products (ETPs) via a Cayman Islands subsidiary, providing indirect exposure to digital assets while adhering to US tax regulations. With a management fee of 0.69%, $NODE offers a diversified approach to participating in the evolving digital asset economy without direct cryptocurrency investments.                  How VanEck’s $NODE ETF builds its portfolio              VanEck’s $NODE ETF is designed to expose investors to companies at the forefront of blockchain and digital asset innovation. The ETF plans to hold between 30 and 60 stocks selected from over 130 publicly traded enterprises integral to the digital asset ecosystem.These stocks may span across the following sectors:Data centers: Infrastructure hubs that deliver the computational power necessary for blockchain networks. Cryptocurrency exchanges: These platforms, like Coinbase, facilitate the trading and exchange of digital assets.Miners: Organizations that verify Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. Crypto-holding companies: Publicly listed businesses that include Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury.Traditional financial institutions: Established banks and financial service providers incorporating blockchain solutions into their offerings.Consumer and gaming enterprises: Enterprises adopting blockchain technology in consumer applications and gaming platforms.Asset managers: Professionals and firms developing and overseeing investment vehicles tied to digital asset markets.Energy infrastructure providers: Businesses offering energy solutions tailored to support blockchain and crypto mining operations.Semiconductor and hardware firms: Companies such as Nvidia that design and manufacture chips and specialized mining equipment.To further diversify its portfolio, $NODE may allocate up to 25% of its assets to cryptocurrency ETPs, providing indirect exposure to digital assets. This allocation is managed through a Cayman Islands subsidiary, allowing the ETF to navigate US tax regulations effectively. VanEck employs a rigorous selection process for its holdings, combining fundamental analysis, market trend assessment, strategic positioning and valuation metrics to identify companies leading the digital transformation. According to a Jan. 15 filing with US regulators regarding the proposed ETF, at least 80% of its investments could be allocated to \""digital transformation companies\"" and digital asset instruments.Did you know? Crypto ETFs let you invest in digital assets like Bitcoin or blockchain stocks without setting up a crypto wallet. They are traded on traditional exchanges and offer regulated exposure to crypto markets, making them accessible to mainstream investors and institutions.                  How VanEck’s $NODE ETF uses blockchain and Bitcoin cycle metrics to optimize investment              VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE) offers a unique approach to blockchain investment. It focuses on companies leveraging blockchain for real-world applications, rather than tracking the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH). Each company in the $NODE portfolio has either blockchain central to its business model or future strategy. VanEck evaluates firms based on their tangible progress and innovation. Companies in the ETF’s portfolio may include sectors like fintech, supply chain, gaming and digital identity.To manage market volatility, VanEck utilizes Bitcoin cycle indicators — metrics based on historical BTC price patterns — to adjust the ETF’s risk exposure dynamically. This approach helps optimize performance by aligning the portfolio with broader market sentiment and crypto-economic cycles.By investing in $NODE, investors gain exposure to the expanding influence of blockchain beyond speculative assets. This helps investors capture the long-term growth potential of real-world blockchain integration across industries. The ETF reflects a forward-looking strategy reflecting how blockchain transforms the global economy.Did you know? Canada launched the world’s first spot Bitcoin ETF – Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC) – in February 2021. It beat the US to market and sparked a wave of regulated crypto investment products globally.                  Difference between $NODE and general equity ETFs              VanEck’s $NODE ETF stands apart from general equity ETFs in strategy and focus. Unlike broad-market funds that track indexes like the S&P 500 or FTSE 100, $NODE invests exclusively in companies adopting and building blockchain technology.While general equity ETFs typically use passive strategies, $NODE is actively managed. VanEck’s fund managers handpick portfolio companies based on their real-world contributions to the blockchain economy. A management fee supports this hands-on approach, allowing the ETF to stay aligned with the fast-changing blockchain landscape.$NODE does not hold Bitcoin or Ether. Instead, it uses Bitcoin cycle signals — like regular “halving” events that cut new supply and long-term price trends — to decide when to take more or less risk in its investments. This helps VanEck adjust the fund as the crypto market changes, which can affect how much money flows into blockchain projects, how many people start using them and overall market sentiment.By focusing on blockchain’s real-world business use rather than cryptocurrency speculation, $NODE offers investors a way to participate in the digital transformation of industries worldwide. It’s a future-facing alternative to general equity ETF models.The following table illustrates the difference between $NODE and general equity ETFs:                  How to buy $NODE              To buy VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE), investors need a brokerage account that provides them access to the Cboe BZX Exchange, where the ETF is listed. Once you have set up and funded the account, search for the ticker symbol “NODE.” Review the ETF’s details, including its management fee and investment strategy, before placing a buy order. $NODE trades during regular market hours like any standard stock or ETF. As with any investment, you should understand the fund’s objectives, holdings and risks beforehand to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.Did you know? In January 2024, the US SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity. This marked a significant regulatory milestone and fueled billions in inflows within weeks.                  $NODE: Institutional interest and key risks amid regulatory shifts              VanEck’s launch of the $NODE ETF comes amid rising institutional interest in crypto-linked investments and a more supportive regulatory backdrop. Still, the fund carries unique risks tied to the volatile crypto ecosystem.The launch aligns with positive regulatory developments, such as the proposed US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and potential stablecoin legislation, signaling stronger institutional engagement. $NODE aims to capture surging demand for crypto-equity exposure. A March 2025 survey showed that 68% of financial advisers now seek such options for their clients.Macro trends are also favorable: Bitcoin’s market dominance rose to 62.2% in Q1 2025, driven by institutional preference for regulated vehicles. Public companies collectively added 100,000 BTC to their treasuries, underscoring corporate confidence in Bitcoin. VanEck’s bullish outlook targets – $180,000 BTC and $520 Solana (SOL) by year-end — further reflect sector momentum.However, $NODE is not immune to crypto-sector risks. While it doesn’t hold cryptocurrencies directly, its portfolio is still exposed to market volatility, Bitcoin price swings and potential tech stock corrections. Regulatory setbacks may also affect the broader blockchain industry. Additionally, its derivatives strategy, managed through a Cayman subsidiary, introduces counterparty and liquidity risks.Investors should weigh these factors carefully, balancing the fund’s compliance-driven structure and VanEck’s asset management reputation against these sector-specific vulnerabilities.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-vanecks-onchain-economy-etf-node-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

This results in the advantages of account abstraction being accessible without creating new dedicated onchain addresses, rendering the transition of existing addresses possible.Another wallet that launched new features was Trust Wallet, allowing users to pay gas (transaction fees) in tokens such as stablecoins instead of Ether (ETH). The new wallets are also programmable and still ensure self-custody.Source: Trust WalletRelated: AI and account abstraction keys to mass Web3 adoption: X Spaces recap with Plena FinanceAmbire’s take on the updateAccording to an Ambire announcement shared with Cointelegraph, key features users can now enjoy without switching accounts include a crosschain by default architecture, with one dashboard showing balances on all chains. One wallet can be used across all blockchains, gas fees are abstracted and the system uses a decentralized finance (DeFi) aggregator Li.Fi for its swap and bridging needs.The company also promises transaction simulation across all supported chains, scam application detection and minimal token approvals. This statement follows some developers raising concerns that EIP-7702 provided a new avenue for phishing campaigns to empty entire wallets at once.Ambire also claimed that it does not rely on third-party services, allowing for better privacy features and higher reliability (no third party whose outage will result in a wallet outage). The firm also said that the new accounts are more accessible to AI agents:“Account programmability enables AI agents to act upon your account in the future to enhance your portfolio yield, save your DeFi positions, claim airdrops automatically and more.”Georgiev claimed that Ambire’s offering is the first on the market since Trust Wallet announced that it will be “live soon.” Ambire’s updated system was deployed minutes after the update during a live X conference.Related: How smart accounts and account abstraction can unlock Ethereum’s full utilityTrust Wallet’s new systemsTrust Wallet’s announcement describes the upgrade as the biggest since Ethereum’s full transition to proof-of-stake in the “merge” event.

The new wallet will also support sponsored transactions where third parties can cover gas fees to onboard new users and automated actions such as subscriptions, dollar-cost averaging and more.All those features will become available to existing users without re-creating new accounts with new seed phrases.

2025-05-08T08:01:00.000Z,"Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC? Here’s what you need to know","Is your gaming PC capable of mining crypto?              As of May 2025, Bitcoin mining is looking attractive again. With Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $95,000 and transaction fees hitting new highs after the 2024 halving, mining rewards — though smaller — are worth chasing. From home setups to industrial-scale farms, the question of whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is back in the spotlight.And if you’re a gamer, chances are you’ve looked at your rig and wondered: Can a gaming PC mine crypto? After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily. It’s a fair question: Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC?The short answer: Yes, but it won’t be worth it. The long answer: Understanding Bitcoin miningMining is the process that adds new BTC to circulation. More importantly, it’s how the Bitcoin network stays secure and functions without a central authority. Every time someone sends or receives Bitcoin, miners verify and record that transaction.This is all powered by proof-of-work (PoW), a consensus mechanism where miners race to encode transactions in a format that is acceptable to the network. It’s essentially just a massive guessing game, where miners try different inputs until one generates a hash with enough leading zeroes to meet the network’s current difficulty target.For example, a valid Bitcoin block might start with something like 00000000000000000000956e9ff76455.... The first miner to hit that valid hash wins the reward: currently 3.125 BTC, plus transaction fees.The issue is, to generate that many leading zeroes in 2025, you’re looking at around 10³¹ hash attempts on average to produce a valid hash.As you can imagine, that takes a lot of power.Did you know? The energy used to mine a single Bitcoin block today could power an average US household for over 10 years. That’s the cost of making sure the network stays decentralized and tamper-proof.                  From CPUs to ASICs: How mining hardware evolved              It didn’t use to be this hard to mine Bitcoin. As more miners joined the network and the total computing power surged, the protocol automatically ramped up the difficulty. That’s by design. Bitcoin adjusts to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, no matter how much horsepower is thrown at it.Back in 2009, Bitcoin mining for beginners meant using a regular laptop CPU. Then came the rise of GPUs — graphics cards originally built for gaming — which dramatically improved mining performance.But then came ASICs, application-specific integrated circuits, designed solely to mine Bitcoin. These machines are vastly more powerful and energy-efficient than any GPU. By 2015, they had effectively taken over the mining scene.Fast forward to 2025: ASICs still reign supreme. If you’re wondering about the best setup for mining Bitcoin on PC, know that ASIC vs. GPU mining isn’t a fair fight anymore. That doesn’t mean your gaming rig is useless, but it does mean you’ll want to consider alternative strategies.Did you know? After Sept. 30, 2025, 4GB GPUs will no longer work due to DAG size limits.                   Gaming PCs vs. ASIC miners              Bitcoin mining with a gaming PC, even with a high-end GPU like the RTX 4090, is inefficient and unlikely to be profitable due to low performance, high energy costs and hardware wear-and-tear compared to ASIC miners.Performance: Can your GPU keep up?Let’s say you’re using an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 — top of the line. Sounds heavy-duty, right?Not for Bitcoin GPU mining.That card might do well on other algorithms like Ethash (used in Ethereum Classic), but when it comes to Bitcoin’s SHA-256, it barely scratches the surface. Even the mighty RTX 4090 gets crushed by ASICs. A high-end ASIC like the Antminer S21 Pro pumps out 200 terahashes per second (TH/s) — that’s trillions of hashes per second, compared to maybe a few hundred megahashes per second from a GPU. That’s a millionfold difference.Efficiency: The electricity bill tells the real storyLet’s talk about power. A GPU like the 4090 pulls around 450 watts. But the hashing performance it delivers is minuscule compared to the watts consumed. ASICs, by contrast, draw more power (e.g., 3,500 watts) but deliver far better output — roughly 17.5 joules per terahash.In short, even if you’re mining Bitcoin on a gaming PC 24/7, the energy cost per dollar earned is painful. Is Bitcoin mining profitable with a gaming PC? Not really. Especially when you factor in cooling, hardware strain and your local energy prices.Economics: Does it make any sense?Even with low electricity rates, the ROI on mining Bitcoin from home with a gaming computer is near zero — if not outright negative. Solo mining? Forget it. The chances of hitting a block are microscopic. Pool mining? Your contribution is so small compared to ASIC farms that the payouts will be negligible.And then there’s the wear and tear. GPUs weren’t designed to run at full capacity around the clock. Long-term mining can shorten their lifespan and may void warranties.Did you know? WhatToMine is a useful site that shows what coins are most profitable to mine with your exact setup. Just plug in your GPU, and it does the rest.                  Alternative cryptocurrencies for gaming PCs              If Bitcoin mining on PC feels like bringing a Nerf gun to a tank fight, don’t lose hope. There are still coins designed to be mined with GPUs in 2025 — and some even reward users fairly for it.Let’s take a look at such cryptocurrencies:Ethereum Classic (ETC): GPU-friendly legacy chainStill using the Ethash algorithm, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a solid option for GPU miners. Blocks are mined every 13 seconds with a 3.2 ETC reward. Ravencoin (RVN): Built for the peopleRavencoin uses KAWPOW, an algorithm specifically designed to resist ASIC domination. It’s friendly to GPU miners and offers quick one-minute blocks with 2,500 Ravencoin (RVN) rewards. Mining altcoins with GPU setups is still very viable here.Monero (XMR): Privacy-first and CPU/GPU accessibleMonero relies on the RandomX algorithm, making it accessible to both CPU and GPU miners. You won’t get rich, but it’s a way to earn passively, especially if you’ve got cheap electricity and want passive income from mining.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/can-you-mine-bitcoin-with-a-gaming-pc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

It contained crypto-related information that could help blockchain analysts trace the group’s illicit financial flows.  Ransomware is a type of malware used by malicious actors. It locks its target’s files or computer systems, making them inaccessible. The attackers typically demand a ransom payment, often in digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), in exchange for a decryption key to unlock the files.LockBit is one of the most notorious crypto ransomware groups. In February 2024, 10 countries launched a joint operation to disrupt the group, saying that the organization had caused billions in damages to key infrastructure. Source: ReyXBFNo Bitcoin private keys leakedWhile almost 60,000 Bitcoin wallets were leaked, no private keys were included. One X user shared a conversation with a LockBit operator, confirming the breach. However, the LockBit person said no private keys or data were lost. Despite this, analysts at Bleeping Computer said the database contained 20 tables, including a “builds” table. This included individual ransomware builds created by the organization’s affiliates. The data also identified some of the target companies for the builds. In addition, the leaked database also included a “chats” table. This table contained over 4,400 negotiation messages between victims and the ransomware organization. Related: Crypto crime in 2024 likely exceeded $51B, far higher than reported: ChainalysisLockBit hack tied to Everest ransomware breachIt’s unclear who was behind the breach and how they got into LockBit’s operations, but Bleeping Computer analysts said the message used in the Everest ransomware site breach matched the one used in LockBit. The analysts suggested that there may be a link between the two incidents. The breach highlighted the role that crypto plays in the ransomware economy. Each victim is usually assigned an address to pay their ransom, allowing the affiliates to monitor payments while attempting to obscure ties to their main wallets. The exposure of the addresses allows law enforcement and blockchain investigators to track patterns and potentially link past ransom payments to known wallets. Magazine: Adam Back says Bitcoin price cycle ’10x bigger’ but will still decisively break above $100K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/lockbit-ransomware-breach-bitcoin-addresses-leaked?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-07T21:30:00.000Z,"Falling DXY part of US financial system’s ‘long-term transition’ — Will Bitcoin continue to shine?","What to know:Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?The trouble is, this might not be a temporary dip. The dollar’s slide could reflect a deeper, long-term reconfiguration of both the US economy and the global monetary order. In a May 4 newsletter, independent market analyst Lyn Alden made a compelling case: not only is a weaker dollar likely, but it may be necessary. According to Alden, a controlled retreat from dollar hegemony might be one of the few paths left to stabilize an increasingly fragile system. And if the US relinquishes its role at the center of the monetary universe, the world will need alternatives. Neutral assets like gold and Bitcoin could be well-positioned to take on a more central role.The US and the dollar are in a “long-term transition”Fractional reserve banking, the system that fiat money relies on, creates money through lending. Each time a bank issues a loan, it expands the supply of broad money, without necessarily creating enough base money to cover the loan principal and its interest. This means that the current financial system relies on continual credit expansion and refinancing to remain solvent.Today, the US economy holds around $102 trillion in public and private dollar-denominated debt, with another $18 trillion owed by borrowers outside the US And that’s not even counting derivatives, which would push the total much higher. Yet only $5.8 trillion in base money actually exists.“It’s like a game of musical chairs with more than 20 kids for every chair,” Alden writes. “And the music can’t stop for long.”The US plays a special role in this system. It imports more than it exports, while surplus countries funnel their dollar earnings back into American stocks, bonds, real estate, and private equity. For the $18 trillion in dollar liabilities held abroad, non-US entities hold roughly $61 trillion in US dollar assets. But when dollar liquidity tightens — when the music stops — foreign holders often have to sell those assets to service their debts, which, in turn, threatens US financial stability.This happened in March 2020, when parts of the Treasury market froze during the peak panic stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Fed stepped in, quickly opening emergency swap lines with foreign central banks and printing trillions in base money to re-float the system. That solved the liquidity issue but unleashed inflation, hitting lower-income Americans the hardest.Combined with decades of industrial decline and widening social gaps, this situation eventually created the political mandate for Donald Trump and his protectionist agenda. However, the tariff shock is unlikely to be successful, Alden argues. The current system implies that the US must run structural trade deficits to provide the global economy with enough dollars to keep the greenback’s dominance. The only way of rebalancing trade flows is through a weak dollar and a step back from monetary hegemony.As Alden puts it,“I view the United States and indeed the global financial system as likely beginning a very long-term transition.”The Bitcoin to DXY relationshipBitcoin (BTC) and DXY are inversely correlated. When the dollar strengthens, risk-on assets like BTC lose some of their appeal to investors. When the dollar weakens, BTC becomes more attractive not just as a speculative play, but as an alternative currency. In a system where fiat must effectively lose value over time to function, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and monetary neutrality offer a compelling hedge.Overlaying BTC and DXY charts reveals that major divergences between the two often align with Bitcoin trend reversals. In April 2018 and March 2022, such divergences signaled bear markets, while November 2020 marked the start of a bullish rally. In the 2023-2026 cycle, BTC caught up with the DXY in early 2024, and the two moved largely in sync until recently. A clear divergence began at the beginning of April 2025, with the DXY dropping below 100 for the first time in two years. If past patterns are any guide, this could signal the start of a new BTC rally. And if the US moves to strategically weaken the dollar in the long term, the impact could extend well beyond Bitcoin’s usual cyclical price action.DXY vs BTC/USD 1-day. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewRelated: How much Bitcoin can Berkshire Hathaway buy?Where to invest in a post-dollar era?Periods of monetary upheaval are notoriously difficult to navigate. While short-term tactics may differ, longer-term strategies point to neutral, high-quality reserve assets — especially those that stand to benefit structurally from de-dollarization.Gold fits this bill. So does Bitcoin.Several sovereign entities are already stockpiling Bitcoin. El Salvador and Bhutan are directly buying and mining BTC. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. and the US state of Wisconsin’s pension fund have exposure via spot BTC ETFs. A dozen US states hold equity in Michael Saylor’s Strategy, as well as over 13,000 companies and institutions. Even Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, has Bitcoin exposure through its holdings of Strategy, Mara Holdings, Coinbase, and Riot.With the dollar retreating from the global financial arena, space will open for other currencies. There are more and more examples of international trade deals settled in yuan, dirham, or other national currencies. Reuters reports that cross-border yuan payments surged to a record in March. The euro is also on the rise, gaining 10% against the dollar since February. This is all the more impressive taking into account that the European Central Bank has been continuously cutting interest rates, which now stand at just 2.5%, far below the Fed’s 4.5%.The much-debated \""de-dollarization\"" is no longer hypothetical. It’s unfolding in real time. As nations and companies search for stable, neutral alternatives to settle trade and store value, Bitcoin’s borderless and politically neutral nature positions it as a serious contender. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The former CEO, as well as SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and former chief technology officer Thomas Smith, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of the platform’s SFM token.According to reporting from the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) on May 6, Karony implied that Nagy, who reportedly fled to Russia after authorities filed charges, was responsible for some of the alleged fraud at SafeMoon. On the first day of the trial, after jury selection, Smith reportedly appeared as a witness for the prosecution with a SafeMoon victim.The trial, expected to run until May 26, has arguably received less media attention and scrutiny than other crypto cases, such as the 2023 trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and the sentencing of former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Karony pleaded not guilty to charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, and has been free on a $3 million bond since February 2024.Related: What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?Many high-profile individuals from the crypto industry who faced criminal charges did not publicly comment on social media until the conclusion of their cases, likely on the advice of counsel.

It has a market capitalization of nearly $85 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.Meanwhile, asset manager VanEck proposed on May 5 the first BNB ETF in the United States.

As of May 7, BNB Chain ranks fourth among layer-1 blockchain networks by TVL, the data shows. According to Standard Chartered, BNB Chain’s “use cases remain almost entirely on decentralised exchanges [DEXs], lending protocols, and liquid staking. This makes it a much more concentrated and ‘old-fashioned’ smart contract platform than rivals,” it said in a May research note reviewed by Cointelegraph.“While this caps upside potential, it also provides a degree of stability,” according to the asset manager. PancakeSwap is among BNB Chain’s largest DEXs, with roughly $1.5 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.USD1 on BNB Chain vs. Ethereum.

The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.Ether 30-day futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe ETH futures premium has remained below the 5% neutral threshold, indicating a lack of appetite from leveraged bulls. More significantly, this indicator was unchanged at 3% after the Pectra upgrade, suggesting traders did not adjust their positions despite the upgrade’s successful deployment. The subdued response can be partly explained by investors’ focus on macroeconomic issues, as recession risks arise amid uncertainty in global trade disputes. But traders’ lack of interest in Ether predates the recent worsening of risk aversion conditions. In fact, ETH underperformed the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization by 28% in the first three months of 2025. The lackluster price impact following the Pectra upgrade reflects broader dissatisfaction, as competing blockchains have gained traction.Solana monthly active addresses vs. layer-1 competitors. Source: Token TerminalHistorically, high Ethereum base layer fees may have limited network activity, but these costs have dropped below $1 since mid-February. Additionally, Ethereum’s leading layer-2 solution, Base, currently boasts 10.3 million monthly active users-far fewer than Solana’s 82.2 million and BNB Chain’s 25.9 million, according to Token Terminal data.Ethereum lags in DApp interoperability — Will it hurt ETH price? Solana has dominated the decentralized exchange sector, particularly in token launches, by offering an integrated user experience. Similarly, Hyperliquid has exceeded expectations in perpetual futures trading, demonstrating that traders’ primary focus is not necessarily on Ethereum’s decentralization and security. Meanwhile, Tron has made significant inroads in the stablecoin market.Blockchains and DApps 30-day fees, USD. Source: DefiLlamaEthereum’s leadership in total value locked (TVL) remains undisputed at $53.7 billion. However, this has provided little benefit to ETH holders, as network fees have been relatively low at $19 million over the past 30 days, according to DefiLlama. For comparison, Tron has amassed $51.8 million in fees in the same period, while Solana has accrued $39.4 million.Source: X/ProbablyNoamNoam Hurwitz, head of engineering at Alchemy, noted that Ethereum blob fees have dropped to their lowest possible level since the Pectra upgrade. For Hurwitz, Ether’s success depends on base layer scalability, including further improvements in the rollup mechanism, and ultimately, a more seamless user experience.Related: Standard Chartered predicts BNB will more than double in 2025Bridging assets and data across Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem has long been a challenge, while users on Solana and BNB Chain can easily switch between multiple decentralized applications (DApps). The Pectra upgrade, while a step in the right direction, does not resolve this issue, which explains why ETH has been unable to reclaim the $2,200 level seen in early March.For Ether’s price to climb 22% from its current $1,810 level, investors likely need reassurance that the network’s progress, whether through deposits or layer-2 growth, translates into clear benefits. Ultimately, improved staking yields or stronger incentives are needed to drive broader adoption of DApps, which in turn would generate increased demand for ETH within the ecosystem.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He suggested during a confirmation hearing that he would oppose the creation of any US-issued central bank digital currency while in office.Related: Bitcoin ‘Realized Cap’ hits $890B as BTC traders focus on recapturing $100KDemocrats push back on crypto bills amid memecoin dinner controversyEven before announcing that he intended to hold an exclusive dinner and VIP tour for some of his top memecoin holders, Trump faced scrutiny from many lawmakers over allegations of conflicts of interest surrounding his crypto ventures. However, the dinner announcement seemed to galvanize some Democrats against any crypto-related legislation.Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, led a walkout of a hearing addressing the Republican-drafted crypto market structure bill on May 6, citing the need to explore “Trump’s crypto corruption.” A group of nine Democrats in the Senate likewise said they will not support the GENIUS stablecoin bill in its current form, suggesting stronger Anti-Money Laundering, foreign issuer, and national security safeguards. It’s unclear at the time of publication whether Republicans, who control both chambers, will still have the votes to pass either bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-treasury-secretary-crypto-bills-during-hearing?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend. Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.Bitcoin realized cap. Source: CryptoQuantThe realized cap’s rise highlights the total investment held by Bitcoin owners, with long-term holders (LTHs) and short-term holders (STHs) increasing their positions. It reflects investors’ conviction, signaling a potential anticipation for a price breakout. Recent market trends have supported this optimism. Cointelegraph reported that large Bitcoin holders have been actively accumulating Bitcoin since late March 2025. Data indicates that wallets between 10 and 10,000 BTC added 81,338 BTC over six weeks. This accumulation signals confidence in the current price uptrend and the possibility of BTC returning to $100,000.Glassnode data revealed a notable rise in Bitcoin whale addresses holding over 1,000 BTC, climbing from 1,945 on March 1 to 2,006 on May 7. This marks the most significant 30-day increase for this cohort in 2025 and the highest surge since Q1 2024, when a similar accumulation trend preceded Bitcoin's all-time high in March 2024.Bitcoin whale count balance >1K BTC.

However, if BTC breaks above the resistance zone of $97,000 to $99,000, the higher time frame (HTF) outlook could tilt toward bulls.Bitcoin 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThis resistance area carries weight due to a price cluster formed in Q1, which previously led to a downward move. If BTC price clears $99,000, it might shift market dynamics, potentially pressuring short positions and adding to bullish liquidity.The $100,000 level appears to be more of a psychological marker than a significant resistance level. If BTC surpasses the $97,000-$99,000 resistance and establishes it as support, it could pave the way for a move toward $110,000, although this would depend on market conditions and momentum.Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, suggested that the dip below $94,000 and subsequent recovery may indicate a market bottom. He expressed optimism about a potential Bitcoin breakout to $100,000 within the next two weeks.On the other hand, crypto trader Honey expected a steady rise for BTC, predicting a new all-time high of $111,111 by the end of Q2.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThere is minor resistance at $97,895, but if the level is crossed, the BTC/USDT pair could challenge the psychological resistance at $100,000. Sellers are expected to vigorously defend the level because a break above it could propel the pair to $107,000.Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could tumble to the 50-day simple moving average ($87,441).Ether price predictionThe bears are struggling to pull Ether (ETH) below the moving averages, indicating a lack of selling at lower levels.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBuyers will try to take advantage of the situation and push the price above the immediate resistance at $1,873. If they do that, the ETH/USDT pair could pick up momentum and soar toward $2,111. There is minor resistance at $1,957, but it is likely to be scaled. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to tug the price below the moving averages, opening the gates for a fall to $1,537. Buyers will try to defend the $1,537 level, but if they fail in their endeavor, the pair may collapse to the vital support at $1,368.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) fell below the moving averages on May 4, but the bears could not sink the price to the $2 support.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest that the XRP/USDT pair may remain stuck between the resistance line and the $2 support for some more time.A break and close above the resistance line signals a potential trend change. The pair could then rally toward $3. Conversely, a break and close below $2 opens the gates for a collapse to the $1.72 to $1.61 support zone.BNB price predictionThe failure of the bears to sustain BNB (BNB) below the moving averages indicates demand at lower levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will have to try and overcome the barrier at $620 to clear the path for a rally to the strong overhead resistance at $644. Sellers will try to halt the recovery at $644, but if the bulls prevail, the next stop could be $680.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the BNB/USDT pair turns down and breaks below the $576 support. That heightens the risk of a fall to $520. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend the $500 to $520 zone.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) is finding support at the moving averages, signaling a positive sentiment where dips are being purchased.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the $153 resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could climb to $180 and then to $200. That signals the pair may swing inside the large $110 to $260 range for a while.Sellers will have to drag the price below the 20-day EMA to prevent the upside. The pair could then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($133). That indicates a consolidation between $110 and $153 for a few days.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) has been clinging to the moving averages, signaling a balance between supply and demand.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price closes below the moving averages, the bears will try to pull the DOGE/USDT pair to the support of the range at $0.14. The bulls will attempt to keep the pair inside the range by buying near $0.14.On the upside, buyers will have to drive and maintain the price above $0.21 to suggest a short-term trend change. The pair could rally to $0.25 and subsequently to the pattern target of $0.28.Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) is witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers near the moving averages.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price moves up from the current level, it is expected to face selling at $0.75. A break and close above $0.75 could propel the pair to $0.83.On the downside, there is solid support at $0.58. If the price rebounds off $0.58, the ADA/USDT pair could form a range. Sellers will seize control on a break below the $0.58 support.

The pair risks dropping to the solid support at $2.86 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.61).Chainlink price predictionChainlink (LINK) is finding support at the 50-day SMA ($13.66), but the failure to start a strong rebound suggests the bears have kept up the pressure.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the 50-day SMA gives way, the LINK/USDT pair could slump to $11.68.

If the price turns down from the moving averages, the pair could fall to the support line of the descending channel.Contrarily, if the price turns up from the current level and maintains above the 20-day EMA ($13.99), the pair could rally toward the resistance line. Buyers will have to pierce the resistance line to signal that the downtrend could be over.Avalanche price predictionAvalanche (AVAX) has slipped below the 50-day SMA ($19.90), indicating that the range-bound action could continue for a few more days.  AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price skids below $18.50, the AVAX/USDT pair could drop to the support of the range at $15.27.

It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?The harsh reality is that decentralized social networks have largely failed to attract and retain mainstream users despite genuine enthusiasm from Web3 communities. The fundamental promise of user ownership, data portability, and monetization remains compelling — but deep structural issues bottleneck adoption.The technical hurdlesBlockchain infrastructure was never designed for the high-throughput, low-latency demands of social networking. Social media users expect instant results when posting pictures, liking comments, or following new accounts — actions that generate hundreds of millions of transactions daily across platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X.Consider this: Ethereum handles just 15-20 transactions per second (TPS). Even Solana — often touted as a high-performance chain — with ~5,000 TPS falls short. Compare that to TikTok's 25 million daily video uploads or X's 500 million daily posts. Adoption becomes impossible when users face 30-second confirmation delays to comment on a post or volatile gas fees ranging from 10 US cents to $50 during network congestion.Web2's hard-won lessons Meta spends $35 billion annually on research and development to refine its platforms' addictive simplicity. TikTok's algorithm, honed through 1 billion hours of daily user engagement, delivers content so frictionless that 47% of users open the app immediately upon waking. The result? Interfaces where the tech disappears behind the experience.By contrast, most SocialFi platforms confront new users with wallet popups, crypto slang, and variable fees. For mainstream users, it's confusing and intimidating. A 2023 DappRadar study found that 92% of SocialFi users abandon platforms within 30 days. Until SocialFi applications can match the frictionless experience of their Web2 counterparts while delivering unique advantages, adoption will remain limited to crypto natives.The fragmentation problemWeb3's multichain world has splintered SocialFi into silos. Lens Protocol's social graph doesn't integrate with Farcaster. Friend.tech's monetization tools don't port over to DeSo. The result? A fractured experience with no network effects.Recent: Avara’s Lens secures $31M for SocialFi-focused L2 blockchainConsider if Gmail users had to pay to email someone on Outlook — and couldn't bring their contacts or messages with them. That's today's SocialFi reality.To solve this, decentralized identity systems like ENS and emerging standards like EAS must power portable, composable social graphs. A user's content, followers, and reputation should travel with them — benefiting the broader ecosystem, not just one app.Purpose-built infrastructureThe solution to SocialFi's adoption challenges isn't incremental improvements to existing models but purpose-built infrastructure explicitly designed for social applications. Just as horizontal scaling revolutionized Web2 infrastructure, modular blockchain architecture that separates concerns like data availability, execution, and settlement creates the foundation for social applications that can scale to billions of users.The shift is already underway. Farcaster moved from Ethereum mainnet to Optimism's layer 2 stack, prioritizing low-cost social interactions. Lens Protocol is migrating to ZKsync, using zero-knowledge proofs to scale while preserving user privacy. CyberConnect launched Cyber, its own L1 chain optimized for social applications, which now supports faster, cheaper interactions with an embedded social graph.These purpose-built stacks mirror how Web2 scaled — separating data, execution, and storage to handle exponential growth. Web3's version is modular architecture: rollups for performance, decentralized storage for media, and identity layers like ENS or Lit Protocol.User-centric social networkingWhen built on the proper foundation, SocialFi can finally deliver on its core promise: putting users back at the center of the social networking experience. This means true ownership of identity and content, portable social graphs that work across applications, and fair value distribution to the people who create and curate content.The opportunity extends well beyond fixing what's broken in Web2 social media. True ownership enables creators to retain control and port audiences across platforms. Programmable money allows TikTok-esque viral trends to include instant revenue splits — imagine a dance challenge where 10% of ad revenue auto-splits among creators.Combining programmable money with social connections, new interaction models become possible — from seamless tipping for quality content to automated revenue sharing for collaborative creation.SocialFi's early iterations have failed to gain meaningful traction beyond crypto enthusiasts. If we finally address the fundamental technical and user experience barriers, Web3 Social can deliver a disproportionate advantage over established platforms only Web3 can offer.Opinion by: Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail.

2025-05-07T14:43:02.000Z,"Safeheron introduces open-source Intel SGX TEE framework for Web3 security","Safeheron, a digital asset infrastructure provider based in Singapore, has introduced an open-source Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework. This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.Related: Fully onchain AI agents can be the key to a more open AI future — Here’s why“We’re not threatened by competitors,” Safeheron CEO Wade Wang told Cointelegraph. “What worries us is slow innovation due to closed systems.”A critical technology for protecting code and data, Trusted Execution Environments create secure, isolated spaces within CPUs. These spaces are traditionally called “enclaves.” In these spaces, programs can run while protected from external attacks, including those coming from within the hardware.Some sectors of Web3 that employ TEEs include privacy-focused blockchains, oracles, DeFi, payments services, and exchanges. Oasis Network, Secret Network, and Phala Network are known for using TEEs. Other companies, such as Chainlink, are suspected of using TEEs.Safeheron's new TEE framework allows clients to use cloud services to create enclaves. Any cloud service, including those that are public, that supports Intel SGX servers will do.Safeheron has provided services over 100 clients, primarily payment providers, OTC desks, trading firms, and wallet service providers. Its clients include MetaMask, Doo Group, and Amber Group. According to the company, its cumulative transfer volume recently surpassed $100 billion.In August 2022, Safeheron raised $7 million in pre-Series A funding. The capital was allocated to research, development, and expanding the company’s business team.Related: Here’s how ‘confidential AI’ with blockchain and TEEs protects data privacyButerin proposes TEE for Ethereum privacyIn an April 11 roadmap, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed adding a TEE to the Ethereum ecosystem to enhance user privacy. The TEE would be a short-term solution allowing “users to interact with RPC nodes while getting stronger assurances that their private data is not being collected.” He also called for the addition of privacy-protecting tools to Ether (ETH) wallets. TEEs could help here as well by protecting private wallet keys. Announced at the time of its fundraise, Safeheron secured MetaMask as a client in August 2022.Another area in crypto where TEEs can help is Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge, or SNARKs. An August 2024 study by Imperial College London found that vulnerabilities in the circuit layer pose significant threats to these systems. TEEs could guard against any attacks coming from within the system.Magazine: Ethereum is destroying the competition in the $16.1T TradFi tokenization race",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/safeheron-intel-sgx-tee-framework-web3-security?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Analysts are watching these key levels","Key takeaways:XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.Whale accumulation supports bullish XRP viewCertain indicators show that XRP’s ongoing price rise may not be just a short-term reaction to the positive macroeconomic news. For instance, Santiment's Supply Distribution metric shows a steady rise in the supply held by entities with a 1 million –10 million token balance. These addresses now own 9.44% of the total XRP supply, a 1.2% increase since Jan. 1. Percentage of addresses holding between 1M and 100M XRP. Source: SantimentThis suggests that whales did not sell on the recent drop to $1.60 but accumulated XRP, suggesting most are positioning themselves for further gains.By purchasing during downturns, these large entities can reduce selling pressure and create a floor for the price, encouraging smaller retail investors to follow suit. Meanwhile, XRP open interest (OI) has seen a modest 0.32% rise to $3.65 billion over the last day, signaling a slight increase in trader confidence and liquidity. However, the 17% drop in trading volume to $3.9 billion is a cause for concern, suggesting low conviction as traders wait for the XRP price to establish a clear directional bias.XRP derivatives data. Source: CoinGlassXRP price to $4 all-time highs?Traders believe XRP can revisit its seven-year highs above $3.40 and beyond, but its potential to continue its gains depends on holding above key support levels. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that XRP price bounced off the 200-day SMA at $2.08 on May 6, rising as much as 4.5% to today’s intraday high of $2.17, which is also the 50-day SMA.Related: Why is XRP price down today?The 200-day SMA coincides with the election volume-weighted average price (VWAP) and the monthly rVWAP, as shown in the chart below.“This is an area that we want to see continue to get defended,” said trader and analyst Dom in a May 6 post on X, adding that failure to hold above this level could see XRP drop toward $1.90.“To see an immediate trend reversal, we need to see the price regain $2.12.”XRP/USD daily chart.

Source: CointelegraphFrom providing clarity to building skills From simplifying technical language to creating safe spaces for learning, women in Web3 said that demystifying crypto and making tools more intuitive can unlock more opportunities for women to enter the Web3 industry. Caroline York, the marketing director of Web3 firm Serotonin, said that making the space more welcoming to women starts with clarity. “In order to attract more women, we’ve got to make the information much more digestible and a lot clearer,” she said.York told Cointelegraph that women also tend to feel safer in high-trust and intimate environments, with friends and peers as their information source. “Women learn from other women,” York added, pointing to community-driven educational initiatives like SheFi. York said these programs play a role in expanding female participation in the space. Saima Tariq Khan, an engineer, educator and crypto community member, echoed York’s sentiments. Khan told Cointelegraph that demystifying crypto’s intimidating vocabulary is the way to go. “What is DeFi? What do I mean by cryptocurrency? What is blockchain? First, we need to build that first level of understanding,” she said. Khan also said that while many women graduate from computer science courses, they are underrepresented in the workforce.

Diversified reportedly denied that the site was abandoned, stating it may resume gas production.However, the DEP and environmental advocates say the company has failed to meet its obligations. Under a 2021 agreement, Diversified had committed to plugging Longhorn A and 13 other wells at the end of their operational life, an obligation it has reportedly not fulfilled.An image of the site. Source: The Erie Times-NewsCointelegraph has reached out to Diversified for comment.Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execDiversified under scrutiny over business modelEnvironmentalists have long raised concerns about Diversified’s business model, which involves acquiring aging, low-producing wells and extracting remaining value without sufficient plans for decommissioning.Plugging a single well can cost over $100,000, and Pennsylvania already has over 350,000 orphaned and abandoned wells, making the stakes particularly high.A 2022 report labeled the company’s approach a “business model built to fail Appalachia,” warning that taxpayers could be left footing the bill for thousands of unplugged wells.Diversified recently agreed to plug 3,000 wells by 2034 in a separate legal settlement but continues to face regulatory scrutiny, including a probe by the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce.Horton Township officials, where the Longhorn site is located, say they’ve received no updates from the company.Local supervisor PJ Piccirillo told the Erie Times-News that generators and tanks were removed without notice. “All we know is that the property seems to have been abandoned,” he said.Related: Bitcoin mining — Institutions boost investments amid favorable US climateUS cities confront crypto miningOn April 25, the planning commission of Vilonia, Arkansas, unanimously rejected a proposal to establish a cryptocurrency mining facility within the city limits, following strong opposition from residents.In January, Arkansas lawmakers introduced a bill that would ban crypto mining operations within 30 miles of any US military facility in the state.The opposition to crypto-mining centers in Arkansas follows a broader trend across various US municipalities where crypto-mining initiatives have faced increasing scrutiny.In October 2024, a group of residents in Granbury, Texas, filed a lawsuit against Marathon Digital, alleging that its mining facility generated too much noise.Magazine: 12 minutes of nail-biting tension when Ethereum’s Pectra fork goes live",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/diversified-energy-crypto-mine-abandonment-pennsylvania?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

With the product, qualified clients can access up to $1 million in loans while keeping their BTC.Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca at the Token2049 media lounge. Source: CointelegraphBitcoin-backed loans are an “obvious” next stepRocca told Cointelegraph that growing confidence in crypto’s long-term trajectory had fueled demand for the product. This has been driven by developments leading to broader institutional adoption. “Expectations are for institutional space coming in, the ETFs, and the mood music on Bitcoin is much more about wider adoption and long-term thinking than very short-term speculation,” Rocca said. He said this shift is the key to unlocking demand for borrowing against BTC, as investors feel more secure and feel that sharp price drops are less likely to happen. The Xapo Bank CEO said that its Bitcoin-backed loans offer loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of 20%, 30% and 40%, giving borrowers flexibility while managing risk. “If you get a 20% LTV loan and you have 100 Bitcoin, as a lot of early adopters do, that’s still a couple of million dollars you can borrow without having to sell them,” Rocca said. With conservative LTV levels like 20%, Bitcoin must fall below $40,000 for borrowers to get liquidated. “We’re nowhere near $40,000,” Rocca told Cointelegraph, pointing to the current price stability as a reason for growing borrower confidence.Related: Blockchains ready for institutions, lawyers hesitate: DoubleZero CEOBorrowing helps investors avoid selling in emergenciesRocca said Bitcoin-backed loans provide a solution for holders who want to stay exposed to BTC when facing life’s unexpected expenses. “If you follow the ethos of investing, the smart thing to do would be not to sell it in three days if it goes to $100,000,” Rocca said.“But life gets in the way,” Rocca added. He told Cointelegraph that unexpected costs, like medical bills or replacing a car, often force investors to liquidate assets at unfavorable times. Rocca said that instead of selling Bitcoin for a $10,000 expense, investors could borrow against their holdings while simply paying interest on the loan.“You continue to have the upside potential of the price appreciation of the Bitcoin because you haven’t sold it,” he said. “But you get liquidity to pay for things that you need in everyday life.”With institutional adoption deepening and the Bitcoin market maturing, the Xapo Bank executive is betting that more long-term holders will be ready to tap into crypto liquidity without selling their BTC. This marks a shift from the “hodl” culture to an age where Bitcoin owners can do more with the asset. Magazine: 12 minutes of nail-biting tension when Ethereum’s Pectra fork goes live",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-backed-loans-growth-xapo-bank-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Still, BTC miner Hive Digital Technologies is doubling down on the untapped potential of the Latin American (LATAM) market.In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Hive Digital Technologies’ president and CEO, Aydin Kilic, said that Paraguay presents a compelling long-term opportunity equipped with “geopolitical stability, low-cost hydro energy, and a government open to foreign investment”.Picking up from where Bitfarms left offHive acquired Bitfarms’ 200 megawatt (MW) Yguazú facility for $56 million in January. Phase one infrastructure of a 100 MW data center at the site was completed in April, supporting five exahashes per second (EH/s) of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining.Hive plans to expand to 300 MW of mining facilities in Paraguay in 2025. It aims to increase its hashrate to 25 EH/s by September.Related: Bitfarms sells Paraguay site to Hive for $85M, refocuses on USThe CEO said Hive has spent over a year cultivating strong, cooperative relationships with local stakeholders in Paraguay. “We are investing in local hiring, training programs and strong vendor partnerships. Our goal is to create a local ecosystem of support that keeps costs stable while boosting uptime and efficiency,” he added.While there was a proposed ban on crypto mining in Paraguay due to the pressure it poses on the country’s electricity supply and potential rising electricity prices, Aydin said that their team is actively involved with policymakers to support clarity and cooperation in mining legislation.Hive embraces global diversification to hedge against geopolitical risksHive has data centers in Canada, Sweden and Paraguay.

2025-05-07T08:57:28.000Z,"Ethereum’s ‘Pectra’ network upgrade goes live: What to expect","Ethereum — the network that unleashed smart contracts on the world — moves on to the next chapter with today’s Pectra upgrade, but what does it mean?Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.Ethereum Pectra Consensys announcement. Source: ConsensysEIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.Finally, EIP-7691 increases the number of data blobs per block, which allows for better layer-2 scalability and potentially significantly reduces transaction fees. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of Ethereum decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch, said Pectra “introduces ‘smart account’ functionality” at deeper protocol levels and “improves Ethereum’s scalability” through layer-2 solutions.Related: Ethereum to simplify crosschain transactions with new token standardsBetter account abstraction0xAw, lead developer at Base Ethereum layer-2 DEX Alien.Base told Cointelegraph that EIP‑7702 “is a potentially great addition for Ethereum.” He said that account abstraction has so far been unable to gain traction due to the need to switch wallets.The positives of adopting such a solution include “getting rid of approval flows, not having to sign each transaction, segregated permissions and actions, and automations on behalf of the user.” 0xAw added that, following the update, developers will have an easier time implementing the features.While account abstraction “won’t magically result in mass adoption,” it still “does remove a significant barrier to entry for new people.” He added:“It enables a Web2-like UX by hiding many of the underlying scaffolding from users.”1inch’s Kunz highlighted that the update will pave “the way for native gasless transactions and simplified user flows.” Ivo Georgiev, founder and CEO of self-custodial smart wallet Ambire, told Cointelegraph that “there will be no more infinite ERC-20 approvals, and users won’t need native currency like ETH to pay transaction gas fees.” He added:“Following this, the UX will be reworked completely, with permissions/delegations systems that let wallets give more limited abilities to apps, thus increasing their overall security — for example, you won’t need the wallet popup every time you interact with OpenSea.“Still, the change is not without its downsides. According to 0xAw, it gives “users have one more dangerous thing they could sign, which would be even more damaging than an approval to wallet drainers.”Mike Tiutin, chief technology officer at onchain compliance protocol PureFi, told Cointelegraph that “drainers proved that users will sign ‘harmless’ messages in cloned DApps.” The risk will now get worse:“EIP-7702 expands that trick from one token to the whole wallet.“Georgiev is more optimistic, saying he is “confident there will not be a tangible increase in risk.” He explained, “By this point, the industry knows how to create a secure contract, especially with such a minimal scope as an EIP-7702 delegation.”Related: Vitalik wants to make Ethereum ‘as simple as Bitcoin’ in 5 yearsEasier institutional stakingArtemiy Parshakov, vice president of institutions at Ethereum staking service P2P.org, told Cointelegraph, “EIP-7002 makes institutional staking much easier to integrate without taking too much risk.” Staking service clients had to obtain a signed message from their staking service provider to be able to exit and store it securely for later.Until Pectra, stakers could not exit without the participation of the staking service provider. Those messages also couldn’t be generated until about 13 hours after starting staking — now this exit delay will be decreased to about 13 minutes.Supply validator deposits onchainAnother notable upgrade is EIP-6110. This makes the execution‑layer block carry data about new validator deposits to the consensus layer. Validator deposits are new validators joining Ethereum’s staking protocol.Until Pectra, consensus clients waited for block proposers to vote on a Merkle root that summarized deposits. Now, the execution-layer block includes (supplies) a list of new verifier deposits. This sort of upgrade makes changes very deep into Ethereum’s consensus layer, and its introduction follows client bugs breaking the Holesky and Sepolia Ethereum test networks. Still, Parshakov explained that his firm’s biggest concern “are client bugs, but we trust that respectable teams and the Ethereum Foundation are working together to prevent it from happening on mainnet.”Magazine: 12 minutes of nail-biting tension when Ethereum’s Pectra fork goes live",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-s-pectra-network-upgrade-goes-live-today-what-to-expect?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-07T08:53:00.000Z,"What is Tornado Cash, and why did it get into trouble?","What is Tornado Cash?              Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a different address. The protocol was launched to boost privacy in Ethereum-based transactions. Over time, the developers have expanded its functionality to support multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains, including BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum and Avalanche.Tornado Cash supports several ERC-20 tokens and native ETH across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. At its peak usage, Tornado Cash supported several ERC-20 tokens, including:On Ethereum: Ether (ETH), Dai (DAI), USDC (USDC), Tether’s USDt (USDT), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).On other EVM chains (via smart contract deployment): BNB (BNB), Polygon (POL), Avalanche (AVAX) and ETH on Arbitrum and Optimism.Did you know? Tornado Cash launched in 2019 as an experiment in financial privacy using just a few smart contracts. By 2022, it had processed billions in crypto transactions without ever holding user funds directly.                  How Tornado Cash works              Unlike traditional financial systems that prioritize users’ privacy, blockchain public ledgers are accessible to everyone on blockchain explorers. Tornado Cash counters this by enabling anonymous transactions through smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs.Crypto mixers typically pool and shuffle users’ funds, deduct a fee, and redistribute them. Tornado Cash, however, uses a pool-based system where deposits are commingled in a smart contract, and withdrawals to new addresses are delinked using zk-SNARKs, ensuring anonymity without random shuffling.Here’s how it works:At its core, Tornado Cash has smart contracts that break the onchain link between a sender and receiver. When a user deposits a cryptocurrency into a Tornado Cash pool, the smart contract issues a cryptographic note that the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a different wallet address without revealing the link between the two.As Tornado Cash is a decentralized protocol, the underlying smart contracts cannot be changed or destroyed by anyone, including the Tornado Cash decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).The system uses ZK-proofs, which allow a user to prove that they have the right to withdraw a specific amount without revealing what deposit was theirs. This mechanism ensures that deposits and withdrawals are mathematically linked but anonymous.Tornado Cash is non-custodial, meaning it does not hold user funds at any point. The code runs independently and cannot be altered or controlled by the developers. The funds can remain in the pool for as long as the user likes.Before sanctions, Tornado Cash was primarily accessed via its web interface by connecting a crypto wallet. Advanced users could also interact with the protocol’s smart contracts directly using a command-line interface.                  How Tornado Cash got into trouble              Tornado Cash landed in legal trouble primarily because it was allegedly used to launder billions of dollars in illicit funds, including crypto stolen in high-profile hacks. The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash on Aug. 8, 2022, under Executive Order 13694.There were several reasons behind Tornado Cash facing issues with regulators: Facilitation of money laundering: Tornado Cash was accused of facilitating money laundering, with the OFAC claiming it processed over $7 billion in virtual currency since 2019, approximately 30% of which was linked to illicit activity, per Chainalysis.Support for North Korean cybercrime: The platform was linked to laundering more than $455 million stolen by the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group.Threat to national security: The OFAC accused Tornado Cash of materially assisting cyber-enabled activities originating outside the US, posing a significant threat to US national security, foreign policy and economic stability.Lack of effective controls: The Treasury highlighted Tornado Cash’s failure to implement adequate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures, allowing malicious actors to exploit it.Obfuscation of illicit transactions: According to the OFAC, Tornado Cash was facilitating anonymous transactions by obscuring their origin, destination and counterparties, enabling criminals to hide the proceeds of cybercrimes.Tornado Cash was designed to obfuscate the entire transaction history. This feature was beneficial for privacy, particularly in use cases like payroll, donations and personal spending, where anonymity can be important. However, the very feature that made it attractive for legitimate use also made it appealing to bad actors looking to launder money or conceal illicit transactions. This drew significant attention from regulators, who became concerned about the potential for criminal activities such as money laundering, terrorism financing or other forms of illicit finance.On March 21, 2025, the US Treasury lifted sanctions imposed by the Biden administration against Tornado Cash. Did you know? In August 2022, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash smart contracts, marking the first time code, not a person or organization, was blacklisted. This sparked a heated global debate over open-source freedom.                  Debate around Tornado Cash              The action against Tornado Cash followed similar sanctions against Blender.io in May 2022, signaling a broader regulatory push to address cryptocurrency mixers. Such actions sparked a controversy in the crypto community. Critics of regulatory actions on the decentralized crypto mixers argue that sanctioning open-source code and punishing developers for creating privacy-preserving tools pose a threat to free speech and innovation. It undermines the neutrality of blockchain tools and sets a precedent where governments could censor software itself, not just its use.On the other hand, advocates of hardened regulatory sanctions say it is a necessary step to combat crypto-related crime and that illicit activity cannot be left unchecked. While the protocol does have legitimate uses, the scale of its illicit use, nearly 30% of funds tied to illicit actors, outweighed these benefits. They argue that the decentralized, non-custodial nature of the smart contracts in such protocols, which cannot be modified or controlled, complicates efforts to mitigate misuse. This leaves regulators with no option but to take action against the protocol itself to deter similar platforms from operating without safeguards.The Treasury held that the platform consistently failed to implement effective controls to prevent money laundering by malicious cyber actors. This lack of oversight allowed illicit actors to exploit the service without restriction, prompting the need for regulatory intervention to curb unchecked abuse.Nevertheless, the case has set up pressing questions about how to balance financial privacy with security and how decentralized, permissionless systems can coexist with traditional legal frameworks.Did you know? The Tornado Cash protocol is governed by a DAO, allowing tokenholders to vote on upgrades and proposals. Even after sanctions, the DAO continued to operate briefly on-chain.                  The efficacy of “sanctions” and their removal              Despite sanctions, Tornado Cash remained operational through decentralized technologies like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Tor. Its resilience led to doubts around the efficacy of sanctions on decentralized protocols and the broader implications for crypto regulation under evolving US policy.According to Chainalysis, Tornado Cash kept functioning on the dark web despite the sanctions. Its front end was available on the IPFS and via The Onion Router (known as Tor). IPFS is a peer-to-peer, distributed protocol for data storage and sharing, while Tor is open-source software enabling anonymous communication, often called the dark web.Per Flipside Crypto data, Tornado Cash saw $1.9 billion in deposits between Jan. 1 and June 30 in 2024, compared to $635.696 million in deposits during the same period in 2023.Unlike centralized services, Tornado Cash is decentralized and autonomous, making it difficult to shut down or control. But the US government targeted associated infrastructure, including GitHub repositories and websites. Developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested in the Netherlands on suspicion of concealing illicit financial flows and facilitating money laundering. Two of the co-founders, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, were charged in 2023 for involvement in more than $1 billion in money laundering.A Dutch court later suspended Pertsev’s pretrial detention. A US court determined that Tornado Cash’s smart contracts aren’t “property,” though legal experts note this doesn’t clear the founders of other charges. High-profile figures like Vitalik Buterin and Edward Snowden have publicly supported Pertsev in the matter.The Treasury stated that a review of legal and policy issues regarding sanctions in “evolving technology and legal environments” led to the repeal of sanctions. In January 2025, a US court overturned the sanctions. The ruling came after Joseph Van Loon and other Tornado Cash users filed an appeal against the sanctions, arguing that the OFAC had overstepped its congressional authority by blacklisting the mixer in 2022.In April 2025, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the US Treasury Department’s sanctions against Tornado Cash were unlawful and barred the agency from reimposing them on the crypto mixer.                  Tornado Cash sanctions repeal: What’s next for crypto privacy?              The repeal of sanctions on Tornado Cash marks a pivotal moment for decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto privacy. It underscores the challenges of regulating permissionless, immutable systems while highlighting the growing legal recognition of code as distinct from traditional property or entities.For users, the lifting of sanctions restores access to a tool designed for financial privacy, potentially boosting adoption for legitimate use cases like shielding personal transactions or protecting sensitive donations.However, the repeal does not resolve the underlying tension between privacy and regulatory oversight. Tornado Cash’s continued operation, even during sanctions, demonstrates the resilience of decentralized protocols but also their vulnerability to misuse. Regulators worldwide are likely to scrutinize similar platforms, pushing for stronger AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) frameworks, even in DeFi. This could lead to hybrid solutions where privacy tools incorporate voluntary compliance mechanisms to deter illicit activity without compromising user autonomy.For Tornado Cash itself, the future remains uncertain. While the protocol’s smart contracts are immutable, its governance via the Tornado Cash DAO could evolve to address regulatory concerns, such as implementing optional transparency features for compliant users. The legal battles of its developers — Pertsev, Storm and Semenov — are ongoing, and their outcomes could shape public perception and trust in the platform. A guilty verdict could deter developers from building similar tools, while acquittals might embolden innovation in privacy-focused DeFi.The Tornado Cash saga has also sparked broader discussions about the right to financial privacy in the digital age. Advocates argue that privacy is a fundamental right, especially in an era of pervasive blockchain surveillance, where every transaction is traceable by default. Critics, however, emphasize the societal cost of unchecked anonymity, pointing to cases like the Lazarus Group’s exploits. Striking a balance will require collaboration between developers, regulators and the crypto community to ensure privacy tools serve legitimate users without becoming havens for crime.As the crypto landscape evolves, Tornado Cash will likely influence the next generation of privacy protocols. Emerging technologies, such as advanced ZK-proofs or layer-2 scaling solutions, could enable even more robust privacy guarantees while addressing regulatory concerns. For now, the repeal of sanctions offers a reprieve for Tornado Cash and its users, but it also sets the stage for a new chapter in the ongoing debate over privacy, security and the future of decentralized finance.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-tornado-cash-and-why-did-it-get-into-trouble?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
