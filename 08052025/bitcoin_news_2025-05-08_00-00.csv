Two crypto firms, Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, are reportedly vying to become partners in the project. Tokenization is the process of turning real-world assets, like stocks, real estate, or commodities, into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.Tokenizing securities instead of providing direct exposure can offer several advantages: reduced costs by eliminating traditional financial infrastructure, enhanced accessibility, faster settlement times, and quicker transactions. More brokerages and investment firms are exploring asset tokenization.Robinhood has been preparing to enter the European market. In April 2025, it acquired a brokerage license in Lithuania that allows the firm to offer investment services throughout the European Union. Robinhood has also inked a deal in 2024 to purchase crypto exchange Bitstamp.“You can sit down in front of some software, create a coin and have it be trading in 5 minutes [...] That’s a scary thing,” Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev said in a recent interview. “It’s also an incredibly powerful thing if you juxtapose it with how cumbersome the IPO process is.”Robinhood shares rose 2.7% on the Nasdaq on May 7, according to Google Finance.

2025-05-07T21:30:00.000Z,"Falling DXY part of US financial system’s ‘long-term transition’ — Will Bitcoin continue to shine?","What to know:Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?The trouble is, this might not be a temporary dip. The dollar’s slide could reflect a deeper, long-term reconfiguration of both the US economy and the global monetary order. In a May 4 newsletter, independent market analyst Lyn Alden made a compelling case: not only is a weaker dollar likely, but it may be necessary. According to Alden, a controlled retreat from dollar hegemony might be one of the few paths left to stabilize an increasingly fragile system. And if the US relinquishes its role at the center of the monetary universe, the world will need alternatives. Neutral assets like gold and Bitcoin could be well-positioned to take on a more central role.The US and the dollar are in a “long-term transition”Fractional reserve banking, the system that fiat money relies on, creates money through lending. Each time a bank issues a loan, it expands the supply of broad money, without necessarily creating enough base money to cover the loan principal and its interest. This means that the current financial system relies on continual credit expansion and refinancing to remain solvent.Today, the US economy holds around $102 trillion in public and private dollar-denominated debt, with another $18 trillion owed by borrowers outside the US And that’s not even counting derivatives, which would push the total much higher. Yet only $5.8 trillion in base money actually exists.“It’s like a game of musical chairs with more than 20 kids for every chair,” Alden writes. “And the music can’t stop for long.”The US plays a special role in this system. It imports more than it exports, while surplus countries funnel their dollar earnings back into American stocks, bonds, real estate, and private equity. For the $18 trillion in dollar liabilities held abroad, non-US entities hold roughly $61 trillion in US dollar assets. But when dollar liquidity tightens — when the music stops — foreign holders often have to sell those assets to service their debts, which, in turn, threatens US financial stability.This happened in March 2020, when parts of the Treasury market froze during the peak panic stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Fed stepped in, quickly opening emergency swap lines with foreign central banks and printing trillions in base money to re-float the system. That solved the liquidity issue but unleashed inflation, hitting lower-income Americans the hardest.Combined with decades of industrial decline and widening social gaps, this situation eventually created the political mandate for Donald Trump and his protectionist agenda. However, the tariff shock is unlikely to be successful, Alden argues. The current system implies that the US must run structural trade deficits to provide the global economy with enough dollars to keep the greenback’s dominance. The only way of rebalancing trade flows is through a weak dollar and a step back from monetary hegemony.As Alden puts it,“I view the United States and indeed the global financial system as likely beginning a very long-term transition.”The Bitcoin to DXY relationshipBitcoin (BTC) and DXY are inversely correlated. When the dollar strengthens, risk-on assets like BTC lose some of their appeal to investors. When the dollar weakens, BTC becomes more attractive not just as a speculative play, but as an alternative currency. In a system where fiat must effectively lose value over time to function, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and monetary neutrality offer a compelling hedge.Overlaying BTC and DXY charts reveals that major divergences between the two often align with Bitcoin trend reversals. In April 2018 and March 2022, such divergences signaled bear markets, while November 2020 marked the start of a bullish rally. In the 2023-2026 cycle, BTC caught up with the DXY in early 2024, and the two moved largely in sync until recently. A clear divergence began at the beginning of April 2025, with the DXY dropping below 100 for the first time in two years. If past patterns are any guide, this could signal the start of a new BTC rally. And if the US moves to strategically weaken the dollar in the long term, the impact could extend well beyond Bitcoin’s usual cyclical price action.DXY vs BTC/USD 1-day. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewRelated: How much Bitcoin can Berkshire Hathaway buy?Where to invest in a post-dollar era?Periods of monetary upheaval are notoriously difficult to navigate. While short-term tactics may differ, longer-term strategies point to neutral, high-quality reserve assets — especially those that stand to benefit structurally from de-dollarization.Gold fits this bill. So does Bitcoin.Several sovereign entities are already stockpiling Bitcoin. El Salvador and Bhutan are directly buying and mining BTC. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. and the US state of Wisconsin’s pension fund have exposure via spot BTC ETFs. A dozen US states hold equity in Michael Saylor’s Strategy, as well as over 13,000 companies and institutions. Even Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, has Bitcoin exposure through its holdings of Strategy, Mara Holdings, Coinbase, and Riot.With the dollar retreating from the global financial arena, space will open for other currencies. There are more and more examples of international trade deals settled in yuan, dirham, or other national currencies. Reuters reports that cross-border yuan payments surged to a record in March. The euro is also on the rise, gaining 10% against the dollar since February. This is all the more impressive taking into account that the European Central Bank has been continuously cutting interest rates, which now stand at just 2.5%, far below the Fed’s 4.5%.The much-debated \""de-dollarization\"" is no longer hypothetical. It’s unfolding in real time. As nations and companies search for stable, neutral alternatives to settle trade and store value, Bitcoin’s borderless and politically neutral nature positions it as a serious contender. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The former CEO, as well as SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and former chief technology officer Thomas Smith, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of the platform’s SFM token.According to reporting from the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) on May 6, Karony implied that Nagy, who reportedly fled to Russia after authorities filed charges, was responsible for some of the alleged fraud at SafeMoon. On the first day of the trial, after jury selection, Smith reportedly appeared as a witness for the prosecution with a SafeMoon victim.The trial, expected to run until May 26, has arguably received less media attention and scrutiny than other crypto cases, such as the 2023 trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and the sentencing of former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Karony pleaded not guilty to charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, and has been free on a $3 million bond since February 2024.Related: What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?Many high-profile individuals from the crypto industry who faced criminal charges did not publicly comment on social media until the conclusion of their cases, likely on the advice of counsel.

It has a market capitalization of nearly $85 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.Meanwhile, asset manager VanEck proposed on May 5 the first BNB ETF in the United States.

As of May 7, BNB Chain ranks fourth among layer-1 blockchain networks by TVL, the data shows. According to Standard Chartered, BNB Chain’s “use cases remain almost entirely on decentralised exchanges [DEXs], lending protocols, and liquid staking. This makes it a much more concentrated and ‘old-fashioned’ smart contract platform than rivals,” it said in a May research note reviewed by Cointelegraph.“While this caps upside potential, it also provides a degree of stability,” according to the asset manager. PancakeSwap is among BNB Chain’s largest DEXs, with roughly $1.5 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.USD1 on BNB Chain vs. Ethereum.

The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.Ether 30-day futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe ETH futures premium has remained below the 5% neutral threshold, indicating a lack of appetite from leveraged bulls. More significantly, this indicator was unchanged at 3% after the Pectra upgrade, suggesting traders did not adjust their positions despite the upgrade’s successful deployment. The subdued response can be partly explained by investors’ focus on macroeconomic issues, as recession risks arise amid uncertainty in global trade disputes. But traders’ lack of interest in Ether predates the recent worsening of risk aversion conditions. In fact, ETH underperformed the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization by 28% in the first three months of 2025. The lackluster price impact following the Pectra upgrade reflects broader dissatisfaction, as competing blockchains have gained traction.Solana monthly active addresses vs. layer-1 competitors. Source: Token TerminalHistorically, high Ethereum base layer fees may have limited network activity, but these costs have dropped below $1 since mid-February. Additionally, Ethereum’s leading layer-2 solution, Base, currently boasts 10.3 million monthly active users-far fewer than Solana’s 82.2 million and BNB Chain’s 25.9 million, according to Token Terminal data.Ethereum lags in DApp interoperability — Will it hurt ETH price? Solana has dominated the decentralized exchange sector, particularly in token launches, by offering an integrated user experience. Similarly, Hyperliquid has exceeded expectations in perpetual futures trading, demonstrating that traders’ primary focus is not necessarily on Ethereum’s decentralization and security. Meanwhile, Tron has made significant inroads in the stablecoin market.Blockchains and DApps 30-day fees, USD. Source: DefiLlamaEthereum’s leadership in total value locked (TVL) remains undisputed at $53.7 billion. However, this has provided little benefit to ETH holders, as network fees have been relatively low at $19 million over the past 30 days, according to DefiLlama. For comparison, Tron has amassed $51.8 million in fees in the same period, while Solana has accrued $39.4 million.Source: X/ProbablyNoamNoam Hurwitz, head of engineering at Alchemy, noted that Ethereum blob fees have dropped to their lowest possible level since the Pectra upgrade. For Hurwitz, Ether’s success depends on base layer scalability, including further improvements in the rollup mechanism, and ultimately, a more seamless user experience.Related: Standard Chartered predicts BNB will more than double in 2025Bridging assets and data across Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem has long been a challenge, while users on Solana and BNB Chain can easily switch between multiple decentralized applications (DApps). The Pectra upgrade, while a step in the right direction, does not resolve this issue, which explains why ETH has been unable to reclaim the $2,200 level seen in early March.For Ether’s price to climb 22% from its current $1,810 level, investors likely need reassurance that the network’s progress, whether through deposits or layer-2 growth, translates into clear benefits. Ultimately, improved staking yields or stronger incentives are needed to drive broader adoption of DApps, which in turn would generate increased demand for ETH within the ecosystem.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

However, if BTC breaks above the resistance zone of $97,000 to $99,000, the higher time frame (HTF) outlook could tilt toward bulls.Bitcoin 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThis resistance area carries weight due to a price cluster formed in Q1, which previously led to a downward move. If BTC price clears $99,000, it might shift market dynamics, potentially pressuring short positions and adding to bullish liquidity.The $100,000 level appears to be more of a psychological marker than a significant resistance level. If BTC surpasses the $97,000-$99,000 resistance and establishes it as support, it could pave the way for a move toward $110,000, although this would depend on market conditions and momentum.Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, suggested that the dip below $94,000 and subsequent recovery may indicate a market bottom. He expressed optimism about a potential Bitcoin breakout to $100,000 within the next two weeks.On the other hand, crypto trader Honey expected a steady rise for BTC, predicting a new all-time high of $111,111 by the end of Q2.

Are select altcoins showing signs of a short-term up move? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin rebounded off the 20-day exponential moving average ($93,091) on May 6, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThere is minor resistance at $97,895, but if the level is crossed, the BTC/USDT pair could challenge the psychological resistance at $100,000. Sellers are expected to vigorously defend the level because a break above it could propel the pair to $107,000.Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could tumble to the 50-day simple moving average ($87,441).Ether price predictionThe bears are struggling to pull Ether (ETH) below the moving averages, indicating a lack of selling at lower levels.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBuyers will try to take advantage of the situation and push the price above the immediate resistance at $1,873. If they do that, the ETH/USDT pair could pick up momentum and soar toward $2,111. There is minor resistance at $1,957, but it is likely to be scaled. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to tug the price below the moving averages, opening the gates for a fall to $1,537. Buyers will try to defend the $1,537 level, but if they fail in their endeavor, the pair may collapse to the vital support at $1,368.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) fell below the moving averages on May 4, but the bears could not sink the price to the $2 support.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest that the XRP/USDT pair may remain stuck between the resistance line and the $2 support for some more time.A break and close above the resistance line signals a potential trend change. The pair could then rally toward $3. Conversely, a break and close below $2 opens the gates for a collapse to the $1.72 to $1.61 support zone.BNB price predictionThe failure of the bears to sustain BNB (BNB) below the moving averages indicates demand at lower levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will have to try and overcome the barrier at $620 to clear the path for a rally to the strong overhead resistance at $644. Sellers will try to halt the recovery at $644, but if the bulls prevail, the next stop could be $680.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the BNB/USDT pair turns down and breaks below the $576 support. That heightens the risk of a fall to $520. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend the $500 to $520 zone.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) is finding support at the moving averages, signaling a positive sentiment where dips are being purchased.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the $153 resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could climb to $180 and then to $200. That signals the pair may swing inside the large $110 to $260 range for a while.Sellers will have to drag the price below the 20-day EMA to prevent the upside. The pair could then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($133). That indicates a consolidation between $110 and $153 for a few days.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) has been clinging to the moving averages, signaling a balance between supply and demand.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price closes below the moving averages, the bears will try to pull the DOGE/USDT pair to the support of the range at $0.14. The bulls will attempt to keep the pair inside the range by buying near $0.14.On the upside, buyers will have to drive and maintain the price above $0.21 to suggest a short-term trend change. The pair could rally to $0.25 and subsequently to the pattern target of $0.28.Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) is witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers near the moving averages.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price moves up from the current level, it is expected to face selling at $0.75. A break and close above $0.75 could propel the pair to $0.83.On the downside, there is solid support at $0.58. If the price rebounds off $0.58, the ADA/USDT pair could form a range. Sellers will seize control on a break below the $0.58 support.

Sellers are expected to defend the $3.90 level with all their might because a break above it could propel the SUI/USDT pair to $4.25 and eventually to $5.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit. The pair risks dropping to the solid support at $2.86 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.61).Chainlink price predictionChainlink (LINK) is finding support at the 50-day SMA ($13.66), but the failure to start a strong rebound suggests the bears have kept up the pressure.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the 50-day SMA gives way, the LINK/USDT pair could slump to $11.68. Buyers will try to defend the level, but the relief rally is likely to face selling at the moving averages. If the price turns down from the moving averages, the pair could fall to the support line of the descending channel.Contrarily, if the price turns up from the current level and maintains above the 20-day EMA ($13.99), the pair could rally toward the resistance line. Buyers will have to pierce the resistance line to signal that the downtrend could be over.Avalanche price predictionAvalanche (AVAX) has slipped below the 50-day SMA ($19.90), indicating that the range-bound action could continue for a few more days.  AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price skids below $18.50, the AVAX/USDT pair could drop to the support of the range at $15.27.

2025-05-07T15:00:00.000Z,"SocialFi has failed to take off — Here&#039;s what needs to change","Opinion by: Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?The harsh reality is that decentralized social networks have largely failed to attract and retain mainstream users despite genuine enthusiasm from Web3 communities. The fundamental promise of user ownership, data portability, and monetization remains compelling — but deep structural issues bottleneck adoption.The technical hurdlesBlockchain infrastructure was never designed for the high-throughput, low-latency demands of social networking. Social media users expect instant results when posting pictures, liking comments, or following new accounts — actions that generate hundreds of millions of transactions daily across platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X.Consider this: Ethereum handles just 15-20 transactions per second (TPS). Even Solana — often touted as a high-performance chain — with ~5,000 TPS falls short. Compare that to TikTok's 25 million daily video uploads or X's 500 million daily posts. Adoption becomes impossible when users face 30-second confirmation delays to comment on a post or volatile gas fees ranging from 10 US cents to $50 during network congestion.Web2's hard-won lessons Meta spends $35 billion annually on research and development to refine its platforms' addictive simplicity. TikTok's algorithm, honed through 1 billion hours of daily user engagement, delivers content so frictionless that 47% of users open the app immediately upon waking. The result? Interfaces where the tech disappears behind the experience.By contrast, most SocialFi platforms confront new users with wallet popups, crypto slang, and variable fees. For mainstream users, it's confusing and intimidating. A 2023 DappRadar study found that 92% of SocialFi users abandon platforms within 30 days. Until SocialFi applications can match the frictionless experience of their Web2 counterparts while delivering unique advantages, adoption will remain limited to crypto natives.The fragmentation problemWeb3's multichain world has splintered SocialFi into silos. Lens Protocol's social graph doesn't integrate with Farcaster. Friend.tech's monetization tools don't port over to DeSo. The result? A fractured experience with no network effects.Recent: Avara’s Lens secures $31M for SocialFi-focused L2 blockchainConsider if Gmail users had to pay to email someone on Outlook — and couldn't bring their contacts or messages with them. That's today's SocialFi reality.To solve this, decentralized identity systems like ENS and emerging standards like EAS must power portable, composable social graphs. A user's content, followers, and reputation should travel with them — benefiting the broader ecosystem, not just one app.Purpose-built infrastructureThe solution to SocialFi's adoption challenges isn't incremental improvements to existing models but purpose-built infrastructure explicitly designed for social applications. Just as horizontal scaling revolutionized Web2 infrastructure, modular blockchain architecture that separates concerns like data availability, execution, and settlement creates the foundation for social applications that can scale to billions of users.The shift is already underway. Farcaster moved from Ethereum mainnet to Optimism's layer 2 stack, prioritizing low-cost social interactions. Lens Protocol is migrating to ZKsync, using zero-knowledge proofs to scale while preserving user privacy. CyberConnect launched Cyber, its own L1 chain optimized for social applications, which now supports faster, cheaper interactions with an embedded social graph.These purpose-built stacks mirror how Web2 scaled — separating data, execution, and storage to handle exponential growth. Web3's version is modular architecture: rollups for performance, decentralized storage for media, and identity layers like ENS or Lit Protocol.User-centric social networkingWhen built on the proper foundation, SocialFi can finally deliver on its core promise: putting users back at the center of the social networking experience. This means true ownership of identity and content, portable social graphs that work across applications, and fair value distribution to the people who create and curate content.The opportunity extends well beyond fixing what's broken in Web2 social media. True ownership enables creators to retain control and port audiences across platforms. Programmable money allows TikTok-esque viral trends to include instant revenue splits — imagine a dance challenge where 10% of ad revenue auto-splits among creators.Combining programmable money with social connections, new interaction models become possible — from seamless tipping for quality content to automated revenue sharing for collaborative creation.SocialFi's early iterations have failed to gain meaningful traction beyond crypto enthusiasts. If we finally address the fundamental technical and user experience barriers, Web3 Social can deliver a disproportionate advantage over established platforms only Web3 can offer.Opinion by: Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail.

2025-05-07T14:43:02.000Z,"Safeheron introduces open-source Intel SGX TEE framework for Web3 security","Safeheron, a digital asset infrastructure provider based in Singapore, has introduced an open-source Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework. This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.Related: Fully onchain AI agents can be the key to a more open AI future — Here’s why“We’re not threatened by competitors,” Safeheron CEO Wade Wang told Cointelegraph. “What worries us is slow innovation due to closed systems.”A critical technology for protecting code and data, Trusted Execution Environments create secure, isolated spaces within CPUs. These spaces are traditionally called “enclaves.” In these spaces, programs can run while protected from external attacks, including those coming from within the hardware.Some sectors of Web3 that employ TEEs include privacy-focused blockchains, oracles, DeFi, payments services, and exchanges. Oasis Network, Secret Network, and Phala Network are known for using TEEs. Other companies, such as Chainlink, are suspected of using TEEs.Safeheron's new TEE framework allows clients to use cloud services to create enclaves. Any cloud service, including those that are public, that supports Intel SGX servers will do.Safeheron has provided services over 100 clients, primarily payment providers, OTC desks, trading firms, and wallet service providers. Its clients include MetaMask, Doo Group, and Amber Group. According to the company, its cumulative transfer volume recently surpassed $100 billion.In August 2022, Safeheron raised $7 million in pre-Series A funding. The capital was allocated to research, development, and expanding the company’s business team.Related: Here’s how ‘confidential AI’ with blockchain and TEEs protects data privacyButerin proposes TEE for Ethereum privacyIn an April 11 roadmap, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed adding a TEE to the Ethereum ecosystem to enhance user privacy.

Analysts are watching these key levels","Key takeaways:XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.Whale accumulation supports bullish XRP viewCertain indicators show that XRP’s ongoing price rise may not be just a short-term reaction to the positive macroeconomic news. For instance, Santiment's Supply Distribution metric shows a steady rise in the supply held by entities with a 1 million –10 million token balance. These addresses now own 9.44% of the total XRP supply, a 1.2% increase since Jan. 1. Percentage of addresses holding between 1M and 100M XRP. Source: SantimentThis suggests that whales did not sell on the recent drop to $1.60 but accumulated XRP, suggesting most are positioning themselves for further gains.By purchasing during downturns, these large entities can reduce selling pressure and create a floor for the price, encouraging smaller retail investors to follow suit. Meanwhile, XRP open interest (OI) has seen a modest 0.32% rise to $3.65 billion over the last day, signaling a slight increase in trader confidence and liquidity. However, the 17% drop in trading volume to $3.9 billion is a cause for concern, suggesting low conviction as traders wait for the XRP price to establish a clear directional bias.XRP derivatives data. Source: CoinGlassXRP price to $4 all-time highs?Traders believe XRP can revisit its seven-year highs above $3.40 and beyond, but its potential to continue its gains depends on holding above key support levels. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that XRP price bounced off the 200-day SMA at $2.08 on May 6, rising as much as 4.5% to today’s intraday high of $2.17, which is also the 50-day SMA.Related: Why is XRP price down today?The 200-day SMA coincides with the election volume-weighted average price (VWAP) and the monthly rVWAP, as shown in the chart below.“This is an area that we want to see continue to get defended,” said trader and analyst Dom in a May 6 post on X, adding that failure to hold above this level could see XRP drop toward $1.90.“To see an immediate trend reversal, we need to see the price regain $2.12.”XRP/USD daily chart.

Source: CointelegraphFrom providing clarity to building skills From simplifying technical language to creating safe spaces for learning, women in Web3 said that demystifying crypto and making tools more intuitive can unlock more opportunities for women to enter the Web3 industry. Caroline York, the marketing director of Web3 firm Serotonin, said that making the space more welcoming to women starts with clarity. “In order to attract more women, we’ve got to make the information much more digestible and a lot clearer,” she said.York told Cointelegraph that women also tend to feel safer in high-trust and intimate environments, with friends and peers as their information source. “Women learn from other women,” York added, pointing to community-driven educational initiatives like SheFi. York said these programs play a role in expanding female participation in the space. Saima Tariq Khan, an engineer, educator and crypto community member, echoed York’s sentiments. Khan told Cointelegraph that demystifying crypto’s intimidating vocabulary is the way to go. “What is DeFi? What do I mean by cryptocurrency? What is blockchain? First, we need to build that first level of understanding,” she said. Khan also said that while many women graduate from computer science courses, they are underrepresented in the workforce.

Diversified reportedly denied that the site was abandoned, stating it may resume gas production.However, the DEP and environmental advocates say the company has failed to meet its obligations. Under a 2021 agreement, Diversified had committed to plugging Longhorn A and 13 other wells at the end of their operational life, an obligation it has reportedly not fulfilled.An image of the site. Source: The Erie Times-NewsCointelegraph has reached out to Diversified for comment.Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execDiversified under scrutiny over business modelEnvironmentalists have long raised concerns about Diversified’s business model, which involves acquiring aging, low-producing wells and extracting remaining value without sufficient plans for decommissioning.Plugging a single well can cost over $100,000, and Pennsylvania already has over 350,000 orphaned and abandoned wells, making the stakes particularly high.A 2022 report labeled the company’s approach a “business model built to fail Appalachia,” warning that taxpayers could be left footing the bill for thousands of unplugged wells.Diversified recently agreed to plug 3,000 wells by 2034 in a separate legal settlement but continues to face regulatory scrutiny, including a probe by the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce.Horton Township officials, where the Longhorn site is located, say they’ve received no updates from the company.Local supervisor PJ Piccirillo told the Erie Times-News that generators and tanks were removed without notice. “All we know is that the property seems to have been abandoned,” he said.Related: Bitcoin mining — Institutions boost investments amid favorable US climateUS cities confront crypto miningOn April 25, the planning commission of Vilonia, Arkansas, unanimously rejected a proposal to establish a cryptocurrency mining facility within the city limits, following strong opposition from residents.In January, Arkansas lawmakers introduced a bill that would ban crypto mining operations within 30 miles of any US military facility in the state.The opposition to crypto-mining centers in Arkansas follows a broader trend across various US municipalities where crypto-mining initiatives have faced increasing scrutiny.In October 2024, a group of residents in Granbury, Texas, filed a lawsuit against Marathon Digital, alleging that its mining facility generated too much noise.Magazine: 12 minutes of nail-biting tension when Ethereum’s Pectra fork goes live",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/diversified-energy-crypto-mine-abandonment-pennsylvania?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

With the product, qualified clients can access up to $1 million in loans while keeping their BTC.Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca at the Token2049 media lounge. Source: CointelegraphBitcoin-backed loans are an “obvious” next stepRocca told Cointelegraph that growing confidence in crypto’s long-term trajectory had fueled demand for the product. This has been driven by developments leading to broader institutional adoption. “Expectations are for institutional space coming in, the ETFs, and the mood music on Bitcoin is much more about wider adoption and long-term thinking than very short-term speculation,” Rocca said. He said this shift is the key to unlocking demand for borrowing against BTC, as investors feel more secure and feel that sharp price drops are less likely to happen. The Xapo Bank CEO said that its Bitcoin-backed loans offer loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of 20%, 30% and 40%, giving borrowers flexibility while managing risk. “If you get a 20% LTV loan and you have 100 Bitcoin, as a lot of early adopters do, that’s still a couple of million dollars you can borrow without having to sell them,” Rocca said. With conservative LTV levels like 20%, Bitcoin must fall below $40,000 for borrowers to get liquidated. “We’re nowhere near $40,000,” Rocca told Cointelegraph, pointing to the current price stability as a reason for growing borrower confidence.Related: Blockchains ready for institutions, lawyers hesitate: DoubleZero CEOBorrowing helps investors avoid selling in emergenciesRocca said Bitcoin-backed loans provide a solution for holders who want to stay exposed to BTC when facing life’s unexpected expenses. “If you follow the ethos of investing, the smart thing to do would be not to sell it in three days if it goes to $100,000,” Rocca said.“But life gets in the way,” Rocca added. He told Cointelegraph that unexpected costs, like medical bills or replacing a car, often force investors to liquidate assets at unfavorable times. Rocca said that instead of selling Bitcoin for a $10,000 expense, investors could borrow against their holdings while simply paying interest on the loan.“You continue to have the upside potential of the price appreciation of the Bitcoin because you haven’t sold it,” he said. “But you get liquidity to pay for things that you need in everyday life.”With institutional adoption deepening and the Bitcoin market maturing, the Xapo Bank executive is betting that more long-term holders will be ready to tap into crypto liquidity without selling their BTC. This marks a shift from the “hodl” culture to an age where Bitcoin owners can do more with the asset. Magazine: 12 minutes of nail-biting tension when Ethereum’s Pectra fork goes live",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-backed-loans-growth-xapo-bank-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Still, BTC miner Hive Digital Technologies is doubling down on the untapped potential of the Latin American (LATAM) market.In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Hive Digital Technologies’ president and CEO, Aydin Kilic, said that Paraguay presents a compelling long-term opportunity equipped with “geopolitical stability, low-cost hydro energy, and a government open to foreign investment”.Picking up from where Bitfarms left offHive acquired Bitfarms’ 200 megawatt (MW) Yguazú facility for $56 million in January. Phase one infrastructure of a 100 MW data center at the site was completed in April, supporting five exahashes per second (EH/s) of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining.Hive plans to expand to 300 MW of mining facilities in Paraguay in 2025. It aims to increase its hashrate to 25 EH/s by September.Related: Bitfarms sells Paraguay site to Hive for $85M, refocuses on USThe CEO said Hive has spent over a year cultivating strong, cooperative relationships with local stakeholders in Paraguay. “We are investing in local hiring, training programs and strong vendor partnerships. Our goal is to create a local ecosystem of support that keeps costs stable while boosting uptime and efficiency,” he added.While there was a proposed ban on crypto mining in Paraguay due to the pressure it poses on the country’s electricity supply and potential rising electricity prices, Aydin said that their team is actively involved with policymakers to support clarity and cooperation in mining legislation.Hive embraces global diversification to hedge against geopolitical risksHive has data centers in Canada, Sweden and Paraguay. Contrasting with its ongoing LATAM expansion, the miner is relocating its headquarters to San Antonio, Texas. “Our growing presence in North and South America creates a balanced footprint resilient to geopolitical or trade policy shocks,” Kilic said.The US tariff on China raised concerns about the rising cost of mining equipment, like ASICs. Kilic told Cointelegraph that they have diversified sourcing channels for ASICs and electrical components to avoid single-region dependencies. Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execTo ensure scaling from six to 25 EH/s, the CEO said the company has locked in key ASIC orders, secured power access through long-term power purchase agreements, and expanded engineering capacity across three continents to deal with market and technological uncertainties.Profitability in Bitcoin mining is ultimately a physics equationKilic sees Bitcoin mining profit as a physics equation. He told Cointelegraph that capital and operational expenses depend on hashrate-sensitive analysis to seek the most accretive way to fund their business through BTC treasury and ATM sales.While the solo mining community may have more difficulty making profits, the CEO suggested the focus should be on the variables it can control: “Whether you run one rig or ten thousand, it comes down to controlling inputs like opex, power costs, and machine uptime to drive predictable outputs —  maximizing energy efficiency, minimizing downtime and being disciplined with treasury management.”Magazine: Korea to lift corporate crypto ban, beware crypto mining HDs: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hive-digital-expands-bitcoin-mining-paraguay-latam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-07T08:57:28.000Z,"Ethereum’s ‘Pectra’ network upgrade goes live: What to expect","Ethereum — the network that unleashed smart contracts on the world — moves on to the next chapter with today’s Pectra upgrade, but what does it mean?Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.Ethereum Pectra Consensys announcement. Source: ConsensysEIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.Finally, EIP-7691 increases the number of data blobs per block, which allows for better layer-2 scalability and potentially significantly reduces transaction fees. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of Ethereum decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch, said Pectra “introduces ‘smart account’ functionality” at deeper protocol levels and “improves Ethereum’s scalability” through layer-2 solutions.Related: Ethereum to simplify crosschain transactions with new token standardsBetter account abstraction0xAw, lead developer at Base Ethereum layer-2 DEX Alien.Base told Cointelegraph that EIP‑7702 “is a potentially great addition for Ethereum.” He said that account abstraction has so far been unable to gain traction due to the need to switch wallets.The positives of adopting such a solution include “getting rid of approval flows, not having to sign each transaction, segregated permissions and actions, and automations on behalf of the user.” 0xAw added that, following the update, developers will have an easier time implementing the features.While account abstraction “won’t magically result in mass adoption,” it still “does remove a significant barrier to entry for new people.” He added:“It enables a Web2-like UX by hiding many of the underlying scaffolding from users.”1inch’s Kunz highlighted that the update will pave “the way for native gasless transactions and simplified user flows.” Ivo Georgiev, founder and CEO of self-custodial smart wallet Ambire, told Cointelegraph that “there will be no more infinite ERC-20 approvals, and users won’t need native currency like ETH to pay transaction gas fees.” He added:“Following this, the UX will be reworked completely, with permissions/delegations systems that let wallets give more limited abilities to apps, thus increasing their overall security — for example, you won’t need the wallet popup every time you interact with OpenSea.“Still, the change is not without its downsides. According to 0xAw, it gives “users have one more dangerous thing they could sign, which would be even more damaging than an approval to wallet drainers.”Mike Tiutin, chief technology officer at onchain compliance protocol PureFi, told Cointelegraph that “drainers proved that users will sign ‘harmless’ messages in cloned DApps.” The risk will now get worse:“EIP-7702 expands that trick from one token to the whole wallet.“Georgiev is more optimistic, saying he is “confident there will not be a tangible increase in risk.” He explained, “By this point, the industry knows how to create a secure contract, especially with such a minimal scope as an EIP-7702 delegation.”Related: Vitalik wants to make Ethereum ‘as simple as Bitcoin’ in 5 yearsEasier institutional stakingArtemiy Parshakov, vice president of institutions at Ethereum staking service P2P.org, told Cointelegraph, “EIP-7002 makes institutional staking much easier to integrate without taking too much risk.” Staking service clients had to obtain a signed message from their staking service provider to be able to exit and store it securely for later.Until Pectra, stakers could not exit without the participation of the staking service provider. Those messages also couldn’t be generated until about 13 hours after starting staking — now this exit delay will be decreased to about 13 minutes.Supply validator deposits onchainAnother notable upgrade is EIP-6110. This makes the execution‑layer block carry data about new validator deposits to the consensus layer. Validator deposits are new validators joining Ethereum’s staking protocol.Until Pectra, consensus clients waited for block proposers to vote on a Merkle root that summarized deposits. Now, the execution-layer block includes (supplies) a list of new verifier deposits. This sort of upgrade makes changes very deep into Ethereum’s consensus layer, and its introduction follows client bugs breaking the Holesky and Sepolia Ethereum test networks. Still, Parshakov explained that his firm’s biggest concern “are client bugs, but we trust that respectable teams and the Ethereum Foundation are working together to prevent it from happening on mainnet.”Magazine: 12 minutes of nail-biting tension when Ethereum’s Pectra fork goes live",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-s-pectra-network-upgrade-goes-live-today-what-to-expect?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-07T08:53:00.000Z,"What is Tornado Cash, and why did it get into trouble?","What is Tornado Cash?              Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a different address. The protocol was launched to boost privacy in Ethereum-based transactions. Over time, the developers have expanded its functionality to support multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains, including BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum and Avalanche.Tornado Cash supports several ERC-20 tokens and native ETH across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. At its peak usage, Tornado Cash supported several ERC-20 tokens, including:On Ethereum: Ether (ETH), Dai (DAI), USDC (USDC), Tether’s USDt (USDT), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).On other EVM chains (via smart contract deployment): BNB (BNB), Polygon (POL), Avalanche (AVAX) and ETH on Arbitrum and Optimism.Did you know? Tornado Cash launched in 2019 as an experiment in financial privacy using just a few smart contracts. By 2022, it had processed billions in crypto transactions without ever holding user funds directly.                  How Tornado Cash works              Unlike traditional financial systems that prioritize users’ privacy, blockchain public ledgers are accessible to everyone on blockchain explorers. Tornado Cash counters this by enabling anonymous transactions through smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs.Crypto mixers typically pool and shuffle users’ funds, deduct a fee, and redistribute them. Tornado Cash, however, uses a pool-based system where deposits are commingled in a smart contract, and withdrawals to new addresses are delinked using zk-SNARKs, ensuring anonymity without random shuffling.Here’s how it works:At its core, Tornado Cash has smart contracts that break the onchain link between a sender and receiver. When a user deposits a cryptocurrency into a Tornado Cash pool, the smart contract issues a cryptographic note that the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a different wallet address without revealing the link between the two.As Tornado Cash is a decentralized protocol, the underlying smart contracts cannot be changed or destroyed by anyone, including the Tornado Cash decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).The system uses ZK-proofs, which allow a user to prove that they have the right to withdraw a specific amount without revealing what deposit was theirs. This mechanism ensures that deposits and withdrawals are mathematically linked but anonymous.Tornado Cash is non-custodial, meaning it does not hold user funds at any point. The code runs independently and cannot be altered or controlled by the developers. The funds can remain in the pool for as long as the user likes.Before sanctions, Tornado Cash was primarily accessed via its web interface by connecting a crypto wallet. Advanced users could also interact with the protocol’s smart contracts directly using a command-line interface.                  How Tornado Cash got into trouble              Tornado Cash landed in legal trouble primarily because it was allegedly used to launder billions of dollars in illicit funds, including crypto stolen in high-profile hacks. The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash on Aug. 8, 2022, under Executive Order 13694.There were several reasons behind Tornado Cash facing issues with regulators: Facilitation of money laundering: Tornado Cash was accused of facilitating money laundering, with the OFAC claiming it processed over $7 billion in virtual currency since 2019, approximately 30% of which was linked to illicit activity, per Chainalysis.Support for North Korean cybercrime: The platform was linked to laundering more than $455 million stolen by the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group.Threat to national security: The OFAC accused Tornado Cash of materially assisting cyber-enabled activities originating outside the US, posing a significant threat to US national security, foreign policy and economic stability.Lack of effective controls: The Treasury highlighted Tornado Cash’s failure to implement adequate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures, allowing malicious actors to exploit it.Obfuscation of illicit transactions: According to the OFAC, Tornado Cash was facilitating anonymous transactions by obscuring their origin, destination and counterparties, enabling criminals to hide the proceeds of cybercrimes.Tornado Cash was designed to obfuscate the entire transaction history. This feature was beneficial for privacy, particularly in use cases like payroll, donations and personal spending, where anonymity can be important. However, the very feature that made it attractive for legitimate use also made it appealing to bad actors looking to launder money or conceal illicit transactions. This drew significant attention from regulators, who became concerned about the potential for criminal activities such as money laundering, terrorism financing or other forms of illicit finance.On March 21, 2025, the US Treasury lifted sanctions imposed by the Biden administration against Tornado Cash. Did you know? In August 2022, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash smart contracts, marking the first time code, not a person or organization, was blacklisted. This sparked a heated global debate over open-source freedom.                  Debate around Tornado Cash              The action against Tornado Cash followed similar sanctions against Blender.io in May 2022, signaling a broader regulatory push to address cryptocurrency mixers. Such actions sparked a controversy in the crypto community. Critics of regulatory actions on the decentralized crypto mixers argue that sanctioning open-source code and punishing developers for creating privacy-preserving tools pose a threat to free speech and innovation. It undermines the neutrality of blockchain tools and sets a precedent where governments could censor software itself, not just its use.On the other hand, advocates of hardened regulatory sanctions say it is a necessary step to combat crypto-related crime and that illicit activity cannot be left unchecked. While the protocol does have legitimate uses, the scale of its illicit use, nearly 30% of funds tied to illicit actors, outweighed these benefits. They argue that the decentralized, non-custodial nature of the smart contracts in such protocols, which cannot be modified or controlled, complicates efforts to mitigate misuse. This leaves regulators with no option but to take action against the protocol itself to deter similar platforms from operating without safeguards.The Treasury held that the platform consistently failed to implement effective controls to prevent money laundering by malicious cyber actors. This lack of oversight allowed illicit actors to exploit the service without restriction, prompting the need for regulatory intervention to curb unchecked abuse.Nevertheless, the case has set up pressing questions about how to balance financial privacy with security and how decentralized, permissionless systems can coexist with traditional legal frameworks.Did you know? The Tornado Cash protocol is governed by a DAO, allowing tokenholders to vote on upgrades and proposals. Even after sanctions, the DAO continued to operate briefly on-chain.                  The efficacy of “sanctions” and their removal              Despite sanctions, Tornado Cash remained operational through decentralized technologies like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Tor. Its resilience led to doubts around the efficacy of sanctions on decentralized protocols and the broader implications for crypto regulation under evolving US policy.According to Chainalysis, Tornado Cash kept functioning on the dark web despite the sanctions. Its front end was available on the IPFS and via The Onion Router (known as Tor). IPFS is a peer-to-peer, distributed protocol for data storage and sharing, while Tor is open-source software enabling anonymous communication, often called the dark web.Per Flipside Crypto data, Tornado Cash saw $1.9 billion in deposits between Jan. 1 and June 30 in 2024, compared to $635.696 million in deposits during the same period in 2023.Unlike centralized services, Tornado Cash is decentralized and autonomous, making it difficult to shut down or control. But the US government targeted associated infrastructure, including GitHub repositories and websites. Developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested in the Netherlands on suspicion of concealing illicit financial flows and facilitating money laundering. Two of the co-founders, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, were charged in 2023 for involvement in more than $1 billion in money laundering.A Dutch court later suspended Pertsev’s pretrial detention. A US court determined that Tornado Cash’s smart contracts aren’t “property,” though legal experts note this doesn’t clear the founders of other charges. High-profile figures like Vitalik Buterin and Edward Snowden have publicly supported Pertsev in the matter.The Treasury stated that a review of legal and policy issues regarding sanctions in “evolving technology and legal environments” led to the repeal of sanctions. In January 2025, a US court overturned the sanctions. The ruling came after Joseph Van Loon and other Tornado Cash users filed an appeal against the sanctions, arguing that the OFAC had overstepped its congressional authority by blacklisting the mixer in 2022.In April 2025, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the US Treasury Department’s sanctions against Tornado Cash were unlawful and barred the agency from reimposing them on the crypto mixer.                  Tornado Cash sanctions repeal: What’s next for crypto privacy?              The repeal of sanctions on Tornado Cash marks a pivotal moment for decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto privacy. It underscores the challenges of regulating permissionless, immutable systems while highlighting the growing legal recognition of code as distinct from traditional property or entities.For users, the lifting of sanctions restores access to a tool designed for financial privacy, potentially boosting adoption for legitimate use cases like shielding personal transactions or protecting sensitive donations.However, the repeal does not resolve the underlying tension between privacy and regulatory oversight. Tornado Cash’s continued operation, even during sanctions, demonstrates the resilience of decentralized protocols but also their vulnerability to misuse. Regulators worldwide are likely to scrutinize similar platforms, pushing for stronger AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) frameworks, even in DeFi. This could lead to hybrid solutions where privacy tools incorporate voluntary compliance mechanisms to deter illicit activity without compromising user autonomy.For Tornado Cash itself, the future remains uncertain. While the protocol’s smart contracts are immutable, its governance via the Tornado Cash DAO could evolve to address regulatory concerns, such as implementing optional transparency features for compliant users. The legal battles of its developers — Pertsev, Storm and Semenov — are ongoing, and their outcomes could shape public perception and trust in the platform. A guilty verdict could deter developers from building similar tools, while acquittals might embolden innovation in privacy-focused DeFi.The Tornado Cash saga has also sparked broader discussions about the right to financial privacy in the digital age. Advocates argue that privacy is a fundamental right, especially in an era of pervasive blockchain surveillance, where every transaction is traceable by default. Critics, however, emphasize the societal cost of unchecked anonymity, pointing to cases like the Lazarus Group’s exploits. Striking a balance will require collaboration between developers, regulators and the crypto community to ensure privacy tools serve legitimate users without becoming havens for crime.As the crypto landscape evolves, Tornado Cash will likely influence the next generation of privacy protocols. Emerging technologies, such as advanced ZK-proofs or layer-2 scaling solutions, could enable even more robust privacy guarantees while addressing regulatory concerns. For now, the repeal of sanctions offers a reprieve for Tornado Cash and its users, but it also sets the stage for a new chapter in the ongoing debate over privacy, security and the future of decentralized finance.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-tornado-cash-and-why-did-it-get-into-trouble?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments. “In big Web2 companies, this is mandatory,” Budorin added. Dyma Budorin at the Token2049 event in Dubai. Source: CointelegraphReal-time blacklisting, a step forwardWhile crypto security approaches remained the same, post-hack security approaches shifted slightly. Budorin told Cointelegraph there were some improvements in the crypto space’s post-hack security responses. “Maybe a little shift from a post-hack approach,” Budorin told Cointelegraph, citing how security firm Chainalysis introduced near real-time blacklisting of stolen funds. He said this small improvement is a step toward progress in crypto security.“This is great because, previously, Chainalysis was blacklisting within three days when the funds were moving. And this is obviously nothing because hackers had enough time to launder, through exchanges, the stolen money,” Budorin said. On Feb. 21, the Bybit hack saw $1.4 billion in crypto stolen through a safe wallet vulnerability. This became the largest crypto hack in history. After the hack, the malicious actors laundered 100% of the stolen money in just 10 days. While faster blacklisting is a step forward, it still doesn’t address the deeper structural risks. “But in terms of the practice, cybersecurity, nothing changed,” Budorin told Cointelegraph. Related: Bybit hacker launders 100% of stolen $1.4B crypto in 10 daysCrypto losses near $360 million in April In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. Source: PeckShieldApril’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million.

Movement started with the community and our builders,“ the announcement stated.The firm promised better governance with new leadership, town halls for heightened transparency and improved vetting and verification procedures. Other, less tangible changes include “evolved leadership philosophy” and a “return to crypto’s radical roots.”Market makers at it againThe termination comes after a recently announced third-party review requested by the Movement Network Foundation into an agreement orchestrated by Manche with Rentech. Rentech then helped broker an agreement with market maker Web3Port.After the deal concluded, Web3Port reportedly sold the 66 million MOVE that it gained through the deal, about 5% of the total supply. This led to $38 million in downward price pressure in December 2024.The investigation is being conducted by private intelligence firm Groom Lake. The organization’s founder, Fernando Reyes Jr., told Cointelegraph that he “won’t reveal any information about Movement Labs or Movement Foundation without the express written consent.”Still, he hinted at developments by citing Byzantine Emperor Basil II, “The Bulgar Slayer.” He promised:“I will soon do what he did to a large swath of scammers in this industry. I will break them.“Related: How to choose a market maker for your Web3 projectMarket makers make or break tokensA mid-April analysis suggested that the right market maker can be a launchpad for a cryptocurrency project, opening the door to major exchanges and providing valuable liquidity to ensure a token is tradeable.

The protocol enables AI agents to access paid resources in real-time based on their needs and eliminates dependency on pre-paid credits, API keys, or human-managed accounts. AI agents can also provision and pay for hardware resources in real-time, access specialized data sources through micropayments, and pay other AI systems for services. The x402 protocol essentially transforms AI agents from tools that require constant human interaction into autonomous economic actors that can independently discover, purchase and utilize resources to accomplish their goals.Developers can use the protocol to monetize APIs, create software unlocks and enable metered services that dynamically charge users based on actual resource usage, while content creators can monetize their content without the need for blanket subscriptions or credit card minimums and fees.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-x402-payments-protocol-make-ai-agents-more-autonomous?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-06T19:45:00.000Z,"Bitcoin could rally regardless of what the Federal Reserve FOMC decides this week: Here’s why","Key Takeaways:The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal environment for alternative hedge assets such as cryptocurrencies.Source: Jim PaulsenEconomist and investor Jim Paulsen notes that when Fed funds trade above a “neutral” interest rate (Fed Funds minus the annual core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index), the economy has historically moved toward recession or a “growth recession,” a period of sluggish growth with rising unemployment and weak consumer demand. Similar patterns since 1971 support this analysis.According to Paulsen, the Fed will likely be compelled to lower interest rates. Moreover, central bank Chair Jerome Powell is under significant pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has criticized the Fed for not reducing the cost of capital quickly enough.Reasons why the Fed could start easingConcerns about overheated markets remain as the US consumer inflation exceeds the 2% target, and April unemployment rates of 4.2% suggest no signs of economic weakness.FOMC rates estimate for the Sept. 17 decision. Source: CME FedWatchMarket expectations, as reflected in Treasury yield futures, show a 76% chance of interest rates at 4.0% or lower by Sept. 17. This probability has dropped considerably from 90% on April 29, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders are growing less confident that the Fed will ease monetary policy. While this may initially seem bearish for risk assets, it could prompt the Treasury to inject liquidity into markets to support government spending.Regardless of the FOMC’s decision, some analysts point out that the Fed’s recent $20.5 billion Treasury bond purchase on May 5 signals renewed intervention. Additional liquidity has historically been bullish for cryptocurrencies, especially as the US dollar lags behind other major global currencies. Consequently, investors are increasingly seeking alternative hedges rather than holding cash.Related: Bitcoin price rallied 1,550% the last time the ‘BTC risk-off’ metric fell this lowDXY US Dollar Index (left, green) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphThe US Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped below 100 for the first time since July 2023, as investors retreat from US markets amid economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, gold has risen over 12% in the past 30 days and is now trading just 2% below its all-time high of $3,500. Declining confidence in the US Treasury’s ability to finance its debt favors scarce assets such as Bitcoin.While the probability of multiple rate cuts has diminished, this scenario may still be favorable for cryptocurrencies. Should the Fed be pressured to expand its balance sheet, it would likely fuel inflation and erode the value of fixed-income investment factors that ultimately support cryptocurrencies.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement. Bitcoin Risk-Off signal indicator. Source: CryptoQuantIn 2019, the same signal preceded a staggering 1,550% rally that saw Bitcoin soar above $68,000 in 2021. Data from CryptoQuant indicates that the Risk-Off signal combines six metrics: downside and upside volatility, exchange inflows, funding rates, futures open interest, and market capitalization. Collectively, they provide a balanced view of correction risk, making the signal a data-oriented gauge for market trends. The last time the Risk-Off Signal indicated a low-risk investment environment, Bitcoin was valued at $4,000. Several factors can explain the price disparity. The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in 2024 opened the floodgates to institutional capital, boosting demand and stabilizing prices. In fact, ETFs and public companies now hold 9% of the Bitcoin supply. ?LATEST: ETFs and public companies now hold 9% of Bitcoin's supply!

Historically, MCI’s RSI crossover has preceded massive rallies, such as the more than 500% surge in 2019. Combined with rising futures open interest and favorable funding rates, the MCI suggests Bitcoin could break $100,000 over the coming few weeks. Anonymous crypto analyst Darkfost pointed out that Bitcoin’s network activity index has declined sharply, reflecting reduced transaction volume and fewer daily active addresses since December 2024.

2025-05-06T15:41:51.000Z,"Is it a bull or bear market? How to tell the difference","TL;DR:Not sure if you’re in a bull or bear market? This guide breaks down how to spot the difference using price action, volume, sentiment and onchain data. Learn how to recognize market cycles, what signals to watch for and how to adjust your strategy for each phase so you can trade smarter.Crypto markets can feel like emotional rollercoasters, prices soaring one month, then crashing the next. You're not alone if you’ve ever wondered whether you are in a bull or a bear market.In the simplest terms:A bull market is when prices keep going up, people are excited and there’s a general sense that the future is bright. Think back to late 2020 and early 2021; Bitcoin (BTC) climbed from around $10,000 to nearly $70,000. New projects were launching daily and it felt like everyone from your cousin to your Uber driver was buying crypto.On the flip side, a bear market is when prices drop consistently, investors pull back, and sentiment sours. A good example? 2022. After hitting all-time highs, the market tumbled. Bitcoin fell below $20,000, projects collapsed (remember Terra?), and even veteran traders started discussing “building in the bear.”Knowing what kind of market you’re in helps you make smarter moves, and that’s why this all matters. You don’t want to ape into memecoins during a downtrend or panic-sell just before a rebound. Recognizing market phases helps you invest more strategically, manage risk and crucially, keep your emotions in check. Which, in crypto, is half the battle.Did you know? In 18th-century England, “bearskin jobbers” were early short-sellers, traders who sold bearskins they didn’t yet own, betting prices would fall. The saying “don’t sell the bear’s skin before you’ve caught the bear” stuck, and so did the metaphor. The term bull came later, not only as the bear’s opposite, but also because of the upward motion of a bull’s horns when attacking.Understanding bull and bear marketsSure, crypto is “numbers on a chart.” But, it’s also stories, headlines and entire communities’ constantly shifting mood. Here’s how to understand bull and bear cycles: 1. Bull market characteristicsa) Sustained price increasesPrices rise in a bull market, sure. What’s more important is that they keep rising, often over weeks or months. You’ll see major coins climbing steadily and altcoins riding the wave. A textbook example? Bitcoin’s run in 2020–2021, where it jumped from ~$10,000 to $69,000. That rally had momentum, institutional backing (Tesla, Strategy, etc.), and serious retail FOMO.Or Dogecoin’s meme-fueled sprint in early 2021, going from joke status to $0.45 thanks to Elon tweets and Reddit hype.b) Positive investor sentimentYou’ll know sentiment is bullish when X feels euphoric, everyone’s calling for a BTC moonshot and new projects are launching daily with sky-high valuations. Money flows in fast, and even risky bets feel like obvious plays. That’s when you know that positive investor sentiment is in the air. c) Favorable economic indicatorsBull runs often line up with low interest rates, easy access to credit and generally tech-friendly conditions. During the 2020 bull, for instance, pandemic-era stimulus checks and low borrowing costs gave retail and institutional investors more ammo to deploy into digital assets.2. Bear market characteristicsa) Prolonged price declinesBear markets will drag on until the cows come home. Prices fall, then fall some more, and every slight bounce is sold off. Think 2018’s “crypto winter,” when Bitcoin crashed from $20,000 to around $3,000.Or 2022’s brutal downturn, when BTC dropped from $69,000 to under $20,000. That crash wasn’t really about price either; it was fuelled by implosions like Terra-Luna, Celsius and the FTX scandal. The dominoes just kept falling.Bear markets tend to feel like the party’s over. b) Negative investor sentimentDuring bear phases, fear takes over. Headlines turn grim, social media goes quiet and even die-hard believers start questioning their convictions. Funding dries up, dev teams go silent and “exit liquidity” jokes make the rounds.c) Adverse economic conditionsMacro headwinds don’t help. High interest rates, inflation fears or tightening monetary policy often make things worse. In 2022, for example, the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes made risk assets, including crypto, far less appealing.Key indicators to identify market phasesWhile no single metric can give you 100% certainty, there are a handful of time-tested indicators that traders and analysts rely on. Let’s break down the indicators you can use, aside from the obvious one (price). Trading volumeVolume tells you how much conviction is behind the price moves.In a bull market, rising prices are often backed by strong trading volume. More buyers step in, more liquidity enters the market and the rally feels supported.During a bear market, volume tends to dry up. Price drops are met with weak buying pressure and it can feel like no one wants to touch the market.Low volume plus a declining price? Not a great sign if you’re hoping for a bounce.Did you know? During the 2021 bull run, Dogecoin experienced a surge in trading volume, with nearly $70 billion traded in a single day as its price soared to $0.45Market sentimentOne tool many investors rely on is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. It measures social media activity, volatility, Google search trends and more to gauge whether investors feel optimistic (greedy) or pessimistic (fearful).Extreme greed often pops up near the top.Extreme fear tends to appear near the bottom, though it can hang around in deeper downturns.Check it daily, but don’t let it drive your whole strategy. It’s a mood ring, not a crystal ball.Technical indicatorsYou don’t have to be a chart wizard to spot a few helpful signals.Moving averages: When the price is consistently above the 200-day moving average, it’s generally bullish. When it dips below, that’s often a warning sign. These are long-term trend indicators, not day-trading tools.Relative strength index (RSI): This measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold: Readings above 70 suggest it’s overheated and due for a pullback, while readings below 30 may indicate it’s oversold with potential to bounce.None of this is gospel, but it helps you get a feel for momentum.Fundamental factorsSometimes the biggest market movers don’t show up on a chart.Bullish signs might include:Big-name institutional adoption (like BlackRock applying for a Bitcoin ETF).Friendly regulatory news or court wins for crypto firms.Major tech milestones (think Ethereum upgrades or layer-2 rollouts).Meanwhile, bearish signs often look like:Regulatory crackdowns (the SEC targeting major exchanges).High-profile security breaches or protocol failures.Global instability — inflation, war or financial contagion.Once you know what to look for, the next step is figuring out where. Fortunately, crypto comes with a treasure trove of free tools if you know where to dig.Charting platforms If you want to understand price action, you need solid charts.TradingView is known for customizable charts and technical indicators.Cointelegraph offers clear overviews of prices, market caps and volume trends that are especially useful for tracking newer or smaller tokens.Did you know? TradingView’s charting tools are integrated directly into many of the world’s top crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. Sentiment analysisCrypto is more mood than math. Tools like LunarCrush track social media activity, influencer buzz and trending tokens. If Dogecoin starts heating up again, you’ll probably see the early signs there.Onchain dataWant to know what the whales are doing? Platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant surface data like wallet flows, miner activity and exchange balances. It’s like reading the blockchain’s heartbeat. You’ll often spot capital shifts before they show up in the price.Strategies for navigating different market conditionsUnderstanding the cycle is one thing. Knowing how to act on it is another. Your playbook should change depending on whether you’re riding a bull or surviving a bear.Bull market strategiesTrend following: When the market’s running hot, sometimes the best move is to go with the flow, but stay disciplined. Focus on assets in strong uptrends, and don’t get caught chasing green candles without a plan.Profit-taking: Set targets and honor them. It’s easy to get greedy when everything’s pumping, but taking profits on the way up helps you avoid the dreaded round trip: watching your gains vanish in the next drawdown.Risk management: Even bull markets pull back. Use stop-losses or trailing stops to lock in gains and guard against surprise reversals. You’ll thank yourself later.Bear market strategiesDefensive positioning: Sometimes, the smartest trade is no trade. Moving part of your portfolio into stablecoins or sticking to less volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) can help preserve capital while others panic.Dollar-cost averaging (DCA): Trying to time the exact bottom? Good luck. DCA smooths the ride by spreading your entries over time, lowering your average cost and helping you stay engaged without overcommitting.Focus on fundamentals: Bear markets strip away the noise. What survives are the projects with real use, strong teams and long-term vision. If you’re holding through a downturn, ensure you’re holding for the right reasons.By failing to prepare, you are preparing to failBull or bear, crypto never stops moving, but that doesn’t mean you have to react to every swing. Price trends, sentiment shifts, volume patterns and fundamentals can all clue you in on where you are in the cycle. Armed with the right tools and a calm mindset, you can tune out the noise and act with clarity.Markets reward preparation, and knowing whether you’re in bull territory or bear country is one of the most powerful tools you can have.Happy trading! This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-06T15:19:22.000Z,"North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview","For months, Cointelegraph took part in an investigation centered around a suspected North Korean operative that uncovered a cluster of threat actors attempting to score freelancing gigs in the cryptocurrency industry.The investigation was led by Heiner Garcia, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and a blockchain security researcher. Garcia uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online even without using a VPN.Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operative who called himself “Motoki.”Ultimately, Motoki accidentally exposed links to a cluster of North Korean threat actors, then rage-quit the call.Here’s what happened.Suspected North Korean crypto spy posed as a Japanese developerGarcia first encountered Motoki on GitHub in late January while investigating a cluster linked to a suspected DPRK threat actor known as “bestselection18.” This account is widely believed to be operated by an experienced DPRK IT infiltrator. It was part of a broader group of suspected operatives who had infiltrated the crypto gig economy through freelancing platforms such as OnlyDust.Most North Korean state actors don’t use a human face photo in their accounts, so Motoki’s profile, which had one, hooked Garcia’s attention. “I went straight to the point and just wrote to him on Telegram,” Garcia told Cointelegraph, explaining how he created an alter ego as a headhunter for a company looking for talent. “It was pretty easy. I didn’t even say the company name.”On Feb. 24, Garcia invited Cointelegraph’s South Korean reporter to join an upcoming interview for his fake company — with the hope of speaking to the suspected DPRK operative in Korean by the end of the call.We were intrigued; if we could meet with an operative, we had the opportunity to learn just how effective these tactics were and, hopefully, how they can be counteracted.On Feb. 25, Garcia and Cointelegraph met Motoki. We kept webcams off, but Motoki did not. During the interview, conducted in English, Motoki often repeated the same responses for different questions, turning the job interview into an awkward and stilted conversation.Motoki displayed questionable behavior inconsistent with that of a legitimate Japanese developer. For one, he couldn’t speak the language.Related: From Sony to Bybit: How Lazarus Group became crypto’s supervillainWe asked Motoki to introduce himself in Japanese. The screenlight reflecting off his face suggested he was frantically searching through tabs and windows to find a script to help him answer.There was a long, tense silence.“Jiko shōkai o onegaishimasu,” Cointelegraph repeated the request, this time in Japanese.Motoki frowned, threw off his headset, and left the interview.Motoki sensed something was off moments before leaving the interview.Compared to bestselection18, Motoki was sloppy. He revealed key details by sharing his screen in the interview. Garcia theorized that Motoki is likely a lower-level operative working with bestselection18.Motoki had two calls with Garcia, one of which was with Cointelegraph. In the two calls, his screenshare revealed access to private GitHub repositories with bestselection18 for what Garcia calls a defunct scam project.“That’s how we linked the whole operation and the whole cluster… He shared his screen and revealed he was working with [bestselection18] in a private repo,” Garcia said.Linguistic clues point to North Korean originsIn a 2018 study, researchers observed that Korean males tend to have wider, more prominent facial structures than their East Asian neighbors, while Japanese males typically have longer, narrower faces. While broad generalizations, in this case, Motoki’s appearance aligned more closely with the Korean profile described in the study.“Okay, so let me introduce myself. So, I am an experienced engineer in blockchain and AI with a focus on developing innovation and impactful products,” Motoki said during the interview, his eyes scanning from left to right as if reading a script.An ID card submitted to Garcia by Motoki in his job application. Source: KetmanMotoki’s English pronunciation offered more clues. He frequently pronounced words beginning with “r” as “l,” a substitution common among Korean speakers. Japanese speakers also struggle with this distinction but tend to merge the two sounds into a neutral flap.He seemed more relaxed during personal questions. Motoki said he was born and raised in Japan, had no wife or children, and claimed native fluency. “I like football,” he smiled, pronouncing it with a strong “p” sound — another hint more typical of Korean-accented English.Related: The whale, the hack and the psychological earthquake that hit HEXMotoki unveils one more North Korean tacticAbout a week after the interview with Cointelegraph, Garcia attempted to prolong the charade. He messaged Motoki and claimed that his boss had fired him due to the dubious interview.That led to three weeks of private message exchanges with Motoki. Garcia continued to play along, pretending Motoki was a Japanese developer.Garcia later asked Motoki for help finding a job. In response, Motoki offered a deal that provided additional insight into some of North Korea’s operational methods.“They told me they would send me money to buy a computer so they could work through my computer,” Garcia said.The arrangement would allow the operator to remotely access a machine from another location and carry out tasks without needing a VPN connection, which can trigger issues on popular freelancing platforms.Motoki attempts to access a US-based PC through remote applications like AnyDesk. Source: KetmanGarcia and his partner published their findings on the cluster of suspected DPRK operatives tied to bestselection18 on April 16 on open-source investigative platform Ketman.A few days later, Cointelegraph received a message from Garcia: “The guy we interviewed is gone. All his socials changed. All the chats and everything around him has been deleted.”Motoki has not been heard from since.Suspected DPRK operatives have become a recurring problem for recruiters across tech industries. Even major crypto exchanges are targeted. On May 2, Kraken reported it identified a North Korean cyber spy attempting to land a job at the US crypto trading platform.A United Nations Security Council report estimates that North Korean IT workers generate up to $600 million annually for the regime. These spies are able to funnel consistent wages back to North Korea. The UN believes those funds help finance its weapons program — which, as of January 2024, is thought to include more than 50 nuclear warheads.Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korean-spy-reveals-ties-in-fake-job-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-06T15:00:00.000Z,"Frictionless flows are Ethereum&#039;s path to economic dominance","Opinion by: Barna Kiss, CEO of MaldaAn idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threatIn traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead to higher investment. Take the European Union's pre-Brexit single market. Investment flows slowed when the United Kingdom's exit fragmented access to capital pools, as economists tracking cross-border activity noted. Ethereum faces a decentralized parallel. Rollups, particularly those that are optimistic and ZK-based, impose delays of up to a week on withdrawals and offer only patchy cross-rollup liquidity. The result is a fragmented system in which adoption slows, and capital is underused.Developers are left with two poor choices. Either they focus on one rollup and limit their audience, or fragment liquidity across several and accept inefficiencies. Neither option serves the ecosystem's long-term interests. A significant opportunity lies, therefore, with protocols that remove these frictions. They will attract more capital, operate more efficiently, and deliver better experiences.Recent: 3 reasons Ethereum could turn a cornerCapital movement must be abstracted away from the end-user. Bridges and withdrawal queues should become protocol-level concerns, not user problems. It is feasible for liquidity deployed on one rollup to satisfy demand on another, with background rebalancing ensuring solvency and efficiency. What today seems complex can be made invisible.This design shift from reactive bridging to intent-based liquidity coordination would restore composability and preserve decentralization. More importantly, it would uphold Ethereum's core principles of building open systems without central gatekeepers. Without it, users will continue to rely on centralized exchanges to bypass friction, compromising self-custody for convenience. This is not just a technical challenge — it is a philosophical one.Designing around friction is the competitive edgeDesigning around capital efficiency is becoming a competitive edge. Tomorrow's DeFi protocols will not simply compete on fees or yield. They will compete on how well they can access liquidity across a fractured landscape. The winners will be those that can fulfill a user's request wherever the user is without requiring them to move funds manually. The result will be better UX, more productive capital, and higher network stickiness.Some underlying technologies are beginning to address the problem. Ethereum-native rollups, planned after a hard fork in 2026, promise closer integration, and while they are still not ready for deployment, based rollups offer tighter alignment with Ethereum by sharing sequencing and improving settlement while sacrificing some independence. In the meantime, optimistic rollups are racing to implement zero-knowledge proofs to speed up exits. These innovations reduce friction, but they are not enough on their own. Scale will come from applications designed around these constraints, not from the base layers alone.Zk-Rollups are particularly well suited for this. Their cryptographic structure allows for low-latency and trust-minimized messaging between chains. This makes them ideal for applications like payments, decentralized trading, and real-time financial products, all of which demand speed and certainty. If Ethereum can make such cross-rollup flows seamless, it will not just scale. It will become the backbone of a more efficient financial system.That outcome is not guaranteed. Tariffing rollups may serve short-term goals, but in the long run, they would weaken the very network Ethereum aims to strengthen. Solana, for example, already offers composability within a single domain. While Ethereum's modular approach is arguably more robust, it cannot afford to ignore the usability cost of fragmentation.Ethereum's greatest strength is its neutrality. That should include the ability of capital to move freely within its ecosystem. The future will not be built by taxing rollups. It will be built by enabling them to function as one economic engine.Opinion by: Barna Kiss, CEO of Malda.
